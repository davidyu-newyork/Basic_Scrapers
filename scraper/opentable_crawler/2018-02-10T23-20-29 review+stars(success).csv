" This is an amazing restaurant. Everything is so prefect. Every dish was just so delicious. If I can rate more than 5 points, I would. Must go place ",5
" As always, Gramercy Tavern does not disappoint! The tasting menu was superb, the wines delicious and the service on point. ",5
 Amazing! Loved the food and the staff. Loved the atmosphere. Love the low-key chill vibe. Lots of beautiful people there. ,5
 Had a phenomenal experience here. Service and food are fantastic ,5
 Outstanding. ,5
" We went in blind and sort of missed the $195 set menu plus tax and plus service thing. It left a rather giant lump in the throat the days leading to the meal but it disappeared once we entered the door off Extra St (so extra). This place could have been the most pretentious place in Manhattan, however the staff feel relaxed, punky music plays as you sit down in the most comfortable seats known to the human behind. The chefs, all smiling before you are busy preparing you insane delights. Ko's site said 12-15 dishes, maybe we were just lucky but we got 19 dishes including a little secret something to take away. We were politely full by the end. Not too much, not too little. Go for the earliest slot possible else you might have your entire meal ruined by seeing other people's meals sitting across from you.  It was expensive as hell, but you know what, every penny was worth it. ",5
" The food was extraordinary.  Thea, our server, our server was delightful and friendly.  When we arrived at 6:15, the dining room was quiet and intimate but became louder as the night went on.  The ambiance was warm and inviting.  We were celebrating our 20th anniversary and the experience was better than expected. ",5
" Gramercy Tavern is a must do dining experience. One of USHG’s Crown Jewels expectations were high. Generally they lived up to them. Service was a little slow to start. They took a drink order right away but it took a little to long for our server to get to us with the menus. Once he did though all was well. The pace, after the slow start, was perfect. Service was impeccable.   The food (tasting menu) ranged from excellent to transcendent, save for the dessert, which was just okay. We enjoyed both tasting menus, allowing us to sample twelve different dishes. So glad we did. Chef Anthony’s vegetable tasting menu is not to be missed. He treats vegetables as a star, not as an obligation to fill the needs of vegetarians.    About note on the dessert course. The beet sorbet, served as a prelude to the listed dessert course, was far superior to our two desserts. Mind you, they were quite delicious, but underwhelming when compared to all of the other amazing flavors we were served.  The beet sorbet and pumpkin spiced truffle saved the dessert course  All in all it was a spectacular dinner and we would, without hesitation, return. ",5
" My wife and I were celebrating our 2nd wedding anniversary.  We elected to have the tasting menu, and I had the wine pairing.  The food was good, but the service was lacking.  The paired wine was often poured 15+ minutes before the paired dish.  Things completely fell apart with dessert.  We waited over an hour for our dessert to show up.  When it did (poached pear with ice cream) the pear was cold.  And the table directly next to us, received their dessert before we did, even though we had been waiting longer.  Disappointing service from a restaurant known as a high-end institution in New York City.  We were offered a small discount on our check, but for a $470+ meal, I expected much better. ",2
 We were served 4 exceptional meals! Special treats before and after our meals were a surprise and wonderful. ,5
 The food is fantastic and the restaurant is beautiful.  Highly recommended. ,4
" As close to perfection as it gets!  Gramercy Tavern provided us with a perfect lunch, service and professionalism!  Great choices, and gluten free! ",5
" Excellent dinner with attentive service.  Wonderful, comfortable atmosphere.  Looking forward to a return visit soon. ",5
" Upon entering the private gate and being greeted by name by the valet and escorted to the table we had high hopes. Unfortunately the service didn't match the first 5 minutes of arrival. It took me asking for service to get a glass of wine. The demeanor of the waiter was one of irreverence. The food was good, but soured by the service. This included having to hail the waiter for a second glass (and I'm not that impatient).  The grounds are beautiful. The main house, where the restaurant is, is great. Ask for the table by the fireplace.   Downstairs is a bar with pool, shuffleboard and fooseball. While that sounds cheesy, it fit very well and was done tastefully.   All in all we are unsure the price had equaled the service we would typically expect. It would be as easy p as smiling and asking if we have enough to drink.   100% wheelchair accessible. ",3
" Winvian is hands down the best restaurant experience you will get.  From arriving at the gate, greeting by valet, the restaurant and most notably the food, it is amazing in every regard.  If you are looking to have an elegant meal at a special place look no further.   It is a little pricey but you get what you pay for.  The meal options always change and they are very diverse.  The culinary creativity is amazing. ",5
 The evening was wonderful. Everything perfect EXCEPT the fireplace was smoking and I had to take the clothes I wore to the cleaners the next day. Regretfully I’ve had the same problem several times in different dining rooms. I would dine there far more frequently if you could solve this proble. ,4
 Wonderful dining experience in a beautiful setting. ,5
 Winvian is rather pricey. For the $$$$ they charge for a night's stay they should include some minor amenities at no charge. That being said they do include a wonderful breakfast with your stay and their cottages are so wonderfully unique. But it may end up being a once in a lifetime experience. ,5
" An incredible dining experience from the ambience to the wonderfully prepared menu choices. The staff was top notch and    Although priced higher, you certainly leave feeling that you’ve received a great value!! ",5
" Top notch! By far, the best meal I have ever experienced. Service, ambiance, food quality - all excellent! ",5
" For most people this is a special occasion place but be warned that it will increase your desire for more special occasions.  The flavors are wonderful, the service impeccable and the ambiance perfect country. It is pricey but it is fixed price for three or four courses so there are no surprises (except maybe the charge for water).  Service is always ready when you are but never hovering. The blends of garden fresh ingredients far surpasses the ""farm to table"" craze and is masterfully done with style and perfection. There are few places in the  world that offer a more rewarding dining experience. ",5
 We were here for a return visit. The place was very noisy due to a family reunion where there were 17 children under 13. We think we should have been given a call about this prior to arrival.  Really changed our stay. Place was not equipped to handle this ,3
" Unfortunately they ran out of the dessert we said we wanted, but did not order it at the time  our order was taken. It was only 8:30, but they ran out of chocolate soufflés. I would have thought they could have anticipated the demand for it. ",4
 Exceeded expectations !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ,5
" Everything was just perfect, except the price.  It was very expensive.  The only time we would consider dining at the Winvian again is for a very special occasion. ",5
" Winvian has never disappointed with the quality of the food, the ambience, or the service. The tasting menu has so many great options we couldn't choose between some of them and ended up ordering both and sharing! Summer and Fall are especially nice times to go as the majority of vegetables come from the gardens at Winvian and are so fresh - you can really taste the difference. This past meal, another guest arranged a surprise fireworks show for his wife's birthday and all the diners went outside to watch the show. It was truly special and fun! We love this spot and will come back again and again. ",5
 We celebrated Rob's birthday and stayed at Winivan. Everything was amazing! From complimentary gourmet breakfast to our amazing dinner celebration. Food was fabulous. Thank you ,5
 Super.. wonderful experience.. have a cocktail on the terrace before  dinner and drink in the Litchfield countryside ,5
 Fanstastic food and service.  Just very pricey to go there too often. ,4
" We stayed here for our 5 year anniversary.  My husband will often say that he's slightly disenchanted with the whole farm to table movement but we were both blown away by the quality of the ingredients and how they all seemed to shine in the well composed dishes.  There was nothing we would change about the meal and was everything we ever hoped farm to table would be.  Excellent, excellent experience!  Thank you for making our anniversary so special and for giving us such a spectacular meal! ",5
" Great food, charming service! ",5
" This was a treasure of a find!  Exceptional food, we had steak &amp; a side salad. The salad was very creative, a land mine of wonderful flavors, and visually splendid.   The wine was delicious for a budget wine (""Educated Guess"")although they have an extensive wine list ranging from $14/glass to $2600/bottle (from what I saw, they mayhave offer more?) and the dessert really made the meal, small but Wow!  We smiled the entire time. ",5
 The food and presentation was outstanding.  It is not just a dinner it is an experience. ,5
" Superb all around! Our experience at Winvian was first class. From the moment we entered the property, to the impeccable attention to detail, everything associated with this meal was outstanding. The grounds are beautiful. The restaurant is perfect for romance. The service is attentive, but not overpowering. The food is superb. We absolutely love the Winvian. ",5
" Super fancy- like too fancy. It seemed like the other (loud, obnoxious) customers were there to prove that they could go to the fanciest spot, and weren't really appreciative of the sustainability of the food. Also, I know that the restaurant doesn't grow ALL of its own food, and I would have liked to know the other farms they work with.b ",4
" Much better than 2 yrs ago.  Should offer a la carte selections instead of just pre fix starting at $99/person, and should not force the diner to pay a 20% tip on a $130 meal with 1 glass of wine per person ",5
 Hands down best of the best.  Amazing food preparation. ,5
 Absolutely perfect! The food the service and the setting all flawless ,5
" Tucked away in Morris, this gem is wonderful for any special occasion. Service is impeccable. Warm and efficient without being hovering. We enjoyed lunch there this past weekend. Our table over looked the grounds which are lovely even in the bare winter months. Our meal was fabulous  from appetizer to dessert. We left feeling content, happy and pampered. ",5
" Lovely evening in front of fireplace, loved the pork belly and pasta appetizers, bass and duck entrees and soufflé and cheese plate for dessert. Perfect service, a special night out. ",5
 Lovely relaxing romantic awesome meal in a beautiful setting! ,5
" The very creative dishes were only surpassed by the excellent, friendly service.  Our birthday event for two couples could not have been better.  From the moment you enter Winvian you are greeted like a guest in a private home. The atmosphere and the many charming rooms for dining allow for a quiet, personal place for special occasions or for anytime you want to be pampered with excellent, quality, creative food and superb, professional service.  The timing of the service was impeccable allowing us to savor each course without feeling rushed. The chefs surprise extras were delicious and very welcome. A must visit for anyone demanding perfection. ",5
" In overall the restaurant is excellent, the food is amazing, the kitchen staff super friendly and nice. The only thing that I would change is the music. ",5
 It was a wonderful experience! I will definately recomend to my closest friends! Thank you ,5
" Everything we expected and more. Just when you think a given course was the best thing you ate, they blow your mind with the next course ",5
 Food was not bad. However I got sick afterwards; could have been the duck which I overate. ,2
" Outstanding restaurant by David Chang in the East Village ! Get a seat at the Counter and enjoy the show. The only thing which could be considered as disappointed is the value, not as good as everything else. ",5
" incredible meal, pricey but worth every penny.  Service &amp; Food our outstanding.  A great night out. ",5
 It's the best ,5
" The taste is like roller coaster. There are courses that are so good and outstanding, but there are some tasted at an average line.   The most surprise thing is that they offer 18 courses for the tasting menu. I believe that is also why there are differences in the taste.   However. I still give 5 star because of several outstanding courses. ",5
 Food and drink very mediocre for the price. Terrible value. Price point was extremely off.  Dessert however was very good. Would not recommend and I’m a big fan of David Chang. ,2
 Thank you guys so much for having us! It was a real pleasure to come and dine! Everything was absolutely delicious! Your meat section was especially impressive... the duck and the beef were outstanding! Hope you have an amazing year and all the best for 2018 ,5
" Food was really disappointing, nothing outstanding. ",1
 Superb service and gracious staff. Food was brilliant. Made creative alternatives addressing my food allergies. Really went out of their way. ,5
 Amazing food! We go back every year and have a wonderful time every timr ,5
" A fantastic experience, multi faceted in terms of taste, texture and service and can even be a little overwhelming at first. Try to isolate a single element, or dish, or wine as the standout and I reckon you're missing the trick, it's the way they come together in front of you as your evening unfolds that's where the real magic lies. Would definitely go back! ",5
 Excellent service and food was phenomenal. ,5
 Amazing! Highly recommended. The staff is súper friendly and the food was just amazing!!! ,5
 This is what I expected from a Michelin two star. Dinner tasting menu is definitely one of the best in town. ,5
" absolutely delicious! Well thought tasting menu, courses were very consistent through out the 2.5hr dinner! Love the wine list as well. Services was outstanding as well. ",5
 Houston was great and the service generally was impeccable. ,5
 Service and food quality at its finest ,5
 Must try.. great flavor and creativity. The staff's are SUPER NICE!  Recommend the counter seating to get the experience of watching them prepare all the dishes. ,5
" One of the best meals I've ever had. Everything was creative and delicious. The dinner was paced really well and each course flowed into the next nicely. My girlfriend and I don't always like ""fine dining"" type experiences, but this was very low-key in that regard. Definitely not pretentious or snooty in any way. The staff was amazing. They did not hover over us, but as soon as either of us were done with our course or our drink, someone was there to take away the plate or ask if we wanted another drink. They weren't hovering but they were clearly paying very close attention.  I would highly recommend Ko. ",5
 Wonderful experience.  Can’t wait to go back! ,5
 Excellent！I enjoyed the whole meals and I can‘t love more. Each dish was charming and delicious，and the service was great！Plan your trip to momofuku ko，I promise you will never be disappointed！ ,5
 Culinary indulgence with attention to detail and uber creative. ,5
 This was my second time dining at the new location and it keeps getting better.  The creativity and presentation were amazing and the staff was outstanding. ,5
" Our experience was what I would call “the modern, reinvented fine dining of NYC”. Unique and authentic in all details.  Thank you! ",5
" Sit back, relax, make a friend, enjoy the journey! ",5
 This place left me speechless. David Chang is more then a chef. ,5
" FABULOUS CREATIVE DINING EXPERIENCE!  AN EVENING OF SUCH FINE FOOD AND SERVICE THAT ANYONE WHO TRUELY APPRECIATES FINE FOOD AND EXCEPTIONAL SERVICE SHOULDNOT MISS. ALTHOUGH OBVIOUSLY HIGH PRICED, IT WAS WORTH EVERY ONE OF MY HARD EARNED DOLLARS. YOU WILL NOT FIND THIS ANYWHERE ELSE BUT AT DAVID CHANG'S HANDS ( and mind)! ",5
" Fourth time here (3 at this location, 1 at the original), and our meals have been flawless and special each time. I gave it only a ""good"" for value simply because this is not where anyone should go if they're looking for a deal. This is a sexy restaurant with innovative and sexy tasting menu and wine pairing that's perfect for adventurous and discriminating eaters celebrating a special occasion. The Momofuku franchise has plenty of other great budget-friendly options if that's what one is looking for. ",5
" The food here is interesting. Like nothing else. Despite there only being 20 or so seats, there's no starting time for meals and so it's somewhat strange with people coming and going. ",4
" The food was excellent, the service was on point - they were on top of everything without being annoying. The only comment I have is some dishes seem out of season (chilled soup and ice cream in December?). ",4
 Everything was very good. The food was amazing and very innovative. The only thing I didn’t like were two staff members who gave a pretencious  vibe to the place while the others were attentive and very nice. It was just a huge contrast. The place is expensive but for a special occasion is the perfect place to go! ,5
" It was our anniversary so we treated ourselves to the drinks pairing menu, was great not to have to think about what wine to order when you don’t know the food menu ahead but the number of drinks were too many for me, especially with the smaller starter portions. Food was lovely &amp; the experience of sitting around the prep area with the chefs explaining each course was wonderful. The chefs are great fun &amp; happy to engage with you. Just wish we’d booked earlier so we could’ve started our meal before 9.30pm, finishing 13 courses at 1am was a lot!  Defo worth it ",5
" Creative food, good service. My only wish was that there were more vegetable dishes and more hot dishes. Felt that most of the dishes were on the room temp or cold. But I am just nitpicking. Great restaurant and good food. ",4
" Too expensive, not the best Michelin ",3
" Truly splendid and top notch!  Prefer this meal over that of Blanca, which was somewhat spotty. ",5
 Great experience. Some plates are magnifique.. but not all. ,5
" Amazing, as always! ",5
 This is my favorite restaurant ,5
" Beautiful mix of high class cuisine, superb service and relaxed vibe. Fantastic. ",5
" Gramercy Tavern was wonderful. My husband and I went there the day after my 50th birthday, we are from Northern California but love to celebrate our big milestones in NYC, and this was our first time at this restaurant. We got the prix fixe and every dish was incredible. I loved the elegant waitstaff and how discreet and non-overbearing they were, I loved the setting, and we thought each and every one of our dishes was spectacular--I had the squash salad, which was really a lobster salad with shaved brussels sprouts and a squash-based sauce, and it was heavenly, and my husband had the cavatelli which had the most amazing bolognese sauce either of us had ever tasted. And our main courses were incredible, too. Would return in a heartbeat, if we didn't live on the West Coast. ",5
" Every bite was an explosion of flavor, from the small garnish to the entree.  The selections were unusual and so fresh.  The dressings were wonderful, and we were pleasantly surprised by the little ""extras"" such as duck pate, pea soup, breads and cookies.  It was so nice that the holiday decorations were still up, and we were thrilled with the roaring fire, and only 3 tables in our room ",5
" Simply outstanding!  Impeccable service and extraordinary cuisine complimented by an extensive wine list, and located in the most beautiful setting. ",5
 Hand made pasta great. Cheese board excellent. Dining room was open most seats have outside view and had quiet crowd. ,5
 Highly recommend. From beginning to end a 5 star experience! ,5
 I'm not the type to eat vegetables as a main course.... except at this restaurant from their garden.  Ridiculous.  Who thought a green pea could be as delicious as a sizzling steak?! ,5
" Food quality and presentation was excellent.  Service struck just the right tone. Informed, charming, seemed to appear only when needed, without beckoning.  Clearly, the staff was attuned to our schedule, not their schedule.  An important thing at a place this exclusive and expensive. ",4
" Winvian is a top end, elegant restaurant in a relaxed, pleasant country atmosphere..  The menu is limited but imaginative.  Each dish is memorable.   The wine list is extensive, and also pretty pricey.  My only hesitation in recommending Winvian is that the cost is high, particularly for the area.  Would have to be a special occasion for me. ",4
" This was our second trip to Winvian ,not sure if it was any better than the first trip which was amazing.The service and the food are excellent ,the restaurant and the grounds are beautiful well worth the trip . Looking forward to spending a night at one of the cabins . ",5
 Everything about the Sunday afternoon lunch I shared with a dear friend was perfect.  Service was attentive but not intrusive or rushed. The view was bucolic and the food delicious and appropriate sized portions.   I am eagerly looking forward to my next visit. ,5
 Awesome customer service... above &amp; beyond! ,5
 Delicious food and outstanding service. We highly recommend this place and will go back again ourselves. ,5
 We had an absolutely wonderful lunch....as always..... we feel so at home at your restaurant. The complimentary desserts were so thoughtful and made us feel special.  Can’t wait to come back....many thanks.... ,4
 Great wait staff!! ,5
" The Gramercy Tavern is always a treat, for a true New York dining experience. Careful blend of flavors with every hand crafted plate. We enjoyed the Chef’s Tasting menu with wine pairings. The service was attentive, friendly and professional. Pricey but worth it for the occasional special evening. ",5
" Fantastic all around.  We were there for a business discussion, though, and found ourselves struggling to hear and talk over all the crowd noise. ",5
 Awesome experience.  Great food and service. ,5
" The type of place that makes your watch stop ticking. They pick my food every time, and every time is just so special. Great job! ",5
" Excellent restaurant, excellent food and service, pricey but worth it.  Tasting menu was exceptional. ",5
" For a long time, Gramercy Tavern was one of my top 3 restaurants in NYC.  However, I was stunned by the price increases in the past year.  Their tasting menus offer good food but at a ridiculously high price at dinner time.  It is not worth it and I will now need to move on. ",2
" my parents 46th anniversary, food was amazing, server was professional and friendly. Ambiance is beautiful had champagne toast waiting for their celebration and a mini adorable, delicious cake. what class, such a nice touch. ",5
" What a great meal we had! We were in the dining room for lunch, but due to our time restraint we couldn’t do the tasting. The server helped us order and create a lovely meal to fit our needs and even had the grilled oyster Florentine brought over from the tavern side. Every dish was done to perfection with the best ingredients and the flavors are just right. We will remember this meal and shall return the next time we are in the city! ",5
" I have eaten here several times over the last 10 years and I am amazed that the experience, particularly the service, is always able to hold up to (or exceed) the last time. The staff is friendly and accommodating while still maintaining excellent table service. I had set high expectations for my friend and I think she was surprised that I was not exaggerating. They accommodated her sensitivity to red wines for our pairings with the tasting menu and knocked it out of the park for both of us (because I definitely wanted the reds!) The extra time and effort this took never came across as an inconvenience. We have both spent many years in the restaurant business and often get spoiled by friends when we dine out locally. This meal felt like we were friends with the owner and being given special treatment. The food was thoughtful, seasonally perfect, and expertly and creatively paired. Can't say enough about how much I love this NY institution. Thank you! ",5
" Amazing.  Everything bout the meal was amazing.  Service was on point, timing was perfect, an food was top notch.  One of the best meals I've ever had. ",5
 Great service. Food was very good but not outstanding. ,4
 Top notch! ,5
" Gramercy Tavern rarely disappoints.  Food, service and environment are consistently great. ",5
 Wonderful and very knowledgeable staff.  No rushing and the food was superb. ,5
 I have been dining at Gramercy Tavern for over twenty years. One of my favorite aspects about the restaurant has been the warmth and ambiance. Now it seems so structured ( no more ala cart) and wait staff has very cold vibe ,3
 The food and service were fantastic...I mentioned my niece had her 21st  birthday a few weeks past and the waiter brought out a beautiful dessert just for her...it was a magical night!! ,5
 Great service! Great food! Love the tipping included service! ,5
 Our favorite restaurant in the country! Everything is always perfect! ,5
" This was a first time at Gramercy Tavern and it was excellent. We entertained a couple where we are actually the client and all had a good time. This was their first time there, also. ",5
 Impeccable experience. Service was on point and the food was spectacular. Highly Highly Recommended! ,5
 素晴らしい雰囲気で、良質な食材、そして洗練されたサービスで、安心して人を招待出来る店です。 ,4
" Birthday dinner, excellent and will definitely be back! ",5
" This was the single best meal of my life.  I will remember the Duck breast and cabbage course long after I forget my kids names!  j/k but seriously this meal was steller, the flavors are unexpected, thoughtful, and elegant. ",5
 FANTASTIC IN EVERY WAY - thank you to everyone !!!! ,5
 Absolutely outstanding!!! One of the best meals of my life. ,5
 Just Impecable!!! They made my birthday dinner unforgettable... ,5
" Visited with my son and his two friends. Service was excellent and wine list robust. I was a little concerned going into the evening that the menu might veer towards the precious but definitively not the case here. Everything was spot on, and only as complex as absolutely necessary. No wasted thoughts or trivia for the sake of trivia here.  Nice location too, got to watch street kids in their Supreme gear go at it in the alley outside. Go, and order a nice Montrachet to start, you won't regret it. ",5
" That was, without a doubt, one of the greatest meals I have ever had in my life.  I cannot describe how incredible it was from start to finish - you simply must go! ",5
 Amazing restaurant! Can’t wait to come back ,5
 A great meal with personalized service ,5
" It was very good, but it used to be absolutely fantastic - we just felt it had slipped ab it in both charm and creativity since it's halycon days in the original space.  Staff was charming and top notch.  Still go, you'll have a very good meal and hopefully they'll be back to stunning again soon. ",4
" Great tasting menu, showcase great product and techniques. ",5
" Tucked away and low profile so if you are new to Ko, leave some extra time to find it. Ambience was relaxed and very conducive to great conversation. Food was innovative and delicious. Service was solicitous, gracious, and very welcoming. Pricey, but would I spend the money for this meal again? Yes, in less than a heartbeat. ",5
 The noise level was terrible....impossible to hear the presentation of the menu and to have conversations at the table. Awful music!! Service and menu: perfect😋 ,4
" Dish for dish probably not quite as good as some of the restaurants on the top 100 list where we have dined,  but maybe even more creative.   Everything else up  two its amazing reputation! ",5
 Outstanding food and service. Momofuku Ko has ruined my husband and I for life. We will book this restaurant on every trip to the city. The GM and beverage director were top notch and the tasting menu was incomparable. A must do in NYC. ,5
 Amazing Dining Experience!! Food and presentation of all courses were outstanding!! Staff was super friendly and accommodating! Truly a gem in the heart of the East Village!! ,5
" Enjoyed so much with creative, not pretentious foods and great wines . Looking forward to try again in different season. ",4
" We were a family of five, my wife and I having becom 70, and our grown up children, visiting NY from Sweden, wanting a special dinner. We got it!  The tasting menu including the wine package was marvelous, indeed! We got ten delicious servings plus appetizer, each with a taste matching wine. Nothing was traditional, but it was creative and ee loved it. Also the music had great variation and creativity. We got a nice round table, the restaurant is not crowded with tables, so all the good chance for conversation and joy.  Altogether the best resaturant experience we have had. ",5
" This was one of the most special, memorable dining experiences I have ever had. The food was delicious, with layers of flavor and combinations of ingredients were inspired; the service was friendly and perfect; the decor was industrial and chic. their attention to detail, especially if you had a food issue, which we did, was spot on. Loved the flight with the meal; it just added an additional layer to the meal. ",5
" Honest and true flavors, mixed delicately but substantially to give a euphoric experience in one or two bites. The meal was extremely filling, almost too much to handle. But the menu was pleasantly surprising and reintroduced us to familiar flavors in a unique and thoughtful manner. The servers were patient and listened to our requests, the chefs were knowledgeable and charming. But overall this place is defined by the quality of the ingredients and the imaginative and creative way they are put together. Enjoy yourself at this, still fantastic, establishment. ",5
" I seriously missed the point of this restaurant. It's location is questionable, some strange people outside it, and inside it offers little style and class. Probably a better experience around the kitchen. The table dining is totally unsuitable for children, and the cost of the experience is quite frankly ridiculous. I can't complain about the service however, that was very good! ",2
" We made a reservation for the table seating because we couldn't get counter seating. Definitely ask if there are any cancellations because we got lucky and were able to sit at the counter, which is a much better experience. The tables are ok, but lack the immediacy of seeing the food being prepared just for you. I loved the presentations and all the chefs are personable and happy to talk with you about the food. The best we had were the duck, the ice cream, the uni, and the interesting presentations of the vegetables and sauces all along the way. Service was excellent and unobtrusive. I think the wine pairing prices are too high, but there are some very special wines and other alcohols served. Definitely interesting food options. Our dietary needs were catered to easily and without fuss. Hope to be able to return. ",5
" Phenomenal experience from the moment I walked in the door. Amazingly friendly, brilliant staff ( thank you Chase, Casey, Jess &amp; more). Each course memorable, beautifully presented by knowledgeable chefs. Best &amp; most enjoyable meal I've had in recent memory. Thank you so much, Momofuku Ko staff. Just incredible. ",5
 Absolutely amazing &amp; delicious! ,5
" Ohhhhh the duck! And the basil oil. And the wild rice ice cream.  And absolutely everything else too! A truly exceptional meal. Approachable, friendly and informative staff. Great art. Phenomenal overall experience. ",5
 Best food by far! I honestly believe this restaurant deserves 3 stars Michelin if it would've have more then 2 seating tables. Very similar to Atera from many points of view. ,5
 Amazing everything ,5
" Our annual glorious splurge! An incomparable dining experience. Never quite sure of what we are eating, but always splendid. ",5
 Amazing! Great food and experience throughout. ,5
 Wonderful ! Amazing culinary experience ,5
 Extraordinary experience. Wonderful staff! Divine!!!! ,5
" We went to Per Se on a Friday night. We had the chef's menu. The tapioca with caviar was outstanding. The lobster, the grouper and the duck were really good.  All the desserts were tasty and different: the chocolate with pepper was my favorite, My husband really liked the banana bread ice cream.  Obviously, the service was memorable, they’re constantly take careful of us. ",5
 Not quite worth the price point ,3
" Let’s first start with service being amazing, down to the menu being customized.  Everyone was so friendly.  The dishes were good but not amazing, maybe it was my mistake, but  at the price point it should be amazing.  However it might have been just tonight’s menu since they are changing it daily...others may have a different experience.  I just felt I’ve paid far less for a chefs tasting menu that was damn near perfect - this felt over rated and tourist trapish. ",3
" the food is too salty , it doesn't worth the money at all.   compared with the other two michelin 3 stars restaurant(Le Bernardin &amp; Jean George) I've tried, Per Se has the worst food taste.  I am really disappointed. the dessert part is the worst experience ever,  it didn't look pretty, and the flavour is so strange,  i never tasted such a bad michelin dessert.  Don't we pay almost $3000 just for a 3 stars reputation?  So i will never back come and eat again. ",1
 Simply extraordinary!!! ,5
 Exceptional in every way! ,5
 Fabulous experience.  Our server Daniel was wonderful and we had an amazing dinner. ,5
" Per Se is excellent, top notch.  Each course is excellent, from the most creative and delicious amuse bouche I’ve ever had to the overwhelming (but delicious) array of “assorted desserts.”  Most notably, the service is absolutely impeccable—the staff caters to every need and, while very professional, do not come off as stuffy and do not take themselves or the haute dining experience you’re enjoying too seriously.  Per Se is without a doubt a once in a lifetime dining experience—unless you are fortunate enough to go there more than once. ",5
 Spectacular ! ,5
 What an incredible experience. Dining and service was impeccable. ,5
 It was a Bucket List item for my husband and I to finally visit one of Thomas Keller's restaurant.  From beginning to end it was an amazing culinary adventure that did not disappoint - it delighted:) ,5
 Surpassed expectations ,5
" Outstanding dining at a classic New York establishment. The menu was phenomenal, as was the presentation and service. Winds were excellently paired. ",5
" Absolutely memorable experiences.Service was outstanding, food to die for, wines off the charts amazing! ",5
" I can't overstate how tremendous of an experience this was.  The restaurant is small, only ~20 or so tables, but the space is voluminous yet quiet so you nearly feel as the experience is all your own.  The staff at every level are consummate professionals and take great care of you.  The food was elevated to an art form, in some cases literally.  We found ourselves anxious to dive in to every course, but hesitant to ruin the visual expression in front of us.  The prix fixe, nine course menu changes often, so what we had may not be relevant the next time.  That said, the black truffle tagliatelle was flawless.  After selecting the truffle from a wooden box, the server shaved so much wafer-thin goodness on top of the pasta, it was hidden entirely.  And the Wagyu filet was literally the finest preparation of meat I've ever had.  You'll leave well satisfied, but not overstuffed.  Just right.  Lastly, the wine list was extensive and impressive with a wide range of values, not surprisingly skewed heavily toward French.  Bouchon is one floor below, so grab some pastry on your way out.  Easily top 5 culinary experience of my life, and possibly #1. ",5
" Phenomenal experience. Everyone is courteous, attentive, and ready to help. Food was delicious and beautifully presented. Don't let the small size of each plate fool you, it adds up! We were full by dessert time. ",5
" A wonderful meal, a great view and superb service! Can't wait to return. ",5
 Staff could not have been more wonderful. They have us a tour of the kitchen after our meal and the food was exceptional ,5
 Some dishes were phenomenal while one or two fell short of expectations or appeared to be fillers in a 9 course menu.  I would have preferred fewer courses comprised of just the sensational dishes.  Even though the cost per person included the service fee it was a bit overpriced and the wine tasting was hugely over priced.  I enjoyed the one time experience but would prefer to return to places such as Grenouille and Le Bernardin. ,3
" I was sceptical about this place after reading the reviews, but surprisingly we enjoyed it a lot .Food was very good, ambience perfect, service good.  I visited most of michlen restaurants in Paris and I love the fact that the dishes were salted exactly like in Paris- perfect. Size of portions- excellent to enjoy and not overeat.  We plan to be back to try vegetarian menu. ",5
" Great restaurant! We had dinner on my son’s 18th birthday, and we got many surprises! It was really enjoyable. The food is fantastic and beautiful. The service is wonderful. Everything is perfect. ",5
 It’s an experience of a lifetime! ,5
" Incredible restaurant and experience. Not for the financially challenged.  Getting a bottle of champagne, a bottle of white, and a bottle of red and the straight-forward fixed price menu, you can expect to pay $600 a person. It was my 50th birthday and a splurge. I will always remember the food and the bill. ",5
" I can’t say enough about this restaurant.  The food, the service, the entire experience was excellent.  Thanks for making out 10th Anniversary so memorable and delicious. ",5
" food, service, and atmosphere, everything was beyond expectations. look forward to coming back for another special occasion. ",5
 Jake was fantastic as was each course!!! ,5
 My husband and I have been wanting to check out Per Se for the longest time however we were both slightly underwhelmed. The food was excellent but there was not enough of it- especially for $340 a person. They fill you up with 7 different desserts at the end. ,3
 It was definitely worthwhile. Flavours were unconventional without trying too hard. Great progression of tastes through the menu. The venue is definitely upmarket but service was personal and atmosphere relaxed.  Extensive wine list but some reasonable choices at the lower end.  The slow cooked beef and wagyu very different styles as expected but both excellent.  We had a really lovely night ,5
" The food was excellent as always. However, there was a little less creativity and individual attention to each dish from an artistic standpoint. Half the fun of the restaurant is the presentation and the arrangements were made with a little less care and attention than previously. In addition, I would have preferred fewer dessert dishes and more attention to each plate. ",4
" We were greeted by every staff member with a warm welcome and a smile. Shown to a beautiful table over looking the park and presented a specially typed menu congratulating us on our recent engagement was a very beautiful touch.  The staff that looked after us were both very knowledgeable on all the food options and the techniques that go into making them. We chose the chefs tasting menu and we were floored with the amazing flavours, that were perfectly matched with all the components on the plate, well presented and the perfect sizing for each course. Just enough as to not fill up to early and we loved that the bread was served after a few courses so we didn't fill up on that first. The duck  was a highlight for me and well worth the supplement- I would have paid double that, my fiancé had the wagyu supplement for his main and was floored. He says the standard is set and it will take tough competition to even come close to overtaking this entire experience l.  The staff and their treatment of us literally left me with tears in my eyes and I could never recommend this place more. It was one of the most amazing experiences and I thank them so deeply for that! ",5
" Put simply, it is the best resturant I ever ate at.  Everything is perfect. ",5
 We did the Chef's Menu tonight and it was great!  All the staff were friendly from the moment we got in.  The hostess mentioned a special request I had for a table w a view and they delivered.  The food were superb.  Every dish and the wine brought to us were explained and that makes it more special.  Everyone was great and I am very appreciative for the anniversary card they all signed.  Thank you for a great experience!!  You guys are awesome and I'm recommending your restaurant to my friends ,5
" The ambiance and service are always impeccable, but it is really the chefs who seem to outdo themselves each time we visit. We recently enjoyed a citrus tasting menu that (once again) raised the bar for winter menus and the sommelier-paired wines were simply exquisite. ",5
 A unique citrus-themed dinner. The Yuzu dessert was probably my best dessert in the last 12 months. ,5
" Overall it was a very nice experience. The food creativity is really outstanding and the staff is fully educated on all aspects of the menu.  I have to say that it was a very good. However, the price will prevent multiple revisits.   In no way am I suggesting the restaurant change. I see and understand why things are priced the way they are. With that said repeat visits will be difficult and I do not see us returning soon ",4
" Great food, even better service but a bit overpriced ",4
" Fantastic. New Years Eve. Flawless service. Food very creative and imaginative, and beautiful quality. And quiet! It was a memorable evening. ",5
 Elements is by far the BEST restaurant I know of.  The food is absolutely fantastic. ,5
" The restaurants atmosphere is amazing. The food was delicious, creative, and original. We ate there for Christmas Eve and thanks to the team at elements we had a awesome time so thanks again! ",5
" We had the tasting menu on Christmas Eve and the 5 course meal with wine pairing was selected.  Two selected the regular wine pairing, two selected the premium. Only one or two selections for each course but every one was superb. The presentations were very inventive including quail eggs presented in a ""nest"" and a menu item with a shagbark hickory reduction presented on the wood. Not even one minor complaint about any of the items from any of the diners.  Dropped a star because at the end of the evening we were astonished not to be offered a coffee , the bill was dropped on the table with a comment that the service charge was included. No inquiry if we had enjoyed the evening.  It is a very expensive restaurant with food and wine to match, the service needs to measure up to that level. ",4
" It was okay. I was expecting something different. Give it a try, and judge for yourself. ",3
 The food didn't meet the expectation....the wine selections were excellent but the food didn't blow me away ,3
 We did the chef’s tasting menu and loved it. Very interesting combinations and presentations. Everything was outstanding. We will surely return. ,5
 Phenomenal!  The food was spectacular!  The service was impeccable!  The wines were perfect accompaniments to the menu selections!  We can’t wait to go back!!  Our compliments to the chefs and the sommelier!! ,5
 This place is fabulous from service to restaurant design to the food.  I am really impressed that an unpretentious fine dine dinning establishment of this caliber is in tiny Princeton.  As good as any top nyc foodie restaurant and i have been to them all and many around the globe.  The $100 tag for the 5 course is a bargain by comparison to other similar quality restaurants as is the chefs tasting menu.  Blissfully happy that Elements is in my town. ,5
" Spectacular.  Of course. I'd argue it's a veritable bargain in this way: it's such an exciting cross cultural dive in a 5 senses kind of way....thus way cheaper and easier than hopping on a plane or in a car for the weekend to have a hoped for thrilling new experience.  We're sophisticated foodies, and we kept exclaiming.  For a combo Christmas/birthday gift for all 5 of them, I'll send my 21 and 27 year old sons with their 15, 18, and 25 year old cousins here for dinner without the parents.  What an unforgettable experience for them to share together.  In the end, so worth the $100-$200 a head.  At first they'll be like ""wtf?"" and by the middle of the tasting menu they will totally get it and be in thrall.  I'm sure of it. ",5
 We were celebrating a birthday and had a wonderful night. Staff were attentive but not intrusive and food was outstanding (4 course menu). We chose the wine pairing which was an excellent add. Atmosphere was cozy and comfortable. Not inexpensive but well worth it! ,5
 Enjoyed their delicious and creative tasting menu!  Wine were spectacular and generous pour.   We had a memorable evening celebrating our son's 21st :) ,5
 This was my second visit to Elements and it did not disappoint. The special event Japanese seafood tasting menu was excellent! And I loved the sparkling apple cider they current have on the menu because it is so dry and sophisticated; perfect fit for the personality of the restaurant. ,5
 Food didn’t march up with the reporting. Too salty. Too earthy. Not enough variety in flavor profiles ,2
" Definitely a great experience... service was phenomenal, food was delicious and well presented, love the ambience and all the small details of the place.  Excellent! ",5
 We called to confirm if there was an Ala Carte menu and were told yes.  There wasn't.  We brought guests who were in from London and were embarrassed by the food portions and simply no menu choice.  The portions were extremely small and we all left hungry.  My wife had to give her meat portion to my son so that he ate something.  Service was good and the food was tasty but we spent a lot of money to leave hungry. ,2
" Food was a bit precious, but wine pairing and sommelier were fantastic. ",5
 Dinner for 4 and we did the chef's tasting menu with standard wine pairing. Every course great and the 3 off menu surprises from the chef all terrific. Service as good as it gets. Wines were unusual and perfect with every course. A true fine dining experience without any pretense or attitude ,5
" Amazing date night! The most unique and exciting meal I have ever had, that's for sure. Definitely going back - The sommelier seemed to have known me from another life - he was just spot on with the wine pairing! Love love love ",5
" Had an excellent experience at Elements. This was my first time dining there. It is very different to any restaurant in New Jersey in that the kitchen is a few feet away from where your standing, they forage for their own food, and, just like at Noma or some Michelin star places, the cooks serve the dish and explain it to you instead of servers which I loved and thought it was interesting and enjoyable. Flavors compared to other restaurants were very bizarre but still excellent. Service is pretty quick and attentive since it is a very small restaurant. Atmosphere and ambiance is nice except it can get a little dark which is a con for me since I like to see and take pictures of my food. One of the best restaurants in New Jersey I have tried so far though! ",5
" I went to Elements for my birthday. I had an amazing, full, and well rounded culinary experience! The food was very good and forced me to try new dishes I'd never thought to try. Very fun! ",5
" Absolutely top notch experience in every aspect.  They even presented us with a signed card for our anniversary.  Spectacular and exciting food prepared impeccably, phenomenal service, I can't say enough about Elements; it was an experience I will not soon forget. ",5
 Fantastic food with smaller portions but did not leave hungry. All restaurants should serve like that. The chefs brought out the food and the kitchen was visible from all seats. A marvelous experience. Just expect to pay for it ,5
" Our experience at Elements was fantastic. Not only was the food world class, but the service as phenomenal. We went for my girlfriend's birthday and the kitchen staff wrote and signed a card wishing her a happy birthday. Fantastic place, highly recommended. ",5
 Very unassuming  friendly restaurant with amazing food. The Maitake mushrooms were just out of this world and they had a great wine list. Even the wine by the glass was good. We were just in Princeton off chance and so happy we stumbled on this through the internet reviews. Pitty I can't get back there again soon. ,5
 Food and service was outstanding! Tasting menu is wonderful and they will happily at Later the menu to accommodate special diets such as in our case vegans. ,5
 Phenomenal. We made this reservation celebrating my moms life. It was extraordinary ,5
 Fantastic!  All the best! ,5
 Food and service is the best ever!!! From entrance to dining absolutely the best!! ,5
 A great experience every time. The food and the service are outstanding. They even sent us home with a onesie for our newborn and extra cookies for the other two. ,5
 Had wine pairing and was excellent. The scallop dish  with  stuffed. Holland eggplant  reminds me of Paris.  2009 Grable Vineyard Cab Sav  is to savor. Ending with Lauren-Perrier Rose’ was perfect! ,5
" I'm writing this review from heaven right now, because last night's dinner sent me there. Everything was absolutely perfect, from the service to the setting and the food. From the moment you walk through the door, everyone is extremely welcoming and kind. They were very accommodating to the person I was with, who doesn't eat seafood, and offered her different proteins for the two seafood dishes that were on the menu. I had the tasting of vegetables, which was absolutely amazing. I really recommend getting both menus so that you can share and taste every single dish - of course the menu changes daily but for us there were zero negatives. We visited for my birthday and they printed a birthday wish and my name on the menu! Afterwards the chef signed the menu and I got to take it home. We also got little stools each to put our bags on. Everything was so good - the beef was to die for, melted in your mouth and the potato agnolotti was just.. I can't even describe it. But honestly it's hard to choose a favorite when everything tastes the way it did. The desserts were amazing as well, they have different desserts for the chef's tasting and tasting of vegetables so again, recommend getting both menus if you don't mind sharing a little (or just keeping the veg option for yourself if you're not that big on meat). We were so full that we were offered to take the second round of desserts with us, which we of course did. I also got a little bag with more bonbons, caramel type things, macaroons, donuts, special Per Se birthday chocolate bars.. yes barS. Everyone was super kind and kept wishing me a happy birthday, from our server to other wait staff who changed the napkins, refilled the water, brought out the dishes and picked up the plates.. Just so many amazing things, I can go on and on and on. We don't drink alcohol so stuck to water, coke and tea, which was all free of charge. But you'll have to experience it for yourself. Go set your alarm clock and make that reservation! ",5
 Outstanding in every way! ,5
" Finding your Elements Located on the 2nd floor at 66 Witherspoon Street in the heart of charming Princeton, Elements provided us with a sense of a dinner as a wondrous gathering of people, the craft of cooking, superlative flavors and tasting menus of impeccable taste and elan.  Imagine soft-boiled quail eggs wrapped in leaves which have been gently smoked. Now add a glass of Domaine Daniel Dugois, a Chardonnay from Arbois France and the food and drink wonders commence. Worth every cent from a skilled team including all the chefs who quietly bring their dish to your table. Voilá and enjoy! ",5
" Difficult to find and at this level of fine dining, no table cloth is quite unusual.  Our waiter did not communicate well and several pieces of information he provided were inaccurate, e.g. when I asked for the menu of the evening, he explained that menu changed on a daily basis and he wouldn't know what would  be served.  Fair enough, I then asked for the menu to be printed at the end of the evening, which he agreed.  Barely five minutes later, an exquisitely printed and beautifully illustrated menu was given to us !  Eh?  They don't talk to each other?   As for the food, we pre-booked the grand tasting menu of nearly 20 courses .  Some worked better than the others, overall it's verged too much towards experimental and quite a hit-and-miss.  At this price level, I would expect something more sure-footed.    Restaurant was very empty on a Thursday evening in downtown Princeton.  We were the last table to finish and the sous-chefs did not hesitate to change into casual clothes before we had dessert and the waiters also closed shop early.  Main chef who served us did not show a smile all evening.  He looked tired and disinterested in serving us.  Not a good sign.   I won't return and if you have not tried, don't bother ",1
" From Hostess to Service to The Food, AMAZING! The Chefs Tasting menu was a lovely way to celebrate my husband's birthday.  Perfectly portioned to be able to enjoy each course without feeling uncomfortable afterward. The wine pairings were lovely and professionally presented. They add the gratuity for you which I appreciated, less math for me to do after enjoying my meal. The dining room is lovely, the music is kept low and unobtrusive, you can actually carry-on a conversation at your table. The open kitchen is incredibly fine tuned and Zen-like. I can't say enough good things about this experience. It's definitely in my top 5 tasting menus. ",5
 Had tasting menu-each course was mouthwatering ! ,5
 Food overall was great except for the wagyu that was prepared was a bit on the salty side. There were also a few dishes that were too salty. Excellent service for sure. Staff were very helpful and attentive.  Overall value for food is okay. ,3
" Good food, inventive menu. Attractive decor but stiff atmosphere. Server was not helpful or pleasant and, at times, verged on rude. There should be a better balance between superior food and commensurate service. Third time we have visited, consistently unimpressed by the service. ",3
" We attended the special BBQ dinner and all three of us agreed that it was among the best meals we've ever had in a Philadelphia area restaurant (none in our party reside in or near Princeton). To our surprise, the menu was actually more seafood-centric than meat driven. In fact, the only traditional BBQ'd meat was a wonderfully moist and flavorful piece of brisket. The sophistication of the menu and the artistic presentations were reminiscent of what you see in Barcelona. And at Elements, it's not just about the food. Whether you know a lot or really nothing about wine, the wine/beverage pairings offered are varied and very impressive in several contexts. Without exception, in our experience, the sommelier at Elements is the best of his profession in the Philadelphia region. Overall, Elements has evolved into one of the best restaurants in the country -- see for yourself! ",5
 We went there for my husbands birthday.  The food and service was outstanding.  If you are a foodie and enjoy sampling menu this is the place ,5
 What a fantastic experience!  The food and the wine were spectacular and the service was impeccable.   I highly recommend the chef's tasting menu. ,5
 Fantastic experience. Food was exceptional ,5
" Experienced 5 Michelin star restaurants on our trip, including Luger's, Bernardin, Madison Park, Babbo. Out of the 5, if I could only choose one for a 2nd visit, Momofuku Ko would be it. Open kitchen surrounded by counter seating for the patrons. Every one of the 14 courses was delicious, but still craving for more of the soft boiled egg potato chips with caviar. A fabulous experience in a casual, friendly atmosphere.  By the way, this place is literally in an alley. A safe alley right off a busy street, but still an alley.   I actually called before getting out of the cab to confirm we were at the right location. Upon approaching a glass door with a nondescript sign, a young lady came out from what I think is their office, and directed us to the entrance next door. It speaks volumes they can fill the place and reservations are almost impossible to get. ",5
 Amazing! The best dinner experience I have ever had.  Will go back soon. ,5
 We loved it. Ko exceeded all of our expectations. ,5
 A wonderful experience with a well trained staff. I hope i am able to return ,5
 I couldn't have been happier with the quality of service and the food. The food was both top quality and interesting. The staff and atmosphere were extraordinary from the moment we walked in the door until we exited. Everything was perfect and it was pure deliciousness from every angle. ,5
 Epic!... hands down one of my most memorable dinning experiences... and I have eaten at an obscured number of Michelin three-star restaurants around  the world ,5
 Amazing food. Innovative. ,5
" Amazing restaurant. The food is exceptional, the service is also particularly nice, efficient and non-disturbing at all. In addition, seeing the chefs cook from the counter is a very nice experience and all the chefs are very nice to talk to once their service is finished. Last they also accommodated our requests (my wife was pregnant) very thoughtfully. I'd recommend it to anyone without a doubt. ",5
 Great service and the food was amazing. Menu was extremely varied and creative! Intimate experience with a very fun vibe. ,5
 outstanding dining experience. great team. food was amazing! thx! ,5
 one of the most amazing meals in recent memory - completely original and cutting edge ,5
 Took my boyfriend here for his birthday dinner and we were absolutely thrilled.  The staff &amp; service were incredible.  The food was creative and varied.  Would definitely highly recommend. ,5
 Food is good but not great for the high prices. We have dined here before and will come back again. ,3
" It was my first visit but won't be my last!  The menu caters to every possible dietary restriction which was perfect for our group--delicious vegan options, gluten-free options and plenty of regular food for the rest of the group.  The service could not have been better! ",4
 Great spot - owners always there - food is hot and fresh - a Italian favorite of my family ,5
" I cannot say enough about this place! Our waiter Brad was unbelievable! When our friend wanted a particular drink that they didn't carry he went next door and bought a small bottle so they could make it for him! Our appetizers were delicious ( eggplant rollatini ,clams oreganata) wonderful huge salads that my friend and I split. We were getting full so one friend and I split the lobster risotto with lobster tail. They split the dish with no complaints.  It was probably the best meal I ever had. Rissoto cooked perfectly and lobster was tender and sweet. The hostess and her husband were extremely friendly and engaging. This is a gem! ",5
 This is the best Italian I have had in Saratoga the food is creative and tastes amazing . The service we had was second to none . Well worth trying every meal was amazing . ,5
 Very good food and service.  Highly recommend. ,5
 our hostess was so professional and accommodating. ,5
 The food and service were excellent. Would highly recommend. ,5
" Our go-to spot for great food and wine, friendly servers and bartender, love Terry! And easy parking! ",5
" Excellent service, great food! Creative specials!  I love the chicken dishes. Best eggplant! ",5
" It was our first visit to this restaurant. Our server was attentive, friendly and let us know that the meatballs were their specialty. The caprese salad was meh. Our main pasta courses were good. We will be back. ",5
" Love, love, love the variety of meatballs! Salads are always fresh; service is great and I feel very at home there. ",5
 Everything was enjoyable especially the waitress. She was very attentive but not annoying.  The owners are very friendly. I would highly recommend. ,5
 Our server was excellent and food ingredients first class. Reasonable prices and spot on recommendations make 3 Vines a winner. ,4
" Don’t let the strip mall location deter you.   Once inside you are transported to a lively warm place to eat. It’s casual and a little bit noisy. Based on former reviews we tried two of the meatballs as appetizers.    We liked the sausage and broccoli Rabe one but thought the chicken marsala meatball was a bit bland.   There were three of us and we then shared a salad, a white pizza, and the chicken Sorrento. The food was excellent especially the chicken Sorrento cooked in a marsala red tomato sauce.  I would recommend thr restaurant and would return again. ",4
" tables to small,food to expensive,service to slow  over all it SUCKED!!! ",1
" Food was delicious and hot! Music was too loud. We asked if it could be turned down and the waiter said of course, but we didn’t notice a difference. ",4
 It took me years to get there for dinner after many people raved about this place. Wow! It was awesome and for a place known for its meatballs.. they even offered a vegetarian one! I will be back for sure! ,5
 We had a reservation yet they were confused about where to put our party of 5 and mentioned we were early when we weren’t.  Just found out this morning that they messed up my husband’s dinner - they gave it to someone else and offered a different meal to him. This was whispered to him by the waiter. Instead of holding up everyone’s dinner he accepted what the other person ordered but it wasn’t what he wanted. Completely unacceptable. My sausage meatball was hard and not tasty. We were very disappointed with our experience and will probably not go back. Sorry I️ hate giving bad reviews. ,2
 The dinner choices  are  fresh and delicious. Our waitress is the best! She was very attentive and knowledgable about all the menu selections.  We will definitely go there again! ,5
 Not impressed!  Forno Bistro is much better for the money. ,3
" Sat 11/4 was our first time there.  The waiter (Nick) was exceptional and took great care of us.  I tend to judge Italian restaurants based on their Veal Parm.  Extremely generous portion and the best I've had in awhile. My wife had the Linguini with White Clam sauce, it was very good as well. Will definitely plan to return soon when in Saratoga Springs next. ",5
" Pleasant surprise.  Mike G was awesome, the food very tasty and very reasonable   Can’t wait to return ",5
 Both the food and service were excellent. You can tell they prepare everything from scratch and with the freshest ingredients.  Highly recommended! ,5
 Food was very good and the service was great.  Would definitely recommend to friends and will come back. Loved all of the options available for the pasta! ,4
 Always have good + sometimes excellent dinners here. Last Sunday the grappa lobster was decent but pasta was overcooked + the sauce needed something - I added crushed pepper. The lobster + shrimp were delicious. ,4
" Located in a strip mall, Three Vines is an unpretentious but very good restaurant, offering perfectly good baseline Italian food and more, with attentive, friendly service and decent wines at a fair price.  The flat panel TVs are not blaring or intrusive, so if you're not interested in what's on (mostly sports) don't watch.  As to the food, the ""meet"" balls were very tasty and certainly worth getting an assortment.  The chicken sorrentino was nicely prepared and the pasta was just the right texture.   We went on a Saturday night and had no problem getting a reservation at the time we wanted, were seated and served promptly and generally had a great time. ",4
 Very good. Enjoyed dinner very much. The eggplant rolatini was excellent. ,5
 Very enjoyable.  Good food. Excellent service. ,5
 Great MEETBALLS. Yes that is with two EE's . They come in all different flavors. Chicken and Meat. Great little place for a night out. ,5
 The service was great the food was great. We have been here several times and it always is a hit. I think the friendly atmosphere is a big part of why we like this restaurant. We will definitely come back time and again. ,5
" We enjoyed Three Vines very much.  We were seated immediately upon entering.  Our waiter was David, who provided excellent service.  The food was wonderful -- more than we could eat, so it made a great doggy bag and dinner for the next night!  The chocolate lava cake for dessert was great.  All in all a lovely evening -- we will certainly be back! ",4
 Absolutely love this place! Great Italian cuisine. We always visit when we're in Saratoga for the races! ,5
 Food was god and they have a wood burning oven. Pizza was cooked very well. I would go back when I am in the area. Give it a try!!! ,4
" Excellent Italian cuisine, with fine service.  The Osso Bucco with polenta is outstanding. ",5
" The meatballs are fantastic. Great variety and all good but especially the veal, buffalo chicken and sausage and peppers were great. Meet lovers and eggplant pizzas were very tasty. Very homey and comfortable. Great for a hearty casual meal ",4
 Suprisingly good food - good hearty Italian dishes. ,4
 The food is always delicious. We have been going there for over 3 years and every meal was excellent. ,5
" Good service, reasonable food and wine. Kinda of noisy and sat at a table of 6 for two. Would go back ",5
" David our waiter was exceptional, he was great, the food was the best Italian food I have had in Saratoga. Will recommend it to all my friends ",5
 Waiter was amazing food was excellent ,5
" We went in blind and sort of missed the $195 set menu plus tax and plus service thing. It left a rather giant lump in the throat the days leading to the meal but it disappeared once we entered the door off Extra St (so extra). This place could have been the most pretentious place in Manhattan, however the staff feel relaxed, punky music plays as you sit down in the most comfortable seats known to the human behind. The chefs, all smiling before you are busy preparing you insane delights. Ko's site said 12-15 dishes, maybe we were just lucky but we got 19 dishes including a little secret something to take away. We were politely full by the end. Not too much, not too little. Go for the earliest slot possible else you might have your entire meal ruined by seeing other people's meals sitting across from you.  It was expensive as hell, but you know what, every penny was worth it. ",5
" Our waiter was very attentive while we were able to take our time with our meal. We enjoyed the fish tacos, club sandwich and Cesar salad. ",4
" I'd surely recommend this place for party of two...who can sit up front by the windows. We were a party of 3 and I didn't really enjoy the ambiance. We were seated right near the kitchen door. There was plenty of space elsewhere ...but, we didn't ask to sit in a cuter place. We were famished! Punch is cute but it really needs to rethink its seating plans. It's too tacky to have tables by the kitchen door, in my opinion. ",4
" Dinner was great. Everything tastes fresh and was perfectly seasoned. We was served by Rebecca who was nice, but a little pushy towards the end because we were her last patrons of her shift.   I would definitely return here. ",4
" We arrived early for our reservation and they were happy to seat us. Very attentive, but we never felt rushed and were able to enjoy their bottomless brunch. Great value and the staff was extreamly kind. ",5
" I always have a great time here, and the new menu is superb ",5
 It had been a while since I’ve been there and the food seems to have slid. Menu seems at once different at very old. ,2
" Even though there were very few customers, we waited about 35 minutes for our food. ",3
" Punch has been around for quite a while and is one of the great mainstays of the Gramercy/Flatiron area. Always reliable, always good, I always enjoy going there. And I dined at Punch on a Monday night so the noise level was low. ",4
 The restaurant was not as advertised. I expected a chef driven menu (Shoemaker) and a trendy interior. It was a sports bar with TVs everywhere and a laminated menu card.  The guacamole was good but nothing else. ,1
 Moderate weekend brunch (early afternoon) crowd.  DJ music was very loud.  Lots of sports on the many TV's.  Service was decently attentive and the bartender waiting on us at a table from behind the bar got my order wrong.  Food was good though as were the brunch cocktails.  $34 brunch (choose any entrée and unlimited brunch cocktails for 90 minutes) is a really good value if you plan on having a couple of drinks or more. ,3
 Service was terrible. They forgot about our order and had to comp us two glasses of wine. ,2
 I used to love this place.  The food was good and it was reasonably priced and a pleasant room.  I hadn't been there in a while and it's changed quite a bit.  There are big TV screens all around now and the menu is a single laminated sheet.  Feels more like a sports bar.  Seemed less clean and more run down.  Service was not great.  I won't be going back. ,1
 The staff wasn't quite available.  So you spend a great deal of time waiting to order.. waiting to be served... waiting to make request... waiting for the check... They also served me spoiled milk with my coffee...  The DJ for Brunch was awesome.. ,2
" Punch is a good neighborhood bar with reasonably priced food and drinks.   Although it's much more a sports bar (with a dozen tv's with soccer playing) than a restaurant, we were pleasantly surprised.   Our waiter (Hilario) was attentive and efficient and we had a Cobb salad and grilled chicken on a bed of risotto - both were delicious.   Certainly nothing fancy but a great place for a drink and a bite to eat.   We'll go again. ",4
" Punch was great the last two times I went, a long time ago.  This is the first time I've been to Punch in a very long time, and it will be the last.  Besides it being empty at lunch time with TVs on everywhere, the food was terrible.  The Mediterranean Plate was weak and uninspired,  the hummus thin and tasteless, the lentils dry and old looking, there was tortilla chips, why? And most of these chips were cracked pieces,  why bother.  The pita was warm and nice, and too few. Cobb Salad had a very few pieces of romaine and an over abundance of some bitter twiggy green.  I should have asked what it was because i just looked through countess googles images and couldn't find it.  There was barely any blue cheese so I asked for more and that helped cut the bitterness.  The best part of the meal was desert, scoop each of black cherry sorbet, vanilla bean, salty caramel ice cream -these were delicious.  Our waitress was fine.  I don't understand what happened to this place.  It made me sad and I will never go back.  Luckily my client picked the place otherwise I would have been very embarrassed. ",3
" Good food, ok prices for NY, but terrible acoustics and waiter not around after food served ",4
" This is a very average restaurant, the only good thing was that it could accommodate a  large group on short notice. ",3
 I had to have an impromptu meeting.  The reservation went from 2-5 people at 4 in the afternoon and the ordering was minimal but they could not have been nicer and what we had was great.  I definitely am going back for the full deal. ,5
 Went there for a group brunch. Food was good. Service was okay. Waiter seemed slightly unamused by us but was helpful with whatever we asked for. Even split the check individually for us. ,4
 Went for a late lunch for a co-worker's birthday. We both had pasta dishes. My mushroom ravioli was the perfect size. It was delicious. My co-worker enjoy the pappardelle with a glass of Malbec. It​ met his expectations. The service was good- not hurried or too slow. All in all it was a good experience. ,5
 Went with party of 7. Very accommodating as we had an earlier reservation but didn't end up sitting at table for at least an hour later than reservation time. Good service with attentive wait staff. Good food. Would recommend! ,5
" Horrible service. The restaurant was not air conditioned on a 90 degree evening and we couldn't wait to get out of there. We asked several times if they can put the AC on but they said it is on but since the doors were open in front, it is affecting the AC. Well, for the sale of everyone else in the restaurant, except for the ONE table by the open door, close the door and regulate the AC.  Cheese plate was $16 and was 1 small slice of each cheese that they cut from a block from the supermarket.  Entrees were just ok. ",2
 Went to Punch for Mothers Day brunch. It was a wonderful time with fantastic food and drinks. Relaxing and non-rushed atmosphere. I would definitely go here again when in this area of Manhattan. ,5
 Had a great time at brunch here!! The drink special is fantastic! The food is good too. We had a few extra guests and the restaurant was very accommodating. Would definitely come here again. ,4
" I just love coming here. I think it's the best brunch spot around. $35 bottomless brunch and the options are great! The staff is always amazing, food is always great. Music is always fun! Honestly, out don't get the pretentious brunch crowd and it's laid back but you still have amazing food! Can't recommend it enough!! ",5
 I wanted to go somewhere for a decently priced bottomless brunch in the city - and this was it! I enjoyed the variety of brunch options. The drinks had a punch (see what I did there?!) and the ambiance was lively without being fratty. I would return. ,4
 Lovely.   The only drawback were the television screens in the dining room.  It's distracting and stupid.  It's a shame because the food was fabulous and the service was impeccable. ,5
 Great experience this we had at Punch the food was awesome and the bottomless brunch was amazing. Good service I would definitely go again ,5
 Always amazing! Perfect for big groups. We have taken our family there every time they come to town; 4-10 people each time for Sunday Brunch and we have never had an issue once! Love love love it there!! ,5
" Good local restaurant for brunch.  Eggs came out hot and just the way I ordered them.  A little crowded for seating, but good Flatiron district restaurant. ",4
" Wonderful place for reunion lunch - relaxing and cosy atmosphere. Great service, delicious food. Austrian friends impressed by beer options! ",5
" Under new management since I was there last.  The food was very good, well prepared, well seasoned  and well presented.    The space was loud with 5 sports centered televisions surrounding the dining area.  We found it oppressive and not enjoyable.  I understand they want to position this as a sports oriented pub, but maybe they turn off the televisions on the weekends for the people who want dinner and not just drinks. ",3
" In overall the restaurant is excellent, the food is amazing, the kitchen staff super friendly and nice. The only thing that I would change is the music. ",5
 It was a wonderful experience! I will definately recomend to my closest friends! Thank you ,5
" Everything we expected and more. Just when you think a given course was the best thing you ate, they blow your mind with the next course ",5
 Food was not bad. However I got sick afterwards; could have been the duck which I overate. ,2
" Outstanding restaurant by David Chang in the East Village ! Get a seat at the Counter and enjoy the show. The only thing which could be considered as disappointed is the value, not as good as everything else. ",5
" incredible meal, pricey but worth every penny.  Service &amp; Food our outstanding.  A great night out. ",5
 It's the best ,5
" The taste is like roller coaster. There are courses that are so good and outstanding, but there are some tasted at an average line.   The most surprise thing is that they offer 18 courses for the tasting menu. I believe that is also why there are differences in the taste.   However. I still give 5 star because of several outstanding courses. ",5
 Food and drink very mediocre for the price. Terrible value. Price point was extremely off.  Dessert however was very good. Would not recommend and I’m a big fan of David Chang. ,2
 Thank you guys so much for having us! It was a real pleasure to come and dine! Everything was absolutely delicious! Your meat section was especially impressive... the duck and the beef were outstanding! Hope you have an amazing year and all the best for 2018 ,5
" Food was really disappointing, nothing outstanding. ",1
 Superb service and gracious staff. Food was brilliant. Made creative alternatives addressing my food allergies. Really went out of their way. ,5
 Amazing food! We go back every year and have a wonderful time every timr ,5
" A fantastic experience, multi faceted in terms of taste, texture and service and can even be a little overwhelming at first. Try to isolate a single element, or dish, or wine as the standout and I reckon you're missing the trick, it's the way they come together in front of you as your evening unfolds that's where the real magic lies. Would definitely go back! ",5
 Excellent service and food was phenomenal. ,5
 Amazing! Highly recommended. The staff is súper friendly and the food was just amazing!!! ,5
 This is what I expected from a Michelin two star. Dinner tasting menu is definitely one of the best in town. ,5
" absolutely delicious! Well thought tasting menu, courses were very consistent through out the 2.5hr dinner! Love the wine list as well. Services was outstanding as well. ",5
 Houston was great and the service generally was impeccable. ,5
 Service and food quality at its finest ,5
 Must try.. great flavor and creativity. The staff's are SUPER NICE!  Recommend the counter seating to get the experience of watching them prepare all the dishes. ,5
" One of the best meals I've ever had. Everything was creative and delicious. The dinner was paced really well and each course flowed into the next nicely. My girlfriend and I don't always like ""fine dining"" type experiences, but this was very low-key in that regard. Definitely not pretentious or snooty in any way. The staff was amazing. They did not hover over us, but as soon as either of us were done with our course or our drink, someone was there to take away the plate or ask if we wanted another drink. They weren't hovering but they were clearly paying very close attention.  I would highly recommend Ko. ",5
 Wonderful experience.  Can’t wait to go back! ,5
 Excellent！I enjoyed the whole meals and I can‘t love more. Each dish was charming and delicious，and the service was great！Plan your trip to momofuku ko，I promise you will never be disappointed！ ,5
 Culinary indulgence with attention to detail and uber creative. ,5
 This was my second time dining at the new location and it keeps getting better.  The creativity and presentation were amazing and the staff was outstanding. ,5
" Our experience was what I would call “the modern, reinvented fine dining of NYC”. Unique and authentic in all details.  Thank you! ",5
" Sit back, relax, make a friend, enjoy the journey! ",5
 This place left me speechless. David Chang is more then a chef. ,5
" FABULOUS CREATIVE DINING EXPERIENCE!  AN EVENING OF SUCH FINE FOOD AND SERVICE THAT ANYONE WHO TRUELY APPRECIATES FINE FOOD AND EXCEPTIONAL SERVICE SHOULDNOT MISS. ALTHOUGH OBVIOUSLY HIGH PRICED, IT WAS WORTH EVERY ONE OF MY HARD EARNED DOLLARS. YOU WILL NOT FIND THIS ANYWHERE ELSE BUT AT DAVID CHANG'S HANDS ( and mind)! ",5
" Fourth time here (3 at this location, 1 at the original), and our meals have been flawless and special each time. I gave it only a ""good"" for value simply because this is not where anyone should go if they're looking for a deal. This is a sexy restaurant with innovative and sexy tasting menu and wine pairing that's perfect for adventurous and discriminating eaters celebrating a special occasion. The Momofuku franchise has plenty of other great budget-friendly options if that's what one is looking for. ",5
" The food here is interesting. Like nothing else. Despite there only being 20 or so seats, there's no starting time for meals and so it's somewhat strange with people coming and going. ",4
" The food was excellent, the service was on point - they were on top of everything without being annoying. The only comment I have is some dishes seem out of season (chilled soup and ice cream in December?). ",4
 Everything was very good. The food was amazing and very innovative. The only thing I didn’t like were two staff members who gave a pretencious  vibe to the place while the others were attentive and very nice. It was just a huge contrast. The place is expensive but for a special occasion is the perfect place to go! ,5
" It was our anniversary so we treated ourselves to the drinks pairing menu, was great not to have to think about what wine to order when you don’t know the food menu ahead but the number of drinks were too many for me, especially with the smaller starter portions. Food was lovely &amp; the experience of sitting around the prep area with the chefs explaining each course was wonderful. The chefs are great fun &amp; happy to engage with you. Just wish we’d booked earlier so we could’ve started our meal before 9.30pm, finishing 13 courses at 1am was a lot!  Defo worth it ",5
" Creative food, good service. My only wish was that there were more vegetable dishes and more hot dishes. Felt that most of the dishes were on the room temp or cold. But I am just nitpicking. Great restaurant and good food. ",4
" Too expensive, not the best Michelin ",3
" Truly splendid and top notch!  Prefer this meal over that of Blanca, which was somewhat spotty. ",5
 Great experience. Some plates are magnifique.. but not all. ,5
 This is a new Punch &amp; not what we all expected nor as wonderful as it used to be. Now it looks  like a sports bar w/ TV's all over the place. The noise level was also extremely loud so that our group (college friends from the 60's) had a hard time hearing one another. The waiters were very accommodating and tried to help as much as possible. ,4
" The food was good, the drinks were good, the service by our waiter was very poor. It appeared he was having a serious problem managing all his tables, so we started flagging down other employees so we would not wait 15 minutes for ordering another round of drinks - specifically a very nice and young lady who was very accommodating. Due to the experience I cannot give more than two stars, but with that said if  we would of had great service would have marked 4 stars. ",2
 Good deals for special events! ,4
" Went for brunch at 1  on Saturday.  Varied small menu. Ordered eggs, sausage and 'cheddar' grits. Nice presentation, food was hot.  Nothing special.  Not one ounce of cheddar in grits.  Service fair.  Perhaps because we were not drinking or partaking in bottomless brunch.  Ok meal.  Way too many other better options around. ",2
" Was essentially empty on a Sunday at 11 AM.  We were the only party that arrived for the entire duration of our reservation which was from 11 AM - 12:15 PM.  Service was great, prices were fair.  Food was OK - don't think I'd return but would recommend for large groups or a place for a brunch if you are in need of a reservation for a large group. ",3
" I'm glad I finally made it to Punch. Service was very attentive, and my beer battered fish and chips were very yummy...especially with a frosty beer! My friend had the short rib sandwich which she proclaimed very good. Vibe is energetic and lots of big screen TV's on the walls. ",4
 I haven't ever had a bad experience here which is the reason I keep going back however I do feel today wasn't great. I felt like my server forgot my table was there and I didn't feel like we were being attended to due to there being larger tables. I won't let this one experience change my mind however I do think the servers need to focus on all tables and not the larger one. ,3
" Always cordial service with a feeling like you're in Spain. Wonderful tapas options. Delicious goat cheese, grilled calamari. For main course we had seafood paella... tasted as good as it looked. We all enjoyed as we have in prior visits. I highly recommend! ",4
" Came in for lunch with a discerning friend.  We were both pleased by the quality and flavor of our main courses--and the value.  Because we were short of time, we couldn't order the more elaborate dishes.  Even so, our first experience was so good that we are looking forward to returning with high expectations.  (Also appreciated the courteous and attentive wait-staff.) ",4
" Excellent Food, friendly service. We love Sala. The Mon flamenco show is excellent. ",5
 Fried goat cheese was delicious but paella wasn’t very crispy ,4
" We attended Sala One Nine for my husband's birthday, and our dinner was fabulous! Last spring we travelled to Madrid, where we fell in love with the food. We wanted to find an authentic Spanish dinner to recapture our trip, and Sala One Nine delivered. The roasted lamb and rabbit were superb, the sangria was spot on, and the service was top notch. The host remembered all the details and made sure we received their best service. The Iberian ham brought us right back to Madrid. Thank you Sala One Nine! ",5
 Love this place! ,5
 Kitchen was closed because of a mysterious issue - but the sign outside said lunch was being served. It was weird. ,1
" Food at Sala One Nine was delicious, as always. Great restaurant and fun to bring friends to share/try all the dishes! ",5
" Absolute perfection, from start to finish. Celebrated a milestone birthday and enjoyed every minute (and bite!) The most authentic Spanish experience I've had since returning from a trip to Spain. Charming, cozy interior, delicious wines &amp; food, friendly service...cannot recommend this place highly enough. Definitely get the scallops, goat cheese, croquetas, and most heavenly flan ever! ",5
" Great sangria, atmosphere, bread and fried goat cheese. Seafood paella was okay. Wasn’t crispy enough and thought the seafood tasted a little fishy. ",4
 The management was very accommodating to our large party. Waiter was great and efficient and as always the food was beyond delicious! Superb spot for a great night out! ,5
" fabulous welcome, fantastic food, would eat there every week if we could! ",5
" Sala One Nine gave us a lovely night out to listen to some excellent Flamenco guitar, song and dance.  The tapas were tasty and delivered to our table at a reasonable rate so we could enjoy them without being buried in choices or left sitting waiting for another course.  The service was attentive and professional.  Overall - the tapas were authentic and very good, but nothing really shined out in the cooking.  However, the overall combination of food and music were a great way to spend an evening meal. ",4
" Its my second time here. I enjoy coming in Monday evening, when there is live flamenco singing and dancing.. We ordered small plates: croquets, shrimp, Chorizo, brussel sprouts. Everything was tasty. My friend is very particular about Spanish food, and he enjoyed all of it.  The flamenco performance was amazing. Its a thrill to see the performers up close. The staff is very welcoming and the place has a nice atmosphere. Just one suggestion: the amplification of the music is way too loud. ",5
 Great food and top notch Sangria! ,5
" Tables too crowded, very noisy.  I would not go back ",3
" Great date night location - good wine and ambiance. We only had one tapa each and mostly drank. I had the fried goat cheese, which is the reason I come back here over n over. Only thing is pricing is on the higher end - goat cheese was about $15, which is a little too overpriced. Our bill for a bottle of wine and two tapas was $70. ",4
" The restaurant had not received our reservation but was very accommodating. The food was AMAZIMG!! We ordered a rice dish with ribs, pork belly and sausage. Although it was not paella, the chef prepared it with a crunchy layer of rice on the bottom. We will definitely go back. I was in Spain this summer and this restaurant is the real deal. ",5
" Great place, food was really tasty and service was good.  Wine selection really nice and live music was amazing!  A little loud and little expensive, but such is the nature of tapas.  Highly recommended. ",4
" -good food but service was lacking (no one really came over to take our order, give us the check, etc.)  -live music, nice but loud  -good food ",3
" As always, a great time with great food and ambiance.  Our waiter was fantastic!!! ",5
" We met clients at the restaurant and had great food and a great time. The restaurant was a little noisy for business, but to be expected. Service was impeccable. ",5
" This is the second time we have gone to this restaurant specifically for the Monday night Flamenco Show. Great food, for a great value! Highly recommend.  First time I was on a date and the second time we went with my parents. ",5
" Not sure what the scheduling of staff was like but it was a very busy lunch time and there was only one waiter waiting all the tables. I don't blame the guy for being slow in pace but hopefully it's not like this often. Poor guy was the bartender at the bar for about 20 minutes, then back to waiting and then gone for a while to take other kinds of orders. A few tables including myself had to walk to where he was to ask for the check and pay. ",3
" Sala19 was great! The tapas were delicious and priced reasonably.  Very loud ambiance, but great for a Friday or Saturday night out. ",5
" Love this place! Authentic food, great service! The host was very accommodating and they have great food options. Always will choose this place over the competitor down the block!! ",5
" Good food. Nice service. They used to have more tapas options, like cheese croquettes, padrones, and artichoke hearts.   It's also just way too loud. ",4
" Everything wonderful and delicious--only problem is the full-saturation noise level. Great room, fun and food, but only shouted conversation possible. But can't wait to go back! ",5
 Great food and great service. ,5
" Delicious Tapas in a trendy setting. The small plates were delicious, and the wine was a perfect pairing. Will definitely be back. ",4
" This is our favorite tapas place! The food is excellent, fresh from the grill. Service was extremely efficient so dishes were served nice and warm. The place is very busy so it’s best to make a reservation. Lots of atmosphere, friendly waiters / waitress! ",5
" Absolutely loved the decor and ambiance. The muted colors, darkened interiors with funky light - it was a cute place. The wine selection and drink menu was sizable and the wine was good. Prices were on par for the area. We decided to get different tapas to share. The tortilla espanola was delicious-just the way it should be. The goat cheese was creamy and paired well with softly roasted beets. The shrimp in garlic sauce were tasty albeit spicy. The patatas bravas were mediocre -too much spice but not roasted enough. Also, the octopus was forgettable - swimming in oil and and not to our liking. Overall it was a pleasant evening and service was good but I wish the food was better. ",3
 Delicious food; everything piping hot. Great service. Very loud - a little too loud to carry on a conversation ,5
 The food was amazing and every staff member friendly and accommodating.  Will definitely return! ,5
" Took a friend for her bitthday, based on a recommendation. The noise level was so high, even far away from the bar, that I had to yell to have a conversation. Bad choice for early on a Friday evening. ",2
" Great service and delicious food! It's a little noisy, but you feel like you are at a tapas bar in Spain. Our go-to order is the bacon-wrapped dates with marcona almonds. ",5
 Sala One Nine never disappoints!  Everything I have ever eaten there has been delicious and the service is impeccable!  I have been there many times with friends and I will definitely be back for more! ,5
 Traditional tapas. Lively atmosphere. Attentive service. ,4
" We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner! The bacon-wrapped dates, meatballs, and fried goat cheese were to die for. ",5
" A nice laid back spot when I have been there--most recently noon on a Sat --got off to a slow start on service but perhaps it was the hour, and it was great after that. Croquetas are wonderful. ",4
 We had brunch to celebrate my Dad’s 82nd birthday. Our party also had a 1-year old. Our server was fantastic- very attentive  and friendly without being intrusive.  The food was absolutely delicious and the ambiance was great! We will absolutely go back. ,5
 Great Cocktails! And a very good beer selection..food was good also ,4
" We had a great dinner. The restaurant wasn’t busy so our server had a lot more time. She was so nice, gave us good food &amp; wine &amp; beer suggestions.  Service was exceptional. The food was presented very nicely &amp; was delicious. ",5
" Delicious brunch with an old friend. Really well done food (scrambled eggs with lobster [!] done perfectly) and delicious cocktails (something with tequila, coffee liquor and cream).  We really enjoyed! ",5
 Food was good and very tasty.  Had a really good drink menu with lots of wine and whiskey options.  Service was a bit slow and wait staff seems overwhelmed.  Still very good and will go back. ,4
 I really really like the ease of using Open Table for reservations. This was my second visit to Cross and Orange - we enjoyed the first visit so much we returned the following weekend. The server was really overwhelmed and busy. He tried so I can’t really be upset with him- the wait staff seemed understaffed. Food was great! Love the wings and that 60/40 burger is like nothing I’ve ever had!! ,4
 We really enjoyed Cross and Orange. Service was great...we loved the food-the atmosphere. Wings were excellent- the bill arriving in a beaten up book which you can sign the pages was a really homey touch ....we could have done without the truffle popcorn as we prefer bread - other than that we can’t wait to come back ,4
 Have been a huge fan of Cross and Orange until this visit. While the new chef originally showed great promise - the changes to the menu now - eliminating corn tortillas from their tacos was HUGELY disappointing. Being Gluten sensitive I’ve always enjoyed this for years - and they’ve now eliminated that - along with other gluten friendly dishes. To add insult to injury their new wine pour was about 5 oz - if that. When I questioned the lighter pour - the server was quite flip about it. Will be a long time before I come back - and I’m a resident of Asbury Park. Very sad. ,2
 The table service was slow. It wasn't busy and still took 30 minutes to get a drink. The food was average at best. ,2
 Have been here a couple times. Lovely atmosphere and excellent service! ,5
 Good experience overall. Will go back ,4
 Had my reservations in and was seated right away. Great handcrafted cocktails and they give you popcorn to much on. Not just any popcorn. It was delicious! We had appetizers dinner and dessert. We both cleaned our plates off.  Great experience! Thank you. ,5
" Fun, tasty,wide variety.  Definitely coming back. ",5
" This past Saturday evening, my husband and I doubled dated with a couple who were are good friends with. We had a very nice time. Food was great, cocktails were fantastic and the flight of wines is definitely worth it. Service was great too! Food does take a little bit of time to come out (so not a good place if you are in a hurry) and the portion sizes are a little smaller than some other restaurants but again, we all loved our food. I had a butternut squash special, my friend had the quinoa bowl with chicken and the two men had the 60/40 burger (which they raved about). Good ambience and decor. We found it quite surprising that the place was only half full at 8pm on a Saturday night. I don’t really know why this place has such mixed reviews (besides maybe the portion sizes but let’s face it, do we really need gigantic portions?), we all loved it and will definitely return! ",5
 Food was good as well as the service. Looking forward to coming back. ,4
 It was amazing!! It was so good and everyone enjoyed their mea!! ,5
 The sea bass was more like black bass and really fishy. The pork shank wasn't good either. ,2
" Service was extremely slow. meal for 2 was 1 45 min and we asked for the dessert and check to come out quickly.  Appetizer sent back as scallops were not fully cooked and cool in the translucent center.  Wife ordered medium steak and it came rare and bloody throughout center, we sent it back and ends were cooked medium but center still rare and inedible.  Staff had not been trained in dealing with these types of issues (no compensation of any sort, no true remorse). No manager visible. ",1
 Service was great. The onion soup was the best part of the meal. Pasta dish and waffle dessert were good but nothing special. Restaurant was loud. Not sure if I would go back again. ,3
 Overall the food was good for most entrees ordered. However The sea bass was small on portion and the potatoes had no seasoning at all. Appetizers were tasty. Best course was the dessert. The flourless chocolate tort was heaven. There seems to be a consistency issue with their food overall. ,4
" Two for one Tuesday Burger Night is a hit!  And we loved that the gratuity was included on the final bill.  Enormous burgers delivered piping hot to the table.  We enjoyed the Jersey Burger (protein galore) and the Aloha Burger.  Pork carnitas were a delicious start with drinks. Great menu, wonderful people, lively atmosphere in Asbury. ",5
" Excellent cocktails and a great meal - interesting ingredients and presentation. Even off-season on a slow Saturday night, it was a great casual dining experience and we will be back. ",5
 Birthday  dinner was great. Deanna was a great server. New menu was on mark. Fried Chicken was outrageous ,5
" This was the first time at Cross and Orange. We we're great by very nice hosts. We decided to have a drink at the bar first  The selections at the bar were great, the bartenders were pleasant and attentive.  We move to our table and our waitress was very nice.  She was also attentive.  The food was awesome, delicious combinations of freshly made food. Nice place, great food, great staff, great ambiance. ",5
" Another fantastic meal at Cross &amp; Orange.  I had the ""Call me old fashioned"" cocktail. They serve it in a little glass flask - so cool and really really good!  My girlfriend had the Tequila Mockingbird, also delicious!  For dinner we had scallops over butternut squash risotto, and hanger steak with truffle fries.  The scallops were huge and the steak was so tender.  Our server Julio was on point.  Really great experience! ",5
 Great food and service.  Noise level was uncomfortable ,5
" Service and food was wonderful.  Our bartender Dennys made us terrific cocktails.  The (212) is their spin on a manhattan and it's delicious.  We ordered the truffle burrata, mussels in white wine, seasonal gazpacho, and the steak frites.  All cooked to perfection. We will certainly return! ",5
" The front desk reception seems disorganized. We waited forever for our table even though we had s reservation. Not very attentive wait staff they all seem a bit confused. The food was ok, not amazing. ",3
" Management/Wait staff need fine tuning.  Arrived on time for reservations, checked in and we were asked to wait. Which we couldn't understand since the restaurant was fairly empty. There were quite a few people waiting not sure why since as I  said it wasn't  busy. When we were seated, we were totally ignored  for a good 15 minutes, and I had to go up  to  the hostess to ask them to send a waiter/waitress over. I was told someone would be right over and again we waited. We were about to leave when someone finally showed up. We received no apology and I had to ask if there were any specials. Overall management/wait staff seemed disorganized and not very energetic or personable. It's a shame since our food and drinks were very good, but I don't think we will return due to the  bad service. ",3
" The service was great, I never exactly got his name, but he was great! There was a cute little local market going on outside, where we sat, that provided a good ambiance and vibe for the afternoon brunch.  There was a party going on inside - that shut down the main dining area -  but we were called before (since we had a reservation) and warned about this, so it was totally cool.  The food was delicious, and I would for sure recommend this for someone else! ",4
" We went to Cross &amp; Orange not long after they opened and we enjoyed it.  Then I started hearing about multiple re-vamps to their menu over time, so I decided not to return, until hearing some positive buzz about it the last few months.  So we went for my wife's birthday today.  Food was excellent, especially my surf n turf special!  The steak was cooked and seasoned so perfectly it didn't need the accompanying sauce.  Service from Julio was good although there were a few times I had to get his attention, such as when I needed silverware for my entree, but that's forgivable since I'm kind of uptight when it comes to service.  The pot de creme for dessert was just right as a finisher.  We'll be back soon! ",5
" Exceeded my expectations. Thought this was going to be ""gastro-pub"" fare but it was far more sophisticated and inventive and healthy. Our waiter was friendly, informative and on the ball as was the hostess. Really good drinks too.  In a competitive Asbury Park restaurant scene, this place scores high. We will definitely return. ",5
 Best Burger in Asbury! ,5
" Waitress was terrible forgot to order one of our appetizer 's,brought dessert but no utensils. Never asked if we wanted another drink.We ate our desserts with our coffee teaspoons. Told the manager but they did nothing. Nice place but we had a terrible waitress! ",3
" Brought our 3 kids (ages 14, 11, 11) here for a nice family dinner down at the shore after a day at the beach.  It was fab!  I'm extremely picky, allergic to a lot, and have a limited diet.  I am famous amongst my family for sending my food back or just not liking it.  But Cross and Orange was awesome!  One of the best pork chops I've had in a long time!  I didn't love the beet salad- idk why restaurants serve those weed-like greens in the salad (frise)- but otherwise, everything else was great!  My kids enjoyed the steak burger, grilled octopus and burrata.  My husband really liked the ragu. Overall, we had a great meal and a great night! ",5
 First time here very pleasant experience  would go back. ,4
" I've been here a few times before and it was ok.  The issue we all had with our experience was that we ordered wine and barely got 6 ounces in a glass.  We did bring this up to our waiter and he said that they had a measured pour.   It looked like about 4 oz. to me.   Also, as an appetizer we ordered mussels.  We asked for more bread as there were 4 of us and 3 pieces of bread.  We were charge $2.50 for additional bread.  One person had to return skirt  steak because it was too tough to cut.  The server said that was the nature of skirt steak!!  I don't think so!   At best, it was a 2 star experience.  Too bad, as the location and decor is very comfortable.   Our server was good, but I'll bet he thought we were PIAs ",3
 We tried Cross and Orange for the first time and we are glad that we did.   The online photos don't do it justice.  The  atmosphere is much more cozy and attractive than it seems in the photos.  The tables are nicely spaced  and comfortable so that you don't feel as if you are on top of other people and hearing their conversations or struggling to have your own.  I tried a signature cocktail which was nicely prepared.  The menu  was creative and the food was very fresh and was prepared with locally sourced ingredients.  The service was excellent and the staff was friendly and very attentive.  I was so pleased that I asked to see the manager so that we could tell him how much we enjoyed our dinner.  We can't wait to return. ,5
" Awesome food, great service! Had the wild mushroom flat bread, grilled octopus, beet salad and the truffle burratta for appetizers. Amazing! For the main course we had the scallops, halibut, tuna and cauliflower steak.  Every meal was delicious!  Waitress was friendly and attentive. Great drink selection too. Would highly recommend! ",5
 We thought this was going to more of a gastro pub -not enough beer choices. Also we made reservations on Open Table and had to settle for a less desirable time than we wanted. But the restaurant was almost empty when we arrived and didn't fill up at the time we wanted!  Food was good -I like the steak burger but my companions thought portions were skimpy. ,4
 The new chef is the best.   Everything was delicious.   It was our best meal ever at this restaurant. ,5
 Service was impeccable. Food was awesome. Patron Redbull Cranberry Cosmo - incredible. ,5
 Food was awful. Service was poor. Can't believe I spent $35 for a few bites of food. ,1
 Over priced buffet.   The quality of the food was no where near the price paid.   It's more like a $9.99 buffet and I would still be disappointed at that price.   The food was cold. not well prepared. and most chafing dishes were empty.   If you want to spend that much money go to a different restaurant.  Would not recommend to anyone. ,1
" The food was just ok, nothing special at all. If I would have known it was a buffet I would have never made the reservation. When I hit the link to look at the menu it was of the full menu and never said anything about a buffet. Very miss leading. ",2
" We went before the New Years Eve Jimmy Buffett concert. It was nice to be at the venue. I would do it again for the ease if the evening. The Patron was good, but not great. ",3
" For a hockey game, great atmosphere.... wonderful food ",5
" Cost equivalent to top notch steakhouse, but for a buffet. ",2
 Good option for dinner before a concert at Bridgestone. ,4
 Garth Brooks concert ,3
" We thought the food was quite delicious. Even though there wasn't an unbelievable variety, it was certainly enough to fill you up. ",5
" This used to be very good, however, I don’t think I would go back.  It’s so bad it’s perplexing.  They use poor quality ingredients to make upscale menu items.  It almost feels like you’re being scammed.  Everything looks good, the presentations similar to the early days of the restaurant but upon close encounters, the flavor is not only not there but it’s obvious the quality is not there.  Even the raisins in a cookie were of such poor quality it was difficult to determine what it was supposed to be. ",2
" I was  very disappointed over the quality of the food. we love this place our wedding reception was here so we  knew the food was great we just ate here at the earth wind and fire concert, but the food for the janet jackson concert was poor... ",2
" It was my first visit to this location, the food was good and my server was good, no real complaints, other than our table was wobbly and we almost spilled our drinks.  the server tried really hard to fix that, but it was worse than she could handle. anyway, not trying to make a big deal out of it.  the food was interesting and quite good.  The service was excellent, no complaints. The hostess was able to seat me earlier than my reservation time, and we appreciated that.  I was a bit disappointed with the price, but I knew how much it was going in, so no surprise there. would I recommend it to my friends?  most certainly, but I would warn them about the price. ",4
" Everyone in our party felt it was not worth the price paid.  The food looked very good, but it was lacking in flavor.  The fish was served cold (barely heated) to one in our party.  Two of us had chocolate mousse which was liquid instead of light and fluffy.   It was good to try the restaurant once before a Preds game, but it's unlikely we'd do it again. ",3
" My girlfriends and I were in Nashville to attend the Xscape concert and had reservations for Platinum. How convenient, right?  We had an awesome time here and the ambiance was great! Nice atmosphere and great food. ",5
 Went to Patron Platinum to wait the start of the concert. Atmosphere was good and it’s convenient for events. The buffet was not worth the price. ,3
" The food was delicious. The restaurant, very clean and all the staff very friendly and accommodating. The peach martini was excellent. Very convenient for eating before the game. It was a little pricey to eat here for more than a ""special occasion"" (in my opinion) every once in a while. But we enjoyed our visit and would go again for our next special night out. ",5
" We were new to Nashville and made a reservation for 12 for a 50th birthday party.  We didn't realize this was part of the hockey arena and since there was a game that night, the only option was a buffet for $34.95 that was horrible.  2 of us researched this place and looked at their online menus and this was not obvious that is what we would be stuck having to order.  This was a horrible experience for dining and we should have left as soon as we were seated, but obviously trying to find another option on a Saturday night downtown in Nashville for a larger group wasn't really a great choice either. ",1
 We have eaten here prior to Predators games and concerts held at the Bridgestone Arena. We enjoy the convenience of not having to wait 30-45 minutes to be seated and that we are already inside the arena and won't have to fight the crowd later. The buffet has been a bit different each time and provides a variety of fare. We have never left hungry! ,4
 Have been going to the Patron for years prior to hockey games and special events. Service and people are top notch and food WAS worth the money. Appears that new Management has taken over and this trip was not a winner for the most part. Hope it makes a comeback. ,3
" We had a 5:00 PM reservation before a Preds game, so the restaurant was very empty when we started.  The ""buffet style"" menu was very limited considering the price you pay.   My expectations may have been too high going in, but for $110 tab and only two drinks, I was expecting a little more substance. ",3
" Great venue if your attending a function at the Bridgestone Arena.  Good food and a perfect spot to eat prior to our seeing Preds vs. Penguins. Service was excellent. Great building and fans, one of best we've been in in the NHL ",5
" Food was exceptional , The waiter was extremely slow on getting drinks in bringing checks , The alcoholic drinks were extremely overpriced $14-$15 a drink I would go for food only ",4
" The meal was terrible.  It was a buffet, and the choices were paltry at best.  Protein?  Choice was pork loin, catfish or (cold) sliders. $35.  That was the choice.  Yuck.  The wine list was infuriating.  You could either buy a bottle at a ridiculous markup or if you opted for by the glass, the choices were very few and nothing good.  Probably so you felt forced to buy an overpriced bottle.  Perfectly terrible experience.  Yes, convenient. ",1
" Great for a group in Smashville.   Had a group attending a weeknight Preds game.  With Nashville traffic, getting to a sit down restaurant all at once and getting in and out for a good meal would be a tall order.    Patron Club to the rescue.  Folks hit the buffet at their arrival and convenience.   Selection was sufficient.  Food was good, not great, but good, and much better than you would expect at a sports arena.  Will do again! ",5
 Went to eat before attending the Katy Perry concert at the Bridgestone arena. Had a great time. Food was amazing and service was great. ,5
" Great service!, ",5
 My husband and I have a great time and enjoyed it !! ,5
" What  a great place to enjoy a meal before an event at Bridgestone.   The food was delicious, service great added to the convenience of walking to your seat.   We loved it ",5
 The patron club was a fantastic setting for a nice dinner before a concert. Definitely a nice hidden gem. ,5
" Enjoyed the atmosphere and service.  Food, in general, was tasty, but the petite sirloin lacked flavor and was underdone, with no option for those who preferred beef but wanted it at least medium.  Even when I began to ask if there was a portion with less red, I was told ""No"" before I even completed my question.  The other food was good, but one person in our party does not eat chicken and the beef was not prepared well enough for him. ",4
 Really I nice place to dine before a preds game or any other venue ,5
" Patron Platinum Club offers the convenience of eating in the arena before a game/event, and not much else. The staff is friendly, polite, helpful. The food, however, isn't worth the price. It's a buffet where the food is rarely better than warm, never hot. The selection is often lacking. I truly wish Bridgestone Arena had more dining options. Could eat at The Palm across the street for better value. ",3
" It's a buffet. For the price, it was well worth the value with top of the line seafood and steak. ",4
" It's a upper class buffet in Bridgestone Arena. You can't expect too much, but the food is good and to avoid the crowds downtown around bigger events, it's worth the mo way. Staff is great. ",3
 Great and  convenient before a concert. Food was good. Service was slow and took a long time to receive cocktails. ,4
 Dinner before concert ,5
" Went before the predators game. Food had no flavor, was greasy, and is not worth the money. Desert was extremely sweet and dry. Food needs lots of seasoning. For $49.99 I can eat at a restaurant down the street and have a 5 star meal. The waiter was not having a very good day, forgetting drinks, not refilling drinks, asking if we wanted a to go cup and proceeding to bring an empty cup for us to poor our drinks that had been sitting on our table for 20 minutes into.   We had the prime rib, which was the fattiest piece of meat I've ever tried to eat. The pork was dry and over cooked. Risotto was not done and gritty. Maybe from the mushrooms not being washed properly or the risotto not being checked before sending it to the public.  Had pan seared tuna on special but once again no flavor, bland, and the only flavor was the topping. ",2
" On Sunday, April 30, 2017, I was fairly disappointed with my groups experience at the Patron Platinum Club. There were six of us in our group.  Some aspects of the experience was very good. The host team were welcoming, friendly, and showed genuine appreciation for my repeat business. The service provided by our server, Nathan, was very good and at the right pace. He was friendly, courteous, and very respectful of our time and enjoyment of meal. The Shrimp &amp; Grits chef table was the highlight of the visit. I am not a huge fan of grits here in Nashville, but this meal blew my expectations away. The gentleman serving the dish was also professional and served the dish with a smile. These were the extent of the positive experience.  Now comes the issues that ruined the whole experience. First, the man carving the ham dish was probably the most rude and unpleasant staff member on the floor. Even after saying hello to him, he didn't bother to acknowledge people. With no smiles or pride in serving the dish, I hate to say this but the person should not be working in this industry. Next, the food for the most part was disappointing. The ham was sub-par. The scrambled eggs were dried up, overcooked, and rubbery. The waffles were bland, overcooked, and hard. The chicken served with the waffles were so overcooked to the point that the meat were dried up and very hard to cut with a knife; it was not tender at all. The Rosemary Maple Syrup was overpowered by the rosemary herb. What is worst is the fact that it was advertised as maple syrup, and it was not. It was a watered-down regular syrup masked by the overpowering rosemary herb flavor. Finally, the bread pudding dessert was so hard and dry you could barely scoop it off the pan. Except for the Shrimp &amp; Grits items, almost all of the other items were a joke.  Lastly, plates were delivered so slowly by staff that people were losing their appetite. Also, staff was collecting plates even when guests were still eating off of them. ",2
 Always a winner--you can really count on Adele's to deliver great food and friendly service.  Their Sunday Brunch is the best value anywhere. ,5
 Our first time there &amp; we were not thrilled with our food. Neither entree had much taste &amp; was way overpriced.  Our waiter &amp; the service were great. Probably will not go back. ,3
" Wow, what a cool brunch concept! They basically reinvented the brunch buffet and made it so much better. I am vegan and they had lots of options for me. I also really appreciated that their carving station had an entire pig--which means they are very conscious of how they buy and showcase meat. It also has a cool, energetic vibe. I would highly recommend this place! ",5
 The kale salad was outstanding and so was the steak ,4
 This is our second time to eat at Adele's and both times the food was fantastic &amp; the service was great. We love the variety on the menu. There's always an unusual meat or dish that makes it unique. ,5
" Really nice spot for a get-together with friends. We ordered the pork belly and meatballs for starters and then the JW chicken, pork loin, kale salad, mixed greens, brussel sprouts and potatoes for the main course. Everything tasted great especially the pork loin, brussel sprouts and potatoes.   The only criticism is that it was 12degrees outside and they sat us in the heated patio. It was hot one minute and then a draft of cold air would hit us. Not a huge deal. Also, the old fashioned is more of a new fashioned. They added some twist to it that we did not really like. Ambiance, service, etc was great as well. ",5
" Waiter was excellent. He was VERY knowledgeable, friendly and stopped by our table “just enough”. His service could not have been better. Our group loved the interior/ambiance although it was a little loud. The food was good, not spectacular. I thought the portions were small (redfish) and I needed a snack when I got home! I would like to see some more options without carbs &amp; sugar😉 ",4
 The food was great and wait staff was very attentive and knowledgeable! The Brussels sprouts are delicious! You must try the potatoes! They are seasoned perfectly and lightly crispy on the edges. ,5
" Great effort but just misses. The ambiance at Adele's was nice, with great lighting and a comfortable upscale feel.......except for the two large TV over the bar which kill the farm to table vibe they are going for, and the music, which was a harder modern rock didn't help. So they almost got the ambiance perfect. The food? Fine but not outstanding. Nothing bad to note but also nothing to brag about. With so many other great restaurants around, we probably won't be back soon. ",3
" Service was great.  Ambience was also nice. Food wasn't memorable, unless you like  your ribeye and toast on an appetizer burnt like charcoal.  There's so many places to try in Nashville we wouldn't return. ",3
 First time visit. Great food selections.  Everything was very tasty.  Would eat here again. ,5
" A great experience all around! Outstanding service by our server, Garriosn; and for a party of 7, that’s not easy. We had appetizers, salads, entrees and dessert-everything  was  great, and we loved the atmosphere. I don’t know why we had not been here before, but can’t wait to go again!!! ",5
" Excellent service, and the food was even better.  Share an appetizer, but make sure you have the kale salad as well.  Menu changes frequently, but don't worry.  It's all wonderful! ",5
 Really enjoyed adeles. Went on a double date with my wife and another couple. It was probably my 4th time eating at Adeles since moving to Nashville. Really good menu and always appreciate that the wine list is fairly reasonable. ,5
" I have had my eye on Adele's for several weeks now. My husband and I came here for a nice date night and were not disappointed. We sat on the heated patio which was very beautiful, and had wonderful service the whole night. Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu, and made us feel very comfortable. Everything we ate was delicious! We had the meatball and the cheese and bread (I can't remember the name) appetizer which were devoured before the server probably left the table.  For dinner my husband had the hanger steak,  I had the pork belly, and we shared a side of Brussel sprouts. I am a true lover of pork belly, and this was the best I have ever had. We highly recommend this place, especially for a nice night out of the house. It is a cool atmosphere, with top quality food and service! Thanks again Adele's! ",5
" Nice atmosphere, excellent service and delicious meal ! We had kale salad, brussel sprouts, jw chicken and hangar steak. Food was presented beautifully and tasted spectacular! Would highly recommend! ",4
 We were in Nashville for a long weekend meeting a friend. Adele’s was very pleasant. The highlights of the meal were the gnocchi and kale salad ,4
" Recommended highly by friends, we went to Adele’s for an anniversary dinner, and were not dissapointed. We started with the cauliflower salad, which was the only dish we had a complaint with. It was overly vinegary, which we got used to, but it covered the taste of the raisins and pistachios. Other than that, it was an outstanding dinner. We had the pork belly appetizer, the duck breast with parsnip puree (amazing), and the bucatini carbonara. Kathy is a stickler for eggs, and they aced the egg on the bucatini. Quite a feat. We finished with a couple of deserts, and look forward to going back. Our server Sierra, btw, is as good as they come. Thanks. ",5
" Great food, comfortable atmosphere, friendly staff ",5
 Awesome in every way! ,5
" What a great experience.  Attention to the details was most impressive for me after being around Nashville for a couple of three days.  Chairs were comfortable, cutlery was awesome, (waitress brought us three sets during our meal), napkin was a nice fabric.  To top it off the wait staff was excellent as they worked together to ensure that the dining experience was on spot.  They were very prompt, the timing was impeccable between the appetizers, entree's  and the coordination of drinks.    Wait staff was second to none as to what we experienced in Nashville.  Exclamation point on a fun trip to the city.  Thank you from Canada! ",5
 Very cool industrial style space. A great buffet brunch. We were seated immediately.  Would definitely recommend for lunch/brunch ,4
" Awesome brunch!  There were many good options on this buffet style brunch. A friend and I went on a Sunday.  We were glad we had a reservation as the joint was jumping!  Benton’s bacon (crispy but served room temp), shaved roast beef (with a yummy, creamy horseradish sauce), smoked salmon as well as pastries, eggs (not wild about them but the frittata was good), and OH MY French toast that was a slice of heaven!  I also loved the apple crisp on the dessert table that came out in a piping hot iron skillet. Service was uneven but the coffee was good. While all the food wasn’t hot, it was tasty.  I would definitely pick this for either a group or a couple and will go again! ",4
 The Sunday brunch is a must! Absolutely delicious! I would recommend making a reservation just to assure you get a table vs waiting for 45 mins to an hour. ,5
 Adele’s Brunch is amazing and service is always great!! ,5
" The restaurant was lovely.  The food was delicious.  Unfortunately, the service was really really bad.  Our waiter was quite  indifferent.  We sat for a good 15 min before anyone came to the table.  After putting our order in we rarely saw our waiter again.  Just the expediters who delivered our food.  We were only in Nashville for two nights and this restaurant came very highly recommended so it was disappointing.  The food was delicious.  Unfortunately the lousy service overshadowed the cuisine. ",2
 Always a great place to eat.  We had a great time and will be back again soon!!! ,5
 Vwry slow  food service ,3
" Great atmosphere, easy parking &amp; very friendly service! ",5
" What a wonderful time we had at Adele's! The food was delish, the seating was comfy, the atmosphere delightful. But best of all was the service! We were blessed to be waited on by Asha, a delightful young woman who took great care of all of us. I can't wait to go back!!! ",5
 Good date spot with lots of whiskeys to enjoy. ,4
" There was nothing at this restaurant that was short of spectacular!!!! If you’re a foodie at any level, you MUST eat here...... and I mean MUST!!! ",5
 We all had a different entree and each was well prepared and presented. From pork lion to redfish and duck. The kale salad was excellent as were the side dishes ,5
" Amazing food done right. Fresh, flavorful, amazing cocktails, great atmosphere. Would come back all the time. So glad we thought of this on our last night in Nashville. ",5
 Great food and excellent atmosphere. JW Chicken and JW potatoes were excellent. Highly recommended! ,5
" My friend and I were celebrating job promotions. This brunch is a little pricey, but excellent for a ""treat yo' self"" day. ",5
 Brunch buffet had a great selection! ,5
" Consistently great food, wonderful service and very friendly people--you will love the food here and enjoy the people that prepare and serve it just as much! ",5
" Great atmosphere and just the right sized portions. Loved the crispy shrimp appetizer. Our family had the steak, duck, pork and gnocchi and they were equally delicious. It is cool without trying to be. ",5
 One of the top places in Nashville.  They desperately need to add white wine alternatives. ,4
" My grandmother comes to town once a quarter for market. The older ladies were slow walking, so we were a little late. They ordered the kale salad, which had absolutely zero kale. The Larry Burger, which we all had as our entire, is always delicious,  but this time nothing else was good. I also ordered a side of Brussels sprouts, which were extremely salty and not fully cooked through.   Our server was solid. I’ve had him a few times before, but he never told us his name. Overall it was way too loud. Will be back for a whiskey and a burger during off hours on the weekends, but definitely not the experience I was hoping for. I’ve been several time during peak hours and not had as severe a problem. ",2
" The house cocktails were amazing!  Our server gave us incredible reviews of everything we asked about.  Service was timely and thorough, but not invasive.  We will definitely come back! ",5
 Way too loud- you can barely have a conversation given the music and the number of people.0 ,3
 Great happy hour or date night spot. Food was great. Very creative house cocktails. Atmosphere very cool. Not a huge place but great scene. ,5
" Thoroughly enjoyed my brunch dish... Shakshuka. Sounded good on menu, but it was incredible! My husband also enjoyed The Larry Burger tremendously. Yum! ",5
" Great find! Delicious food, hip vibe. Simply awesome. Would go often if I lived in Atlanta; while not a vegan/vegetarian restaurant, there are plenty of options to choose from as-is or ask to be modified. I'm sure the staff would be more then willing ",5
 We always enjoy the Lawrence.  This time we introduced some friends to the Lawrence. Our only complaint would be how loud it was for a weekday dinner.  It was difficult to have a 4 person conversation. ,4
 The duck was incredible ,5
 It was my son's 16th Birthday and I allowed him to go alone with his girlfriend for dinner.  He couldn't stop talking about the experience all night.  The staff was great- food wonderful  He said they ordered four steaks and each was better then the last.  I want to thank the staff for taking such great care of my not so little boy.  Darren ,5
" We go to the Fox once a month for a show, and like to try new restaurants each time we do. The biggest challenge is having enough time for dinner, as we come in town from OTP and traffic often delays us. The Lawrence has prompt, quick service, and we were done with dinner with plenty of time to get to the Fox. The food was delicious! We both had the burger (SO GOOD), tried the Duck Tongue Wontons for an app (seriously - try it!), and butter pecan cake for dessert. All was more than I expected and very good. Our server, Annelise, was cheerful, assertive and prompt. I had the Sauvignon Blanc, and it was an excellent wine. A little more $$$ than I wanted to spend, but for a special occasion it would be a great choice. We will go back! ",5
" The food was incredible, the waiter was very knowledgable about the menu and my allergies. ",5
" I came here before our show at the Fox Theater. The atmosphere, food, drinks and service were all incredible. 15 minute walk to the Fox. Perfect for a nice night out. ",5
" The Lawrence satisfies time and again. Every time we come here, we are delighted by the handcrafted cocktail menus. The entrees are always cooked to order and the wait staff is fantastic. Please bring back the dessert cocktails to the menu! ",5
 Great food and drinks! Friendly staff and eclectic ambiance. Geared towards young and/or hip crowd. ,5
 Excellent service! I always have a pleasurable experience at The Lawrence!! ,5
" I highly recommend The Lawrence - the food, servers, atmosphere, and drinks.  Will be a new go to place for drinks with friends or dinner.  I cannot wait until it's warmer and am able to sit outside.  The one thing that I really liked was that there was a large group sitting behind us, but the acoustics keep it from being loud. ",5
 Have eaten here a couple of times before shows at the Fox. The food is delicious and they have great snacks to share. Will come back and try the patio when the weather gets warmer. ,5
 Food was really good but small serving sizes for the price. ,4
 Apps were all good. Ahi Tuna was solid. Mussels were amazing! Main entrees of elk and prime rib were so-so. Would not recommend entrees just apps and cocktails. ,4
" Nice build out.   Nice wine list and cocktail list.  Server was nice but disappeared at times.  Steak frites was cooked perfect and tasted great, chicken was dry and over cooked.  Tuna app tasted off.  Mac and cheese and farro were great. ",4
" With a goup of friends for NYE... they had a special limited menu for the evening. The decor, ambiance and service were outstanding. However everyone was underwhelmed by the majority of the food. Craft cocktails were good, but beware they may not have your normal beer or liquor selection. Served as a great time with friends, but not our best choice for food in the city... especially given the price. ",3
" Love the Lawrence.  Feel like the prices are steep for the food, which can be less than exceptional.  Still, it’s a neighborhood favorite with great cocktails and fantastic people watching.  Thanks for helping me and my friend ring in 2018! ",5
" I stumbled upon this place when searching for places to dine on NYE with some friends from out of town.  And buddy was I not disappointed!  The food was incredible and our waiter did a stellar job introducing us to many of the tasty cocktails on the menu.  My recommendation - make sure to try the Old Fashioned and the jalapeño cornbread.  Little pricey of a place, but worth every penny.  I will most definitely be back! ",5
" Great for a date night, great cocktails. A little noisy, but nice lighting and friendly staff. ",5
 Drag show was amazing! ,5
" Excellent service, food and drinks!!! The staff was friendly, accomodating and attentive to all our needs. The Larry burger and the shrimp n grits were awesome! Also try the deviled eggs...mmm! Great cocktails and wine selection. Will be returning to The Lawrence soon!!! ",5
 The music was too loud for such a small room.  Also we made a reservation in advance but were still seated at a table that was close to the entrance and very drafty.  My dining companion had a broken chair and no one offered to replace it for her.  One of our friends order the Elk Osso Bucco and said that it was very tough.  Previous experiences have been better and much more relaxing.  Not sure if we will go back. ,3
" Always a good meal. The Lawrence changes menuea seasonally and currently the winter menu is spot on. Lots of great options. Be sure to get cocktail too, always delicious. ",5
 The service was attentive and efficient. Food was excellent. Will definitely visit again!!!! ,5
 45th Birthday!! ,5
 Really great food in a great athmosphere. The music was on the louder end but we had a great time. Absolutely affordable pricing and good wine selection. ,4
 Food is always great! Superb service from Casteell made the night. ,4
" Good food, great ambiance, friendly service ",5
" A wonderful experience. Excellent food, great atmosphere, excellent drinks. ",5
 It's my neighborhood restaurant and it's always a great place for a date. The cuisine it's always unique and very satisfying ,5
 The food was great but our server (Eddy) acted as though he did not want to be there or to serve us. I ordered a cup of coffee but it was finally brought to our table when we were getting up to leave. He seemed very annoyed that I wanted the charge ($7.00)removed from our bill. I also thought $7.00 was a ridiculous  price for a regular coffee. We had been to the Lawrence before and did not have this issue. His attitude really put a damper on the evening. ,3
 This was our first time there.  The food was excellent and the martinis were awesome.  Definitely will plan on returning there. ,5
" Decor was nice, service was good.  The food was not good unfortunately.  We ordered the steak frite (very salty meat and fries were soggy) and scallops on risotto - 3 small scallops that were so rubbery I didn't want to eat them.  Risotto was good.  It did surprise me that that you only got 3 small scallops on a $30 entree - but after I tasted it I was glad there wasn't more because I only ate one.  Will not be returning unfortunately. ",2
" Our server was terrible! Inattentive, unfriendly, etc. ",3
" Friends raved about this place. When finally trying it out with other friends, unfortunately the food did not add up to the expectation. Two burgers were way overcooked and charred, and the bun was tough. :( The first duck entree was overly salty and the second was undercooked. Perhaps the main chef was off this evening? The snacks, cocktails, and our company were the best part about dining at The Lawrence. ",2
" We had been to Hemingway's once before, but just for a drink at the bar.  This time, we decided to have dinner here.  My husband and I split the romaine salad, Korean BBQ chicken and the Tagliatelle pasta dish.  I had a gin cocktail and my husband had Hemingway's version of a Manhattan.  Our drinks were excellent and the service was outstanding.  I would rate each of our dishes as good to very good.  The caesar salad was very good.  Liked the Korean BBQ Chicken, but didn't think it was as special as it was touted to be by the waitress (house specialty) and probably wouldn't order it again.  The tagliatelle pasta was also good, but it was pretty oily and there was a large amount of oil left in the bottom of the bowl after we ate it.  We did have a very nice chocolate/ caramel dessert at the end of our dinner which I would recommend.  Would be nice if they had more seafood on the menu.  Scallops were the only seafood entree (fish of the day) I recall being available.  The acoustics in the restaurant don't do enough to diffuse the noise - it was loud where we were sitting.  Would return for the bar, but given the number of other excellent restaurants in Nashville, would probably give those a try before returning for dinner. ",4
 Pleasantly surprised on both drink and food menus. All was perfect !! ,5
 First time at Hemingway's and we loved it.  Food was excellent starting with the crispy Brussels sprouts.  Also tried the beer cheddar soup and it was amazing.  I had the Korean Fried chicken and my husband had the beef stew and both were really good.   Nice to be able to get free street parking too. ,5
" A ""Hideaway"" indeed. I love this place. It's tucked away, in what I can only imagine will be another up and coming area, right outside of downtown Nashville. Great food, AWESOME ambiance, fantastic drinks. We've been to this place twice in the past month and can't wait to return! ",5
" Our server was moderately attentive at first, but he dropped off the face of the planet once our food was served. The food was good - I had the breakfast poutine. It was a bit overpriced, though. The atmosphere was wonderful. I loved the design of the restaurant. I would like to try their other meals. ",4
" Great meal, excellent cocktails.  Our waiter, Anthony, was great.  Very happy with experience and will be back! ",5
" This place is highly overrated. The food is average. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. The alcoholic beverage, pickle Richard is very good, that's it. ",3
" Comfortable and casual, Hemingways delivers delicious entrees and interesting drinks. ",5
 My Roasted Duck Breast was too tough to eat. Others' meals were apparently good. ,3
" Our first visit won't be our last!  We enjoyed everything about this place.  Location, ambiance, and service were great.  The food was superb.  We split the ribeye (recommended as it is 32oz!) and still had leftovers to take home.  Brussel sprouts were fantastic even heated up the next day.  Anthony took exceptional care of us.  We are not big cocktail drinkers but he took the time to ask what we did like in a drink and gave us the perfect recommendation.  So many places to dine out in Nashville, but this is one NOT to be missed. ",5
" The drinks were tasty, the food was unique and tasty, and the place was comfortable and inviting. A enjoyable experience. ",4
" We had a wonderful experience here on our date night last week! Food and service was fantastic!! Too many things we wanted to try on the menu, so we will definitely be back! ",5
" The Scallops were totally OFF.  Smelled and tasted absolutely putrid.  Sent them back and they brought out MORE putrid shellfish then only took $5 off of the bill!    The Korean Chicken was cold and greasy and essentially tasteless.    Furthermore, the creative cocktails were barely average in quality and imagination.    A night and long drive wasted. ",2
 Loved the food. Recommend brunch poutine. Tacos tasty maybe crispier hash browns. The noise was live able because it wasn’t packed but sound panels would make a world of difference in the dining experience. Charming atmosphere. We’ll go back for dinner. ,5
" There for lunch on Weds and dinner on Sat.  Two different groups of people and two different menus.  All wonderful, thanks. ",5
 The most inventive and amazing cocktails ever. Chicken and dumplings was divine though I wish I had that as the appetizer and the butternut squah dish as my entree ;) ,5
 Great new place in a hidden unsuspected area.  Best Pickled Richard drink with pickle juice and blackberry preserves.  So yummy.  Mahi was divine over goat cheese grits!!! Atmosphere was so eclectic with a cosmo vibe!!  I’d definitely go back. ,5
 A bit tricky to find and you have to park on the street which can get crowded. We went to brunch and the door was locked. They let us in after peeking in windows. Then they still didn't unlock the doors. This happened a few more times before they did. Very strange. The food was good. I didn't think anything was unique. They have brunch but don't have lattes or specialty coffee drinks. Just plain black coffee. ,4
" Our new favorite spot! We came here on a date night &amp; had been trying to decide between all the other new restaurants in town to try out. We picked Hemingway's because it had a great cocktail list &amp; delicious menu options for a cold night! It exceeded our expectations! Anthony made our experience exceptional (as always) with great food &amp; wine recommendations. You MUST try the chicken &amp; dumplings- WOW! One of my favorite dishes I've ever had. If you want a cozy spot for a bite with a killer bar &amp; relaxed atmosphere, this is it! Make this your next date night! ",5
 A great buzz in an up and coming neighborhood . Anthony was friendly and provided great servive. Had  the short rib stew and was yummy. Bar was hopping! ,5
" First time in, certainly not the last. The spirits list alone is enough to make the trip worth it (looking at you Pappy). The food was superb and the staff wonderful, even on a busy night. ",5
 Great bar manager... great burger &amp; amazing poutine! ,5
" i went here with some friends and the flavors were a bit too strong with each item i ordered. the beef tartare had WAY too much horseradish on it and the homemade tagliatelle was COMPLETELY over saturated with red peppers. i couldn’t eat it the peppers were so strong ... i can’t say i’ll never go back, but if i do it’ll just be for drinks. i’m not sure they try the food before it leaves the kitchen. which is a bummer. ",2
 Amazing! Best food and atmosphere in the city hands down! ,5
 We ate here New Year’s Eve and although the food was delicious it was ice cold and our cocktail pairings for each course unfortunately were always delayed that we missed them with each course....We did enjoy the food so we do plan to go back on a week night to give it one more shot. ,5
 Food was over-priced. Great ambience. ,3
" Great cocktail list; fair beer list, dominated by locals. Duck poutine and pork belly were quite good as starters. Duck main cooked to perfection . Chicken and dumplings the ultimate comfort food . A really good server (Nathan) coupled with great food can make dining out a memorable experience. We’ll definitely be back. ",5
" Fun place, but very loud. Hard to have a conversation. Interesting &amp; strong drinks. Food was good but very strongly flavored. For example the brussel sprouts were very vingary. Really wanted to but couldn't finish them. Korean fried chicken was quite spicy. I'd go back and try other things next time. ",4
 I just want to say that I have tried to contact them about a situation three times and I’ve got received no want to call me back to messages and one phone message and no return from anybody had a bad experience was so looking forward to it my family was so looking forward to coming down there at a later time we have canceled our plans and soon since I got no response from you guys ,1
" This was not a comfortable experience. From the over salted food to the way the waiter kept trying to rush us out.   This was the first time a server said that they have a reservation coming that will want our table. We had 4 meals, desserts, drinks etc and were expected to jump out of our seats when the check came. It was very awkward. ",3
" First time dining had lunch with co-workers. The ambiance is wonderful, the food is delicious. Hemingway's is definitely going in the dining rotation. Looking forward to having dinner here. ",5
" Pedestrian. It’s sad to see that this place has gone downhill. Used to be special,  it anymore. ",2
 Everything was amazing. Incredible service and food. Will definitely be back. ,5
" Great atmosphere, great food.   Unique location with arcade games, pub menu, great drinks and more.  Highly recommend. ",5
" Great food and service; limited menu, but with excellent choices.  French fries and kale salad were some of the best I've ever had anywhere.  Parking is on the street in a very dicey neighborhood.  I can see why it received the Best of Nashville new restaurant award. ",4
 The food is outrageously good. Like elevated home cooking. Obsessed ,5
 This place is a hidden gem.  The experience was excellent as well as the food quality.    The duck poutine Fries were decadent!  The sea bass entree and the short rib stew were fabulous.   Will definitely return. ,5
 Nathan was an incredible server.  Cocktails were delicious. Great good for great value!! ,5
" We requested a booth and the hostess said it was for a larger party. The entire we were there it sat open until just before we left, and it was sat with a party of 2. Food was really good. Cocktails seemed overpriced. Loved the atmosphere but I think it would have been nice if they designed the space to be broken up a little. ",4
" Good cocktails, food was fine but nothing great.   Need to work on more options -  Our waitress was great!  Nice decor -  need to try again -  we always give restaurants 2 chances! ",3
 Fun girls night out.  We had a drink at the roof top bar prior to our meal.  Amazing views of the city. ,5
 Not worth the money at all!! The brunch had very few selections and the selections were very average. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone for any reason. An epic fail. ,2
" It is the strangest place - hardly a restaurant, more of a hotel bar. Had terrible live music (Please, stop doing this, I get that Nashville is music city but restaurants are only hurting themselves by hiring wailing wannabes.) Projecting weird music videos on the wall. Literally got up and left after a glass of wine (which we only ordered to be nice) and bailed for another restaurant. This is very poorly represented in its description - Don't be fooled! ",1
 Beautiful Establishment with Killer Drinks! ,5
" Service was amazing. Decor is modern and ambience was very good for date. Limited seating. Food is ok, nothing to write about. Drinks list is pretty good. Surely a gate spot. This is the casual restaurant on the ground/first floor of the Westin.  L27 - the new bar is on the 27th floor. Amazing views of Nashville. Head there after dinner ;-) ",4
" In a word:  underwhelmed. The kale and cauliflower salad was really good. The rest... meh. Drinks were mediocre. Bar staff was okay. Prime rib was over cooked. As a local, I was definitely in a hotel bar that served food. Not a restaurant. ",2
 Excellent food ,5
" Enjoyable, had a couple of hickups with the getting the meal as ordered however they made it right. ",4
 Advertised on Open Table that special for today was 25% off bottle of wine but after ordering was told that because it was a busy week no specials were being offered  Server said she would speak to Mgr but seems Mgr did not feel not feel appropriate to honor what was on Open Table  Very disappointed not only as Open Table member but also as  Marriott Gold Member ,2
 Primo was an excellent dining experience. The staff was attentive and helpful and the food was amazing. They made my special occasion even more perfect. ,5
" I really enjoyed our dinner at Primo. The service was very slow (not the food, the waiter). We tried to get her attention several times but she was no where to be found. And many of the other servers just walked by when we were very obvious about needing something. The food was great but we felt it was overpriced. Being that the restaurant was in a resort away from the city, we felt the entire resort raised their prices since people couldn't easily drive to the city. ",4
" Quite a nice surprise. We were celebrating our Anniversary and choose Primo. Nothing was lacking in the experience. We were treated to some complimentary Italian sparkling wine to start. My NY Strip was a different presentation, but none the less awesome.  My Lady's  scallops were great as well. Sara (our server) and the rest of the staff were more than accommodating. The meal was topped off with a pair of terrific cannolis, again on the house. Great experience and we will be back. ",5
 We had a great experience. The atmosphere along was worth going. The service was excellent and the food was delicious. Very pleased! ,5
" My wife and I were staying at the JW for the NYE weekend and on our first day we decided to try Primo instead of venturing into town for dinner.   We've had mixed experiences at hotel restaurants - so we came in with reasonable expectations - but we were blown away by our experience.   The space is very nice - great views and a cozy inside dining room.   The servers were attentive, gave great recommendations and management is present, checking in and support the staff as necessary.  We had a small issue with the food and it was corrected immediately.   The menu was very creative and I loved the local focus - including items from their own on-site garden.   We started with the Baked Brie, I then had the salmon and my wife and the scallops with made in house pasta.   She is Italian and couldn't stop raving about how good the pasta was.   We finished with the Canolis - that were so good and light we came back the next night to have them again.   So kudos Primo - thank you for an amazing experience and giving me faith in hotel restaurants again! ",5
 Beautiful views &amp; outside Dining😋food was yummy &amp; service AWESOME! ,5
 Primo is a great escape from the resort to enjoy some fine dining. The Happy hour during the week is fantastic and a great way to start the evening. Good wines (although selection could be increased) and fresh from scratch food is scrumptious. ,4
 Christmas dinner.  Delicious and loved the surroundings ,4
 Very disappointed in the Thanksgiving meal. Poor presentation. Poor choice of selections. Not worth the seventy-five dollar per person. Best thing on menu was dessert. ,1
 Ate at the bar. Savannah was attentive and delightful. Food delicious. ,5
 The first course of roasted green tomatoes and arugula soup was wonderful. The second course of margherita pizza was terrible. It had no flavor and the crust was soggy. Everything else about the evening was wonderful. ,5
" Great service in a lovely atmosphere, but kitchen does not understand the concept of hot food.  We returned both of our meals and they were brought back from the kitchen warmer, but not hot.  I expect better from a fine dining restaurant. ",4
 We had 2 dinners in Primo. Kate was our server and we asked for her again. Very friendly and knowledgeable. Menu was diverse. Highly recommend the Papardelle with Sea Scollops. Service from all staff was on point. ,5
" Fun evening! On the patio for my husband's birthday! Had pizza even though not on the menu, great! And for dessert the cannolis were excellent! Very good service ",5
 Exceptional. ,5
" Everything was great and the service was friendly and nice ! We had the specialty pizza, steak, and chicken and it was all wonderful ! Nice dinner with my family ! ",5
 Parent’s Weekend.  Great food ,5
 Service &amp; food was exceptional. Will return for another time ,5
" Honestly, the service here was terrible. We had a reservation at 6:30pm but arrived at 6:15pm. We were seated by 6:20pm. At 6:40pm, we still had not even placed our drink orders. When we finally did, they came relatively quickly. It took 45 minutes to receive our dinner after ordering. The food was good; however, the scallops were not cleaned before cooking so they were grainy. We decided to order dessert, which took over 20 minutes to arrive at our table.   The thing was, the restaurant was not that busy. There were several tables open. We also heard other guests around us complaining about how long their food was taking. One table actually sent back their meals twice - the first time was because it arrived cold and the second time was because their steaks were poorly seasoned.   I will say that the manager was friendly and bought our first round of drinks. He didn't seem apologetic at all though. I do feel for him, because he spoke to all of the tables around us and listened to their complaints. ",1
" Such an amazing experience! It was for our anniversary and everything was great! The food and the low lighting made for an ideal date night and the staff was attentive but not overwhelmingly so, they had the perfect balance. I would definitely recommend and will return in the future. ",5
 This is one of our go-to places for special family occasions and for simply catching up with friends.  The setting is beautiful and it is complemented with great service and wonderful food.   We will keep coming back. ,5
" If the halibut with preserved lemon beurre blanc is on the menu, don't pass it by--the sauce was terrific! One if the best fish dishes I've ever had. The new pizza guy is pretty good, too. ",5
" Went for dinner to celebrate our anniversary (we were staying the weekend in the hotel).  All of the staff went above and beyond to make sure that our meal was special- from beginning to end.  And our servers were very attentive to our daughter as well as to us.  Food was excellent (especially dessert- which they customized with our exact anniversary written in liquid chocolate!).  It is a hotel restaurant, so prices tend to be a little higher, but pretty typical compared to other similar-quality hotel eateries.  If in the area again, we are highly likely to return both to the hotel and Primo.  We definitely felt special our whole time there! ",5
" Great food, great service, but a bit pricey. The octopus dish was amazing. Knowledgeable staff in regards to wine pairing. ",4
" Food was excellent.  Our server was exceptional-- warm, friendly, entertaining, attentive. ",5
" Food is overpriced and the menu was very short and lacks variety. For example, salad with meat options as dinner entree did not exist, which is kind of basic meal. Kids menu was good, and service was friendly. I would not go there for food. ",3
 The  food was fantastic and our waitress was great. ,5
 Service and food was excellent! Got the Spanish octopus for an appetizer and it was very good. The scallops were my entree and it was outstanding. I'm very picky with seafood and I would highly recommend this place. My husband got the smashed pork and he loved it plus they even gave us these amazing lightly battered onions that I loved. Wonderful place. Portions are perfect size and the staff was awesome! Definitely going back! ,5
 The only reason I did not rate a full excellent for food is because I had my heart set on the salmon and was disappointed that it was not on the menu.  No other reason.  And our waiter quickly recommended an alternative that was delicious. ,5
" What a fabulous dining spot inside a fabulous hotel. Tucked away at the end of Starr Pass Rd next to the Tucson Mountain Park, saguaro cacti cover the hills at the J W Marriott.  The restaurant has a bar where pizzas are served as well as a dining room that is elegant and a menu that will please. Prices are a bit high but in line with what you would expect in a high end resort. ",5
 Everything was overly salted and seasoned. Very disappointing ,4
" From the moment we walked in,  we were greeted with a smile. As we walked through the dining room,  we observe the energy of the staff from the kitchen staff to the manager that was talking to guest.  Our server was very knowledgeable, she went through the menu and gave us great recommendations. Food was unbelievable, it was so delicious,  the flavors were succulent, one of a kind. We closed our eyes as we took our first bite, so much flavor, tenderness,  over all a well balanced meal. Thank you for an unforgettable evening. ",5
 Food so so ,3
" The soft-shell crab is back and it's as crispy and delicious as ever, and its accompanying salad has improved. If the Copper River salmon is still on the menu, it's truly one of the best fishes - bright orange and flavorful (I had it as tartare). There's a new wine dinner soon but we'll be out of town. The last one I attended was really good - great pairing of food and wine, and a good value at $75 (I think they might be getting a deal on the wine because the distributor/wine maker will be there, but not sure.) ",5
" We live in Tucson, but had not gone to Primo, so we decided to give it a try. This was our anniversary celebration dinner and it could not have been better. The excellent food, friendly service, and quiet atmosphere were perfect. And to our delight, a surprise complimentary, personalized dessert finished off the evening. We will return and bring friends to share the experience with us. ",5
 Great server Jessica. Very professional and accommodating. ,5
 We had a great time. We called ahead because two of my friends are vegans. The chef wss able to offer two choices for both appetizers and entrees. They loved it. The restaurant is attractive with spectacular views. ,5
 Wonderful dining experience. Try the ishiyaki and the crispy snap peas. ,5
 I had a wonderful time with my friend and had great service by Lance. First time eating sushi and had the crispy fire - super good! Would definitely go back! ,5
" This was my first time dining at Virago and it was a lovely experience. The restaurant is large yet intimate with lots of ambient lighting and rich earth tones.   The service was exceptional and the food was fantastic! We tried a variety  of options including: sushi rolls as well as some Toro and Salmon belly sashimi, fried brussel sprouts, lobster shots (Sipped, not shot), Watermelon pop rocks spicy tuna appetizer, a few different drinks, and a Crème Brulee for desert. Everything was delicious and the fish was so fresh! We'll definitely be back next week to try the Stone cooked wagyu beef. ",5
 Birthday Outing with Family ,5
 Amazing. Food was great. Service was great. ,5
 The food was good as was service but it was so incredibly noisy that I couldn’t hear the server.  Worst was that I couldn’t have any kind of conversation. Why go out with friends if you can’t even talk. Just sit at the bar ,4
 Virago was as awesome as ever. The coconut jasmine rice is to die for! I have always loved the stone steak (which is now called something else). Cooking it on your own hot stone is fun and delicious! We were very disappointed that the flash fried okra had been taken off the menu. It was our favorite dish. Hoping they will add it back on! ,5
 Good ambiance and service.  Food was over priced (thankfully we went on a half priced Monday). ,4
" The server mentioned us being there for a birthday and then also remembered it and comped our dessert at the end, all just from the Open Table reservation! We didn’t mention the bday to him once we were there.  That was a thoughtful touch. ",5
 Perfect start to a beautiful night. ,5
" The service was fantastic. The server was knowledgeable, patient, and willing to share his opinions. We had at least 10 different dishes. I would return for only 2 — one was beef and the other a salmon sashimi with lemon. Delicious. The mark up on bottles of wine is surely unnecessary, given the food &amp; cocktail prices. Not worth a return. ",3
" We loved the food and our server!! Atmosphere was nice.  We had reservation for 5:45, arrived at 5:30.  We were taken to a table next to the kitchen and asked for a booth. Though many booths were available, our only option was to wait in the front for 15 more minutes when more servers came in.  I suppose seating us in a booth offering drinks until a server arrived was not an option. We took the table by the kitchen, while it wasn’t noisy, it was very busy which is not relaxing.  Food and Server were amazing! ",5
 Just a phenomenal place and service was outstanding. I would highly recommend and the atmosphere was lively. Will return ,5
" Have wanted to go to Viragos forever! Guess I wIted to long? Our server was okay, but the ambiance was awful. They sat us next to a huge table of kids that the parents would not sit by, they were completely on the other side of the restaurant. But the biggest disappointment was the food, fatty, greasy and overcooked! Will never go back :( ",2
 Virago is always great!  New stuff on the menu...all delicious 🍾 ,5
 Fantastic!! ,5
 The best sushi in Nashville with s great atmosphere.  Love sitting at the bar ! ,5
 What a beautiful birthday place for celebration! ,5
" It was okay. I’d not realized they’d changed their menu to be tapas style, and I’m not a fan of tapas. Don’t get me wrong, the food tasted great, and I ended up happy with my meal, but it want what I expected for my birthday, and we ended up spending way more money than we intended to do, which was not the plan. ",3
" Very creative menu. Good food .good service.........."" ",5
 The service was great and the food excellent ,4
" My husband and I went to Virago for our anniversary. We loved everything about the experience: welcoming staff, knowledgeable and attentive wait staff, cozy feel despite being a pretty big space, interesting and creative menu with varied offerings, delicious food (we had the vegetarian sampler and Robata grill tuna plus creme brûlée and mochi dessert) and they surprised us with a special anniversary plate of a sashimi and grilled asparagus rose. And it was surprisingly reasonably priced for the quality - and quantity - of food. I can’t wait to go back and try more of Virago’s offerings! We had been to Kayne Prime several times and had similarly positive experience so the M Street group seems to have a winning formula - we now want to try their other restaurants!! ",5
" Virago never disappoints!  Awesome food, great service, and special birthday service too! It is kinda noisy and the lighting is dark, but it's still great. ",5
" Loved Virago for 10 Years! Consistently my favorite restaurant in Nashville. Whether it’s Maki Monday with my man, a big celebration with friends, or a work dinner. Always a treat! ",5
 Get the truffle Brussels! ,5
" I’ve dined at Virago since the old location. It never disappoints. Love the atmosphere, and the food is amazing. Especially loved celebrating  my recent birthday there with girlfriends. # Alwaysafavorite ",5
 Great service and great food. The options were awesome and the food was filling and delicious. ,5
" We had a lovely dinner for my birthday. We had a gift card.  The food was delicious, as always and the service was phenomenal. ",5
 Went before the symphony and food and cocktails were delicious  and service was punctual - no problem getting to the performance. ,5
 Over priced for quantity of food ,4
 Nicer than the evenings when it’s been way too loud!  Great service!  Great food!  Disappointed they’ve taken several items off the menu! ,5
" Virago is a fun, hip spot. Sushi and other items are well presented. Monday nights are special deals for happy hour and sushi so a great time to go. ",5
" We had a delicious meal and great service. Our almost 3 year old daughter was with us, and it was nice to know that the restaurant is family friendly as well! ",5
 Amazing time and awesome food every time we visit Nashville! ,5
 Great and quick service by Lance ,5
" The service, the atmosphere, the food are all wonderful. Love the lighting, the decor, and the music. Amazing sushi,  drinks, and presentation. I highly recommend them for romantic nights or any social dining. It's a favorite for us. ",5
" The server was great.... believe his name was Lee. My husband had never been before so we went for his birthday.  Only suggestion was that the hostess was snobby rude when we first arrived and it doesn't make for a good first impression.  She was prob in 20's and had blond hair. to her shoulders. Otherwise, dinner was great! ",4
" We felt forgotten by our waiter, but everything else was great! ",4
 We enjoyed our dinner with our daughter and her boyfriend. We shared our small plates and loved them all especially the brussel sprouts.  The salmon and filet mignon ere also delicious. ,5
" Great experience. Both food and drinks were pretty amazing. The Brussels sprouts were out of this world! Fun time family, I was back home visiting from NYC and were also celebrating my cousin’s 19th birthday! ",5
" Our group of four all ordered different items and shared, not a bad plate between the four.  The Duck Confit Poutine was outstanding.  The staff were very nice, and the location was easy to find.  Will definitely be back. ",5
 The service was really poor. Our server spent more time rolling silverware than checking on us. We were the first table seated for brunch and there were maybe  3-4 more by the time we left - so it wasn’t busy. Drinks took a very long time and only 1 was a cocktail (which was excellent). My filet was almost inedible because it was so over salted. My friend’s lox and bagel had salmon shavings rather than full pieces of fish. The hash browns were soggy. The burger and pancakes were good but they were simply not good enough to overcome how bad the other dishes were. And the meal was not cheap. Just a very bad all around experience. ,2
" Wedgewood/Houston has neat eclectic vibe. Had a good time but not memorable. Glad we went, but easily forgetable. Food has a home cooked rather than restaurant quality. ",4
 Great food small menu - owner/bartender said I️t’s  Bc everything is good ;) I️ believe him! Unique dishes very flavorful. Sat at the bar. Was hoping for a little more ambience/lively atmosphere. ,4
" Best kept secret in Nashville for a business lunch when you need a break from downtown - easy to get in and out, great menu (Best New Restaurant 2017), a daily blue plate special, all at a reasonable price point. ",5
 An understated little gem with exceptional food and a great Brunch menu. Unlimited mimosas and hot chicken tacos on a ranch waffle taco shell. Their Lox is also great. I've been the past four weekends and haven't had a bad time. ,5
 Food was phenomenal and service was outstanding. Quantity is a bit small but the quality makes up for it ,5
" A small group of us have taken to trying a new restaurant each Friday night.  We gave this place a try for its location and interesting menu.  We had an 8:15 reservation and only had to wait about 5 minutes for our table.  The cocktails were interesting and enjoyable, but a little too sweet to have more than one.  We share the duck, the chicken and dumplings and the fried chicken.  All of these were delicious and served hot.  By all votes, the chicken and dumplings won for the most flavorful.  The service was ok with regular but lengthy breaks between check-ins.  The noise level makes this a great place for someone looking to hang out with friends without really chatting.  Definitely too loud for a first date location!  Parking was adequate using the neighborhood businesses which were all closed.  Overall - this is a place I will go back to but won't make my top 10 list. ",4
 The food and atmosphere were really great! Risotto and duck were crowd favorites.  My only complaint was the place seemed to be under staffed so we had to wait a while for basic things that i have come to expect at that price point like ordering a bottle of wine for the table and not getting it till we’d had our meal for 6-8 minutes. We waited for serving utensils for apps for way too long. I would go back for sure in hopes that the server was just having an off night. ,5
 Another delicious meal at Hemingway’s!  Love the decor and all 4 of us enjoyed our lunch and our delightful server! ,5
 Birthday for my sister. Great food and ambience ,5
 The food was not up to par however the service at the bar was top notch ,3
 TERRIBLE. Will not be back. Service was horrendous. From the waiter to the manager.... ,1
 Great experience! Our server recommended cocktails based on our favorite drinks and they were perfect. All of the food we had was delicious. ,5
" We went here during our Nashville stay. It is in an old mill building that adds the charm of this place. The food was excellent, unique and would definitely recommend. The only downside was the restaurant was chilly... it was cold outside and the exposed vents were blowing cold air. Everyone in the restaurant had a sweater or jacket on while eating. Overall a great place for some very good food. ",4
" Love everything about the setting, decor etc. great wine selection. I ordered the duck which is a risk, it was a bit grisly for my taste but the stuffing was amazing! Wish I could of ordered the burger I’d heard great things about but that is at the bar only! ",5
" The decor and ambiance plus people watching so worth the trip. So the server was frazzled. I received my wine with dinner right behind my cocktail. BTW  the cocktail was unbalanced.and was heavy on cinnamon, the appetizers were followed by the entree in 3 minutes. We got the butternut squash risotto and it was outstanding!  The pork belly was tasty but was drowning in tasteless white beans. We also ordered the chicken and dumplings.  I've not seen it on a menu and it was recommended buy the server so we got it. Well, it has a serious pickled flavor. So if you love pickled veggies and chicken then this dish is for you. Now I love pickles...but not this dish. So onto dessert, hummmm they have coffee but no after dinner drinks. The dessert we chose was chocolate cream with a big hit of coffee like a tarimisiu in a jar. Make reservations for the weekend and enjoy the people watching. ",3
" There were not enough servers working so service was not good. When we did see our server however, he was very nice and informed ",5
" Hemingways’s was in a cool location with a relaxed, cool atmosphere. The service was terrific and the food was even better. Everyone loved our lunch and would defiantly go back again! ",5
" My husband and I loved this place!  We heard great things about it while enjoying pre-dinner cocktails at Corsair South just a few minutes away and decided to try the Duck Poutine before we even got to the restaurant.  We definitely weren't disappointed.  We also split two entrees; the Roasted King Trumpet Mushroom and whatever the Market Fish was that night.  I want to say it was Red Snapper, but I honestly don't recall.  Whatever it was, it was delicious and amazingly prepared.  The Mushroom dish was definitely my favorite; amazing flavor combinations and gorgeous presentation.  I can't wait to go back! ",5
 Fave place for dinner in Nashville! ,5
" The service, ambiance, and cocktails were great. The food was not good. The brussel sprouts were great, the rest was bland at best. The risotto had walnuts that tasted stale. The chicken pasta was very spicy but managed not to have any taste anyway. The worst was the red snapper special. It tasted like my dogs’ bully sticks smell. I could not even eat it. Bottom line, go for the cocktails and skip the food. ",2
" We so enjoyed our meal here while visiting Nashville! I went with two girlfriends and we ordered three entrees and nibbled off each other's plates. I got the Chicken and Dumplings and was blown away. Generous portion, delicious pulled chicken, and the sauce was so flavorful. Ultimate comfort food. My friends got the Grilled Pork Tenderloin and the Short Rib Stew, also delicious. The pork was cooked on the rarer side which I'd never had, it was great and not dried out like pork tenderloin can get at times. Duck Poutine was good as well, cocktails delicious. The only complaint I have is that service was a bit slow at times, with cocktails taking a bit and we had to ask twice for a refill on water. ",4
" The space was great.  The drinks were good.  The food for so-so.  The risotto in particular was just not good.  The service was poor, as if he had been a waiter for a week or so.  Not what I expect for the premium prices. ",3
" Hemingway's Bar has a clean look, enough space between tables you don't feel like the other diners are ""in"" your conversation and a great vibe. An eclectic mix of patrons -- all eating a homey, but modern version on Southern with a twist -- makes this the best of what ""the new Nashville"" should be. The hot chicken tacos with buttermilk waffle shells were a good mix of hot (not scalding) and comfort food, the filet was perfect, the burger exemplary. And the hashbrowns were exactly the kind you'd get at diners back in the day. With a diverse cocktail menu that evokes rather than gives the recipe, you can match your mood rather than overanalyze what's in your drink, making for a surrender to the moment ease of unwinding. Let your imagination -- and worries -- go. ",5
" Great place! Our first time, and we loved it. Everything is good-from the free and easy parking to the way they seat the guests, the staff was  very professional, the design and decor are great and the food was really outstanding. A really great restaurant. ",5
" food was great, service was outstanding. very nice location ",5
" Always trying to hit all the new restaurants in Nashville and this has been on my list for a few months. Some friends and I headed here for dinner, prior to a concert one night at Bridgestone. My friend was a little nervous of the address, but we were surprised of the rebuilding of the area. Hemingways is located inside an old warehouse type building that they have restored. The lobby has a strong musty smell, but we couldn't smell any of that inside the restaurant. The restaurant has a great vibe, but is a little cold and sparse. I think they could fill it up with more seating and it would feel and look nicer. The service was spot on and the food was excellent.  Our favorites were the duck poutine and the brussel sprouts on the app menu. Our favorite main course meals were the Korean chicken and chicken and dumplings. All portions were quite large, so you will get your monies worth.  The bar menu has a good ""speak easy"" feel to it. All the drinks we ordered were great! I think this place will continue to get better as the surrounding area finishes it rebuilding.  I will definitely eat here again. Great spot for large parties to, as they have one huge table in the middle of the restaurant. ",4
" Cozy, industrial styled restaurant in an up and coming neighborhood. Easily accessed by street parking. Great variety on menu and drinks were strong! ",5
" We’ve tried most of the new restaurants in Nashville,  but most don’t really have food good enough to justify the price. Hemingway’s was absolutely the exception! The food was amazing! Unfortunately the room was so loud you could barely hear the waiter, much less your date. I think this has more to do with a trend of  diners treating nice restaurants like bars, and I’m not sure there’s anything the venue can do.... ",4
" LOUD, LOUD, and louder.  Average food, good service, but so incredibly loud that it was a miserable experience. If you are a young hipster then you might enjoy the bar area but if you aren't then toy will likely be very disappointed. ",2
" This is my favorite restaurant in Nashville now. Great food, great service, great atmosphere. I’m already looking forward to the next seasonal menu.  The Korean Fried Chicken is killer! ",5
" Situated in an out of the way, midst of gentrification neighborhood southeast of downtown, parking was a bit bleak. Friendly welcome and immediate seating. Very energetic (i.e., loud) atmosphere. Crowd ranged from fresh out of college to baby boomer — mostly upper 30s to upper 40s.   Server was prompt and friendly. He knew all the “buzzwords” for describing their various cocktails, but couldn’t tell us what is actually in them, aside from the main spirit — and $13/drink felt steep for glasses of ice with 1-1/2 oz of alcohol.   Food was delivered promptly, hot, and delicious. Portions were very generous.   With tip, we spent just shy of $150 for two apps, two entrees, and three cocktails. Though we enjoyed dinner, it didn’t feel worthy of a $150 dinner. And we’re from New York, so we’re used to high prices. ",3
 The decor was wonderful food was delicious definitely going back ,5
" We thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience last Friday.  The food was delicious and creative and the service was excellent.  The one drawback was the lack of valet parking.  Rain was moving in and we had to park up the hill behind a warehouse.  Other than that, it was great. ",4
 Loved the Food! The wine suggestion was great as was the service ! The noise level was bad! WAy too loud! I would recommend making reservations. ,4
" Wow did we find a hidden gem with Hemingway's!  We were looking for a new place for a casual business lunch and happened upon Hemingway's in our search.  While they do have a limited lunch menu, they have something for everyone.  The entire experience from the welcome at the door to our server to the food was exceptional.  Highly recommended and hope to return for dinner. ",5
" What a great addition to the restaurant scene in Nashville. Cozy atmosphere, excellent food and great service. I'll be back! ",5
" Fun new spot! Creative and tasty cocktails, knowledgeable wait staff, tartare was excellent, as was the Korean chicken.  Will definitely be back. ",4
 Highly suggest the Korean Fried Chicken dish! ,5
 Outstanding food and service.  We had the Duck Confit Poutine and it was fantastic.  Followed by the Roasted Duck and the Chicken and Dumplings.  Both were exceptional.  Save room for dessert as both the chocolate mousse and the key lime pie were spot on.  We will definitely be back. ,5
" A little inconspicuous in its location but quite the place if you're willing to go out of the way to find it.  Imaginative takes on American cuisine its also very proud of the fact that it's a bar.  However, that doesn't take away from the food like some places who concentrate more on one than the other.  Unfortunately,  I didn't partake of any of the cocktails but we did try the Ribeye.  At $75 we quickly identified it as an entrée my wife and I should share and It was quite enough for both of us.  So, at $75 you'd expect them to knock a steak out of the park.  Well they do!  Sort of.  Unlike many steak restaurants, what you're paying for is just the steak.  Here, it's a whole meal that comes with brussel sprouts and onion rings -- oh and did I mention this is a bone-in ribeye?  So, what you get is basically a whole meal for 2 for that price.    Although it wasn't very busy when we arrived, the bar was pretty full and the restaurant was too by the time we left.  They do take reservations which I recommend.  Thank you Hemingway's for ""getting it""! ",4
" Saturday night dinner out: innovative cocktails, tasty entrees, dining service was slow at first but improved as the restaurant got busier. Rather noisy. The salmon fish special was delicious but the Brussels sprouts starter was a bit too hot and spicy for my taste. ",4
" Absolutely love this place!!! Erica behind the bar, was wonderful . ",5
 Food was good; above average but didn’t wow us or anything. Very noisy though. Definitely not going to have a romantic date night there. Maybe it’s quieter during the week. Otherwise nice atmosphere and good drinks (strong). ,3
 AMAZING! Every time we eat here the food is phenomenal and our server (Scott) is so fun! ,5
" The service was beyond perfect and the food truly a cut above.  The flavors in all,of our dishes was extraordinary and spot on delicious.  Presentation of the food?  Beautiful.  There were six of us and we all had so,etching different and all dishes were superb.  The chef came out to say hello.  He is self taught and he certainly learned from some masters.  Honestly each dish was unique in presentation and flavor and perfect for each one.  Best food we had in Nashville by far. ",5
" My husband and I have always enjoyed Silo, so we were looking forward to Hemingways.we took another couple and all loved our dishes. The table favorite was the Korean fried chicken. The menu is not large, but our sense is that everything they do, they do well. ",5
" Hemingway's is such a cute little neighborhood gem. They have a great cocktail list and the food was pretty spectacular. I highly recommend the mussels, mushroom soup, and chicken and dumplings. The etoufee was also quite good (but I'm pretty picky about my etoufee and it needs some crusty bread to go along with it)! For drinks try the Stranger to None--delicious! The restaurant is super cute, a little loud, but great for a date night with some people watching. Friendly wait staff--seems like they are still finding their stride, but all in all this is a great spot I will be sure to visit again! ",4
" We were very pleased with the ambiance and setting within the restaurant.  Noise panels have been installed to help keep the noise at a minimum.  The menu choices were good as well as the prices.  The  greeters were organized and professional, but I would have preferred a bit more sophistication from the server.   Our meal was very good.  Other than peanuts on the kale salad, we were very happy with the presentation and quality.  I thought another type nut would have been much more appropriate for the restaurant.  I think of peanuts being served in the bar, not on a nice salad. ",4
 Awesome food and cocktails! ,5
" Awesome place for a date. Great food and wine, nice ambiance. You can easily have a conversation while enjoying the wonderful food. Wait staff is very knowledgeable.  Had a wonderful time. ",5
 The lamb chops and charcuterie/cheese plate were amazing the sangria was just right actually everything on the menu was amazing! ,4
" Food, service and environment were all amazing!!!! Shout out to dax our sever who was great! ",5
 Good Paella and great wine selection and sherried mushroom rice cake appetizer! ,4
" I was very disappointed.   Had been here quite a few times before but menu has changed, they’ve stopped using authentic Spanish names for the food and portions are much smaller.   I don’t know if I will go back.  So sad ",3
 This tapas bar has excellent food. All the dishes taste different and they are very well made. It's a surprise gem in Denver ,4
" Way over priced. Bare bones service. Portions for all 4 courses were jokingly small. Dinner was too fast; a $200 dinner should not be over in less than 30 minutes. The butternut squash soup was delicious but literally only about 3 ounces. The three sea scallops served were sadly only 2-3x the size of bay scallops, but tasty. The servers and ambiance were nice, but you could tell the servers were almost tripping over each other near the tables and I over heard one poor server having to inform two guests that they were improperly sat in someone else’s reserved table and needed to be moved (that should fall to the host, not the server!). Also as a guest trying to enjoy service, I shouldn’t be privy to that. For the price of $75 pp I (we) expected better but we were good sports about it all. Improvements could include: complimentary house bread w/ OO &amp; BV or the equivalent, price includes one drink per person and suggested pairings, price includes gratuity and don’t take so may reservations all at 7:15. ",2
" We went to this restaurant for mine and my sister's birthday. I was really interested to try a tapas place after some previous visits to Spain. The food here was great and there were some creative options. They also had a great wine list. However, the service was very mediocre and their cocktails were WAY overpriced for what they poured. I would give this place another try and hope for a better waitress, but I would do so for a light lunch instead of a full meal, since the plates are pretty pricey for the small portions. ",4
 We had a great dinner here.  The service was excellent and all of the small plates we shared were delicious.  We loved the cozy private booth. ,5
" I love this place! Food is always amazing. Great to go with a group so you can sample many different tapas. Servers are great! Really enjoy their spanish gin &amp; tonic.   I have had their entrees a few times and find them a little underwhelming, however tapas and drinks are perfection and fun! ",5
 Good selection of tapas.  Loved the chicken and garbanzos. ,4
" 9th Door used to be one of my favorite Denver restaurants. It has really gone down hill. The food is just OK. The recipes have changed for everyone of my favorite dishes, if they weren't removed from the menu completely. It seems I'm not the only one who's disappointed in the decline because the restaurant was empty. I won't be returning. ",4
 Great spot for tapas! ,5
" We all ordered paella - seafood, the chicken, and the vegie.  We all thought our different types were delicious.  The suggested wine worked out very nice.  We sat in a booth which made our dinner seem very private and quiet. We would recommend and go back! ",4
" Another great experience at the 9th Door.  Loved nearly all of the dishes we tried.  Our favorite was the stuffed piquillo peppers.  Our least favorite was the shrimp with chorizo and grits; the chorizo used on this dish was far too tough and thick to be paired with the delicate shrimp and grits.  Overall, a delicious meal with great service. ",5
" My wife and I have gone twice, and while it’s not our all time favorite, you could never regret spending an evening here. ",4
 Good experience but one item we had I was not very impressed. Expensive item and it was not very good.  I have had much better lamb shank  At other restaurants and it was not nearly as expensive . Server was very attentive. Nice table  And ambiance. We spent a boatload I was hoping they would take off the lamb shank after I mentioned it was not very good but alas they did not ,4
" It seems that the menu is not as extensive as it used to be, and not quite as interesting.  Still it's very enjoyable,  nice ambiance, and a good date spot.  I would like to see a few more reasonably priced wine glass selections as well. ",4
" Awesome service, great food. I wish the tapas had a portion for four people.  Perfect if you’re going with three ! ",4
" It's always a delight to come to the 9th Door!  I always enjoy the food and the experience.  It's been a while since I've been there, but it's still top notch.  My only complaint is that the waiter new nothing about the wine list, so it would have been helpful to have a little more explanation for the blends. ",4
 We were very excited to try to the tapas and heard good things from other reviews &amp; friends of ours. We went for dinner with some friends and ordered a few tapas and a paella. We weren't completely impressed with the food for the price. We decided the ninth door is much better suited for happy hour rather than a full dinner. Definitely would recommend for happy hour! ,3
 I love this place. Not very crowded. Great value. Best place in Denver for a first drink or first date. ,5
 Fabulous tapas and a good wine list.   Ambiance was relaxing ,5
" The tapas came out incredibly fast (almost too fast - at least pretend it's made to order). All the food tasted good, though two items weren't temperature appropriate (the goat cheese balls were cold in the center, despite being fried, and the beef medallions, mashed potatoes and asparagus spears were ALL lukewarm and had clearly been forgotten for awhile before they came out). I tried three different glasses of wine (don't judge) none notable, all mediocre for the price. The service was efficient, if not overly friendly. The ambiance was fun, lots of red throughout. We had a nice time, I'd go back, but only to sit at the bar at happy hour vs at a table for a dinner date. ",4
" Food was decent, but the flavor was lacking. Would recommend the pear rolls, the sealed scallops and the chocolate mousse.  The shrimp and grits were okay, but the grits were too runny with an excessive amount of oil. The steak medallions were burnt on the outside, but delicious once you cut off the charred pieces. The mashed potatoes had quarter sized peices of onions which was disappointing.  All in all the service was great and the drinks were strong. Would try again. ",3
" 9th Door was good, as always, but am really missing their old menu items and the variety they used to have! (especially the Spanish meatballs and fried avocado!) ",4
 Tasty food and good service.  Enjoy a changing menu with lot of fun options to choose from.  It was quite for a Thursday night but very enjoyable. ,5
 Very tasty food ..portions for the price are to small . Service was good . I thought it was  to pricey and probably won't return . ,4
" Fantastic!  We were celebrating a Birthday, but I could eat here weekly.  Great fun!  Great service!  Great food! ",5
 First time coming to the 9th door... very nice atmosphere.. It was dinner date with old friends.. playing catch up.. And they also loved the place .. and the wait staff was very professional.. And kudos for the bartender to the strawberry mojito ❤️❤️ ,5
 Very strange. We were told entirely under new ownership and everything would be changing a couple of days later. But everything on the menu now was sub par. ,2
" Disappointed in our meal.  The staff was friendly and the location was nice but that doesn’t make up for poor quality food and mediocre sangria.  The chili with goat cheese was bland, the dates were dry, the pork ribs were also dry and seemed smothered in sauce to cover it up.  Worst of all was the paella.  The rice was burned at the bottom and undercooked on top,  while the clams and mussels were fresh - the chicken, sausage, and shrimp seemed reheated and dried out.   Would never visit again. ",1
 The food really tasted great! There’s just not much of it. Petite bites. If they would add 30% more it would make it a decent value.  The restaurant is a very nice place and the service was excellent. They also make good drinks - but expensive. ,3
 Engagement/birthday ,4
 Great selection of tapas.  The stuffed peppers and the dates were amazing.  Everything was delicious and unique. ,5
" I put a more thorough review on Yelp, but the short version is that the new ownership kept the name and premise of tapas, but dropped the spirit and quality of the food and wine. It is basically not what it once was. Now they serve chain restaurant quality food at unique restaurant prices. ",2
 The first thing that comes to mind was our server Danny..he just gets it. Me as a former waiter can say that he simply just gets it! Awesome job! Food was fantastic! Coming back soon. ,5
" We really enjoy tapas and the tapas at The 9th Door were delicious. We sat at the bar. The bartender was attentive and helpful but not intrusive. My only concern was that the portion sizes were very small, even for tapas. We had 7 plates for 2 of us and my husband was still a bit hungry . If you are looking for a tapas meal ( and are hungry), I’d recommend ordering a main course and 2-3 tapas and share everything. ",4
" SERVICE Was timely but the server didn’t think so, and seemed rushed and stressed. Food was very good. Drinks were very good too. Reserved on open table but then the restaurant is seat your self so reservation kinda pointless. ",4
" One of 5 tables sat in the entire restaurant right by the door. Every time the door opened, a big breeze came through. Have a large curtain that can close to prevent this table from feeling this. Said they would not close it. Ordered a round of drinks. Asked for any other table to which they replied “we are fully booked”. I love the food here and have been many times. They did not even offer to comp our drinks when we let them know we would be leaving. There were many, many open tables. I have worked in the restaurant industry for 6 years and this should not have been an issue. It was obvious to our group that we were placed in someone’s section and they did not one to move us out of that section. I even checked open table when we were walking out the door to see reservations available for the 4 following  15minute increments. Very disappointed that we will not be coming back. ",1
 Again they don't use open table. I was turned away when I showed up. ,1
 We sat in the patio in front of the fireplace. It was romantic and great. We both had the specials and were quite pleased. Great waitress too! ,5
 Always great. One of my go to places for fresh and never disappointing food. ,5
" Awesome food and service, everything was delicious and good choice of beers and wine. ",5
 Off The Hook consistently delivers delicious food with a really great atmosphere.  They have recently revamped their menu and have added even more great options.  We always LOVE the lobster mac and cheese as well as the grilled oysters.  Highly recommend this spot. ,5
 Delicious food and great service. Love the swings! ,4
" music through speakers way too loud; wait staff continued to rush us--wanted to turn over the tables, apparently ",1
 Great seafood spot hidden in Astoria. Loved the food and service. I've been to Barbados and this is what it reminded me of with a modern twist. Excellent Rum list ,5
" Everything was delicious and reasonably priced. Great for sharing, highly recommend ordering a few appetizers for the table. ",4
 Mom's birthday ,5
" The server was wonderful! He was super polite, knowledgeable and friendly. We were very satisfied with the food. The catch of the day (sea bass) was both exquisite, and well presented. The generous portion of skirt steak was cooked perfectly and just melted in your mouth. My only complaint is the lobster roll was a bit pricey for the portion, but it was tasty nonetheless. The baked apple dessert was incredible!! You must try it. Overall, we loved it and can't wait to come back! ",5
" We went here with our children to celebrate my husband birthday. we had a great dining experience. our server and our food were both excellent. We started out buy sharing various appetisers, including raw and grilled oysters and alligator meatballs and mussells. all were great. Everyone enjoyed their dinner. Great fish and chips and great lobster rolls. We will be going back ",5
" The oysters were meh, the jerk Brussels sprouts were barely seasoned, and my fish and chips were soggy as hell.  My cocktail was tasty but very small.  My friend had the lobster roll which she liked, so there's that... ",2
" Small, cute place in astoria. The Food was good but very over priced for what you get. ",3
 Awesome place will definitely be back... ,5
" Both the food and service were fantastic. It was a nice place to sit down and catch up with a friend. It wasn't too pricey.  It's a small place but it wasn't too crowded, but we did go on  a Wednesday night. ",5
" A little loud, but food was exceptional.  The chowder was delicious, and they somehow managed to lighten up a crab cake so that it wasn't as dense crab cakes usually are.  We also had the scallops, which were delicious. ",4
" We tried oysters and mofongo. It was tasty but I was expecting more for a $18 mofongo. The atmosphere is regular but because there was not so much people, I appreciated the quaintness of the place. Nothing bad, nothing exceptional but I will recommend it. ",3
 Really enjoyed the brunch here. Flavorful and filling without being too heavy! Great seafood options not available anywhere nearby!! ,4
 food and wait service excellent pleasant seafood dining atmosphere ,5
 Love the clams. Lobster roll. Mussels. Good service. Great food. Wish it was closer to home ,4
 Everything was great! One thing though don't order the Bloody Mary! I think it's the worst yet. ,4
" Second time eating here, food is consistently good. However, last time I was there I went for lunch mid-week. Service was good until three loud male regulars came in, ordered hard liquor, then proceeded to slam back their drinks while loudly complaining about their paralegal jobs using colorful language. They obviously knew the owner and the waiter virtually ignored me while fawning all over these idiots. Part of a good dining experience for me is the ambiance, and this just ruined it for me. Not sure I'll be coming back. ",3
 They have great specials daily. My favorite is the clams on Thursdays. From what I understand I have the record 8 dozen raw clams 2 weeks in a row in one seating each time. I'd like my name up and see if someone would like to beat me. Lobster roll is delicious - not over run with mayo. Alligator balls are ok. The brunch is delicious. Service is sweet and attentive. I have to save more money for my next record of clams. Off the Hook I will be back. ,4
 Excellent food at reasonable prices.  Very good find in a local spot. The menu ranges from creative to old school eating. ,5
" Came here for last-minute dinner on a summer Friday night.  The food is good -- nothing that will blow your mind, but it's nice to have a moderately-priced seafood option in Astoria besides Taverna Kyclades. I had clam chowder and the grilled salmon dish.  I like the rustic decor inside and also like outdoor seating options as well. I wish there menu was a little bigger. I'd like to try some raw bar selections next time! ",4
 One off the best dining experience I've ever had!!true gem!i highly recommend this place to everyone!oh and don't forget to ask for the alligator meatballs!!! ,5
 Great place! The seafood was perfect service was great had a great time. The drinks are pricey though $15 for a vodka and seltzer other than that would totally recommend this neighborhood gem! ,4
" The food was excellent but the service was a little slow. Waitress spent a lot of time talking to her customers at  the individual tables she was serving. Me and my husband thought we waited for our bill a long time. However, due to the quality of the food we would go back again. Please note I booked the reservation through Open Table but when we arrived the hostess   said they did not have our reservation. ?? ",4
" Came in 45min before closing for a quick drink and some oysters and was met with the poorest of attitudes.  Asked for bottled sparking water with lime and got a seltzer with ice and lemon.  The male waiter seemed so annoyed we were there to spend money in the establishment that he worked at.  He was short and Kurt with his tone and words.  Was so turned off by the service I didn't even order my drink after taking a minute to decide what I wanted.   It's too bad. The food is decent here, but the attitude isn't. ",3
" The service was the best thing about the visit.  I would never get the Las Vegas roll again.  The middle of the Las Vegas roll was tiny, and it was surrounded by a huge amount of somewhat mushy rice.  There was so much rice I gave up on eating it at the end and just picked out the middle of the roll, which I have never had to do before.  We also tried the Lily Blossom roll, which smelled very strongly of fish.  It came with a slice of lime on the top, but the slices were too thick and still had the rind attached which made it bitter.  We arrived early for our reservation (less than an hour), and notified the host so we could be marked as present.  They still marked us as missing the reservation, and we had to contest it through Open Table, where it was eventually corrected. ",2
 They changed the menu since we last visited. We were disappointed that they no longer had Peking duck 🦆 ,5
 This was by far the most fun experience we had six people and they each ordered a roll and a main course ALL of it was so good and well plated  thank you out server was terrific ,5
" Our waitress was exceptional!!!!!! We were a party of 8 for an 81st Birthday celebration and she made our experience very happy and memorable, even though she had to do 3 separate checks!!!! ",5
 The appitiezers and soup were very good...the entree could have done without. The main problem for me is the hostess or front of house the lady is always rude and unfriendly every time I go. Not the first experience you want to receive when you go out to eat. ,3
" We used the website and drive 45 minutes to arrive at our reservation time, only to be told the restaurant had closed early. ",1
" the staff went above and beyond to accommodate our large party as well as prepare something special for our birthday gal. They were friendly, attentive, welcoming and professional from start to finish and I truly appreciated their customer service. Food and drinks were delicious, I am vegan and was able to find plenty of options. Thanks Ume for the wonderful experience, would definitely return! ",5
" Came for our birthday.  The fried sushi came out cold, the happy family meal came out cold, the ramen was luke warm, and the pho noodles were undercooked and cold (even though we waited an hour an a half for the pho).  It wasn't a good first experience in regards to the food.  Their saving grace was the very kind and sweet server who was very helpful and patient throughout the whole meal. ",2
 Not worth the money. All you can eat sushi was gross. The crab puffs were about the only good thing. ,2
" Great happy hour specials, awesome selection of sushi. ",4
" We were a group of 10 combining dinner with a reunion picnic meeting.  Our table was kind of in the back along a banquettes.  We had an amazing waitress...unfortunately I don't have her name.  She was OUTSTANDING!!!  Friendly, helpful, knowledgeable, fun, patient.  Couldn't have been better in any aspect.  Food was delicious too, but SHE will bring us back to UME.  Thank you for asking. ",5
" Food was uninspiring, with skimpy ingredients and bland. Oh, and over priced. ",3
" Me and my girls went to celebrate my daughter's birthday and her best friend, we had a blast and our server Chi was excellent!!...2 of the 4 of us are sushi eaters and the other not so much, so she gave us great suggestions and we all enjoyed our meal with 100%!!!...her personality was great she was funny and helpful. Definitely coming back again! ",5
 We went for an anniversary. The Sushi was good and the service was great! ,5
" This is one of my favorite restaurants in Tucson which is why I picked it for my Birthday dinner. We usually have a great meal with great service but this time we were VERY disappointed in the service, especially because it was a special occasion. Managment seemed somewhat apologetic but was definitely not the fun occasion I was hoping for. The food has been consistently good for years now, but it goes to show you how the quality of the server can definitely make or break your meal. ",2
" The hostess, informetd me that I while in the restaurant,  we wouldn't smell cigarette smoke.   WE DID.  That only contributed to our horrible dining experience.  Our waitress was helpful. The chicken was over cooked.  The sushi was good.  We will not be returning. ",3
 My only comment....I requested a booth and was told the servers weren't ready for the booth area. :Disappointing. ,4
 Like all the other reviews said horrible service. I had to clear my own party's plates. The service is soooooo slow reservations at 6:45 didn't leave restaurant till 9pm ugh we wanted to gamble and have more drinks way before then. My friend got the tuna sushi roll tuna was brown she sent it back and didn't get anything else that threw her off. Don't take chances on sushi 🍣 ever. The other food was fine not great but fine. Next time little Mexico restaurant before getting to the casino for sure! ,3
 Server was great but my steak and lobster meal was not worth $38. Steak and lobster were burnt and dry. ,4
" Customer service was horrible. The sushi did not taste fresh at all and made us lose our appetite. Plus side to the whole night, the manager took the sushi orders off of the bill. I dont recommend this place for all you can eat sush. ",1
" We truly enjoyed the food, service, and atmosphere at Ume.  Prices are comparable to any good Asian cuisine in Tucson, and the variety on the menu makes it worth the drive. We were running late for our reservation and called to alert them.  They were very accommodating and greeted us with enthusiasm for our arrival. Our table was very nice, and we were well-taken care of throughout our meal. ",5
 The food was delicious! The service was very poor.  I would recommend this restaurant IF you have a lot of time and don't care about good service. ,3
 I was charged an 18% fee because i had my daughter that is 2 years old ,1
 Our meals are always quite good at Ume's. The Chef prepared a special request for me that was no longer on the menu As always very good. Katherine ,4
" First of all I almost never leave reviews. I am in the service industry myself and know first hand how one upset persons review can affect business, but I had to write this. I was nervous from the start reading others reviews about the incompetent staff, from the receptionist not having reservations in the system to the slow servers. I made the reservations through open table requesting a nice secluded table as we were celebrating a big anniversary. We arrived at the reservation time and there was no receptionist to be found. We stood there for a few minutes before she appeared. Luckily the reservation was there and we had a nice booth at the back of the restaurant. The server was pretty prompt. We ordered the appetizer sampler plate to share. This happened to be the best part of the meal, unfortunately. We were there during happy hour so I ordered a drink off of the happy hour menu. It was good. My main meal was sushi. I am a huge sushi fan and don't get to eat it that often, but I am aware of great, ok and bad sushi. I ordered the Vegas roll off the happy hour menu and the ex roll off the main menu. I should have just gone to the grocery store and got sushi for half the price or Sushi 10's half price happy hour. The quality stunk. The Vegas roll fell completely apart, and I ended up just eating the insides. The ex roll was super mushy and had to be eaten with a fork and my fingers. The flavor or both were just egh.... My husband was ok with his food. The wonton soup he got was enormous, enough for a few people. So my suggestion, don't go for sushi here unless you have pretty low expectations for it. There are plenty of better sushi places in town including the grocery store. And by the way I was charged full price for my happy hour items. I didn't feel like it was even worth my time to argue with them over the price.  Though it makes me wonder how many other people don't look at their itemized receipts and realize they aren't being charged the right price. ",3
 food was great I had the sampler appetizers it was delicious my friend had the pho soup &amp; salad portions were good very satisfied with our food we will return to try something different thank you ,5
" We were seated right away and told we may have to wait a bit because they were running behind but that was not the case.  Our server was with us almost immediately, she was prompt, attentive and over all very nice! We enjoyed our meal and the time in the restaurant. ",5
 Our server was very friendly and attentive. We had a variety of sushi ( the playboy is my fav). ,5
 The food was excellent.  It was prompt and came out hot.  The portion sizes were more than adequate.  The service quality was not up to standard but not horrible.  Our waitress did not check back until we were almost done with our meals and we were in need of a fork and napkin.  We had to wait to eat and summon someone else down. ,4
" The service was so-so. My friend had to ask for the dessert menu twice, then someone finally came out to verbally tell us that the only dessert available was mochi ice cream. Our dessert order was botched, and the mochi was hard and fell apart. Not impressed and not going back. ",3
" terrible service, food not as good as usual, very upset about the failed mother's day lunch ",3
" Service was horrible.  6:30 reservation, not seated till 6:45. Waiter didn't come to table until after 7pm, didn't get first appetizer till 7:10. Staff was not friendly and the restaurant wasn't even that busy. Food was fair/good overall, but the service was so poor I would not return. ",2
" Food was great, service was unbelievably slow. Getting seated with a reservation took 15 minutes and getting our drink orders took longer and then getting the drinks themselves were 20 minutes after they had been ordered.  That being said, very kind staff and phenomenal food ",4
 We were pleasantly surprised with our lunch at Ume. All in all it was very good experience.  The fact that the restaurant was carpeted enabled the four of us to have a conversation as I am hearing inpaired. ,4
" Absolutely TERRIBLE.  Sushi choices for all you can eat were only 5 rolls, of which 3 were so spicy they hurt the mouth.  Bad choices, bad food, poor quality.  Sushi rice was overworked to point of being a paste.  DO NOT EAT THERE, NOT A GOOD ASIAN RESTAURANT.  Management needs to find someone who knows what they are doing.  VERY EXPENSIVE and spoiled birthday celebration.  We are locals but will never eat in this venue again.   Service was awful, had to ask staff three different times to find our waitress...We eat at Casino Del Sol often, has been wonderful in the past, but this was a huge disappointment and a very expensive lesson.  Do not eat there. ",1
 The food was good and people friendly. Service was slow. ,3
" food not to bad, sushi good, service can sometimes be a little slow but nothing that ruins the evening ",4
" Reservations online were very easy to make. Once we arrived, we were seated promptly in a very nice preferred seating booth. Service and food were great! ",5
 Food was good. Peking Duck and a couple of appetizers. Service was lame. Waiter was pleasant. Brought Peking Duck. Didn't make first set of pancakes like normal. Didn't have spoon for hoisin sauce. Didn't refresh silverware. Amateurish. ,4
" Abysmal Made reservation on Open Table, restaurant refused to seat as per request for a booth. Instead sat half table half booth even though there were plenty of open booths.  Hostess was clearly unhappy with her job and life, truly worst hostess I've ever encountered. Food was sub par for the environment and price. The time it took to get the unimpressive food was also far too long. The waitress only came to the table 3 times, to get the orders, to bring the food and to drop the check, find a different line of work dear. Would not ever send anyone to this restaurant, absolutely horrible. ",2
" Excellent food, service and the atmosphere is perfect! A must for every NYC visit. ",5
 Chairs in the dinning room are very uncomfortable. From NYC - don’t think I would go back. ,3
" Last time we were in N.Y.C my wife meet Sting outside the Tavern, so since that day I promised her she would eat there some day. That day was this week and the tears are still in her eyes as she was over come with joy being there. The food and service were great. We will be back. I thank you for allowing me to make her wish come to life.. Regards.. ",5
 Absolutely amazing and a must do in New York City! Service was exceptional. Our waitress was probably one of the best we have ever had at any restaurant. Cannot wait to go back! ,5
" Absolutely wonderful service. Spinach bacon salad was superb. steak a little tough but tasted good. dessert was also delicious. but most impressive was the service, at one point I looked up and saw a steak knife and hadn't even noticed it being placed ",5
" Fancy!. We were seated in the corner facing the courtyard. The dining room is made of clear glass walls so we had a wonderful view. This place is classy. We thoroughly enjoyed the experience. We went for restaurant week NYC. For starters the wife had garlic shrimp about 6 pieces NICE!!!! I had the black bean soup, very tasty, We both had the codfish as a main entree. It was also tasty. For desert The wife had cremebrulee and I had carrot cake. Both also delicious. Peroni beers were $8 and 1 bottle of NA beer $9. All in all a great experience. Spencer was attentive and friendly. Total bill $120 plus tip. ",5
" Birthday lunch, service first class, location amazing, food value for money. ",4
" A NYC Staple, Tavern on the Green did not disappoint! It was as charming on the inside as it was on the outside and the food was surprisingly good (I had seen some meh reviews) but it was really good and we were stuffed! ",5
 Restaurant week with friends ,4
" It was a splendid lunch. Kind serving, great food! Would love to visit again when I come back to NY!! ",5
" We attended during NYC food week and enjoyed a fabulous lunch and wine pairing.  We sat in the atrium and had a great view of Central Park.   The meal portions were generous, both the skirt steak and the monkfish dishes were delicious.  The chocolate creme brulee was the ultimate way to finish our meal and would highly recommend it.   Our server was attentive and all of the staff were friendly.  I would highly recommend stopping in and enjoying all that this iconic New York restaurant has to offer. ",5
" We had excellent service from Ethan!  We were in NYC for a couple of days and have always wanted to have lunch in Central Park, was a fantatic choice........ ",5
" Enjoyed our lunch !   We were just visiting NYC, loved having the carriage ride through the park after lunch. ",5
 Visiting New York for the day and couldn’t resist a chance to eat at Tavern on the Green during restaurant week.  Did the lunch meal with wine pairing and it was just fantastic. ,5
 We were celebrating my brother-in-law’s 65th Birthday. He and my sister live in Dallas though they both grew up in NY area. The restaurant was perfect for our celebration and your restaurant week menu with wine pairings was both delicious and a great value. Service was terrific and front house personnel friendly and welcoming. We’ll be back!!! ,5
 Very friendly and fun waiter service. Informal but professional. Good and tasty options for the NYC Restaurant Week too. ,4
" Bar is really nice, dining room and total environment are very unique - of all three us dining, we each agreed the food was fair and while we would return for drinks in the bar, we would not eat in the restaurant again. ",4
 Love what they've done to the place! Excellent food and dining experience.  We have not been to Tavern in over 15 years. Very updated with some hints of traditional looks towards the front of the house.  We dined during Restaurant Week and did not feel as though we missed out on food or experience ,4
 Great service and food. Everything that we hoped for when we imagined dining here. ,5
" Great location and the service was excellent.  I was disappointed in the menu options, or lack of.  Very limited menu. ",4
 Cute date with my friend ,5
" Absolutely loved it! Prettiest spot in Central Park, excelent views and service, very good food. Excelent choice for brunch. Totally recommended. ",5
 Amazing!!!! ,5
 Extraordinary dining experience.  We enjoyed a great brunch with the family were appreciative of the great staff and service. Can’t wait to enjoy the outside dining this spring! ,5
 Lane was our server and she (and everyone else we came in contact with) was 5 Star! Best lunch visit ever! Thank you so much! ,5
" Quintessential New York restaurant! Tavern on the Green is a must, even if it's just to fulfill your bucket list.  Breaking down the review as follows:   Reservations: One of the people from our party was late but they seated us anyway since most of the party was there. This is a plus when we are talking about NYC restaurant rules of not seating everyone until your party is there since sometimes you miss out on a good table.  Tavern on the Green also had a beautiful bar and lounge area so waiting there with a mimosa is hardly an inconvenience!   Ambiance: I love the ambiance of this place. The fireplace by the bar is so cute and the long, plush red coach is Instagram-worthy!  The main dining area has and indoor-outdoor feel since they have a nice open skylight ceiling.   Service: Our server was very nice and attentive even though it was a busy brunch Saturday. We didn't feel rushed by him even though we weren't a complete party when we got seated.   Food: Ok, so this is why they don't have 5-stars. The food was just ok. I'm a foodie so I know my standards are on the high side but the meals we had were pretty plain Janes. I got the steak and eggs and it was a little tough and cold. The eggs were pretty tasty though but overall, the food was ok. The desserts were MUCH better!   So, to answer the net promoter score question: would recommend Tavern on the Green? The answer is YES... especially if you have out of town visitors or celebrating a special occasion. It is a little touristy but hey, we are all tourists in NYC! 😊 ",5
 The service was excellent. The atmosphere is very nice calm and quiet. People are friendly and very welcoming. The food is fresh quick and delicious. Overall great experience. ,5
 Amazing service &amp; food! ,5
 The bread could’ve been a lot softer. It was a little hard ,4
" We were in New York for my birthday weekend and had dinner at Tavern. I requested a table in the bar for the live jazz. The fun was beautiful and fun with people dancing to the music!  It was Restaurant Week, so you had a choice between the 2 menus. Waitress was delightful, but slightly inattentive. ",4
 Ok food nice atmosphere ,4
" Excellent service from the moment we stepped in until we stepped out. Hostess and the rest of the staff at the reservation counter were all great and informative. They also pointed us to their beautiful bar, where we had a drink before being called in for dinner. We were shown to our table with smiles and laughter and not too soon after we were seated our waiter came over to greet us with information about the specials and Restaurant Week Menu. Their soups and wine paring were spot on. Their main courses (short rib and chicken dishes) were very well put together and tasted amazing with the pared wine. If you do not get the carrot cake you would be doing yourself a huge disservice. Great work on the elegant and modern decor and design throughout the Tavern. ",5
" Very friendly staff, great food and atmosphere. Love to come again. ",5
" I was hesitant to return, fond memories of  the paper lantern filled patio and all but the new Decor and ambience did not disappoint. A New York tradition despite some hiccups and an out of towner must! ",5
 Very beautiful lunch.  Classic New York. ,5
" I enjoy the atmosphere, sunshine in, fire on hhh ",5
 I would definately recommend. The service was excellent. The staff very attentive. ,5
 Went for Restaurant Week lunch and the food was very good.  Others ordered off the menu and loved their dishes.  Haven't been there for over a year and was surprised how good the food was. ,4
" Willie our server was delightful and attentive.  The gentleman who refreshed the water, removed used utensils, dishes was wonderful.  Consider both of them as TOTG ambassadors.         Joel and Susie Blum  What a beautiful and historic building!!!!! ",5
" Even though I am a native New Yorker, I had never been here in my life! I came for restaurant week and for a business meeting, and experienced great service. The black bean soup was good, and I loved the codfish which was perfectly cooked and placed delicately on very aromatic fennel. I did the wine pairing and it was wonderful. I will glad return, probably with a larger party. ",5
" We had been to Hemingway's once before, but just for a drink at the bar.  This time, we decided to have dinner here.  My husband and I split the romaine salad, Korean BBQ chicken and the Tagliatelle pasta dish.  I had a gin cocktail and my husband had Hemingway's version of a Manhattan.  Our drinks were excellent and the service was outstanding.  I would rate each of our dishes as good to very good.  The caesar salad was very good.  Liked the Korean BBQ Chicken, but didn't think it was as special as it was touted to be by the waitress (house specialty) and probably wouldn't order it again.  The tagliatelle pasta was also good, but it was pretty oily and there was a large amount of oil left in the bottom of the bowl after we ate it.  We did have a very nice chocolate/ caramel dessert at the end of our dinner which I would recommend.  Would be nice if they had more seafood on the menu.  Scallops were the only seafood entree (fish of the day) I recall being available.  The acoustics in the restaurant don't do enough to diffuse the noise - it was loud where we were sitting.  Would return for the bar, but given the number of other excellent restaurants in Nashville, would probably give those a try before returning for dinner. ",4
 Pleasantly surprised on both drink and food menus. All was perfect !! ,5
 First time at Hemingway's and we loved it.  Food was excellent starting with the crispy Brussels sprouts.  Also tried the beer cheddar soup and it was amazing.  I had the Korean Fried chicken and my husband had the beef stew and both were really good.   Nice to be able to get free street parking too. ,5
" A ""Hideaway"" indeed. I love this place. It's tucked away, in what I can only imagine will be another up and coming area, right outside of downtown Nashville. Great food, AWESOME ambiance, fantastic drinks. We've been to this place twice in the past month and can't wait to return! ",5
" Our server was moderately attentive at first, but he dropped off the face of the planet once our food was served. The food was good - I had the breakfast poutine. It was a bit overpriced, though. The atmosphere was wonderful. I loved the design of the restaurant. I would like to try their other meals. ",4
" Great meal, excellent cocktails.  Our waiter, Anthony, was great.  Very happy with experience and will be back! ",5
" This place is highly overrated. The food is average. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. The alcoholic beverage, pickle Richard is very good, that's it. ",3
" Comfortable and casual, Hemingways delivers delicious entrees and interesting drinks. ",5
 My Roasted Duck Breast was too tough to eat. Others' meals were apparently good. ,3
" The drinks were tasty, the food was unique and tasty, and the place was comfortable and inviting. A enjoyable experience. ",4
" Our first visit won't be our last!  We enjoyed everything about this place.  Location, ambiance, and service were great.  The food was superb.  We split the ribeye (recommended as it is 32oz!) and still had leftovers to take home.  Brussel sprouts were fantastic even heated up the next day.  Anthony took exceptional care of us.  We are not big cocktail drinkers but he took the time to ask what we did like in a drink and gave us the perfect recommendation.  So many places to dine out in Nashville, but this is one NOT to be missed. ",5
" We had a wonderful experience here on our date night last week! Food and service was fantastic!! Too many things we wanted to try on the menu, so we will definitely be back! ",5
" The Scallops were totally OFF.  Smelled and tasted absolutely putrid.  Sent them back and they brought out MORE putrid shellfish then only took $5 off of the bill!    The Korean Chicken was cold and greasy and essentially tasteless.    Furthermore, the creative cocktails were barely average in quality and imagination.    A night and long drive wasted. ",2
 Loved the food. Recommend brunch poutine. Tacos tasty maybe crispier hash browns. The noise was live able because it wasn’t packed but sound panels would make a world of difference in the dining experience. Charming atmosphere. We’ll go back for dinner. ,5
" There for lunch on Weds and dinner on Sat.  Two different groups of people and two different menus.  All wonderful, thanks. ",5
 The most inventive and amazing cocktails ever. Chicken and dumplings was divine though I wish I had that as the appetizer and the butternut squah dish as my entree ;) ,5
 Great new place in a hidden unsuspected area.  Best Pickled Richard drink with pickle juice and blackberry preserves.  So yummy.  Mahi was divine over goat cheese grits!!! Atmosphere was so eclectic with a cosmo vibe!!  I’d definitely go back. ,5
 A bit tricky to find and you have to park on the street which can get crowded. We went to brunch and the door was locked. They let us in after peeking in windows. Then they still didn't unlock the doors. This happened a few more times before they did. Very strange. The food was good. I didn't think anything was unique. They have brunch but don't have lattes or specialty coffee drinks. Just plain black coffee. ,4
" Our new favorite spot! We came here on a date night &amp; had been trying to decide between all the other new restaurants in town to try out. We picked Hemingway's because it had a great cocktail list &amp; delicious menu options for a cold night! It exceeded our expectations! Anthony made our experience exceptional (as always) with great food &amp; wine recommendations. You MUST try the chicken &amp; dumplings- WOW! One of my favorite dishes I've ever had. If you want a cozy spot for a bite with a killer bar &amp; relaxed atmosphere, this is it! Make this your next date night! ",5
 A great buzz in an up and coming neighborhood . Anthony was friendly and provided great servive. Had  the short rib stew and was yummy. Bar was hopping! ,5
" First time in, certainly not the last. The spirits list alone is enough to make the trip worth it (looking at you Pappy). The food was superb and the staff wonderful, even on a busy night. ",5
 Great bar manager... great burger &amp; amazing poutine! ,5
" i went here with some friends and the flavors were a bit too strong with each item i ordered. the beef tartare had WAY too much horseradish on it and the homemade tagliatelle was COMPLETELY over saturated with red peppers. i couldn’t eat it the peppers were so strong ... i can’t say i’ll never go back, but if i do it’ll just be for drinks. i’m not sure they try the food before it leaves the kitchen. which is a bummer. ",2
 Amazing! Best food and atmosphere in the city hands down! ,5
 We ate here New Year’s Eve and although the food was delicious it was ice cold and our cocktail pairings for each course unfortunately were always delayed that we missed them with each course....We did enjoy the food so we do plan to go back on a week night to give it one more shot. ,5
 Food was over-priced. Great ambience. ,3
" Great cocktail list; fair beer list, dominated by locals. Duck poutine and pork belly were quite good as starters. Duck main cooked to perfection . Chicken and dumplings the ultimate comfort food . A really good server (Nathan) coupled with great food can make dining out a memorable experience. We’ll definitely be back. ",5
" Fun place, but very loud. Hard to have a conversation. Interesting &amp; strong drinks. Food was good but very strongly flavored. For example the brussel sprouts were very vingary. Really wanted to but couldn't finish them. Korean fried chicken was quite spicy. I'd go back and try other things next time. ",4
 I just want to say that I have tried to contact them about a situation three times and I’ve got received no want to call me back to messages and one phone message and no return from anybody had a bad experience was so looking forward to it my family was so looking forward to coming down there at a later time we have canceled our plans and soon since I got no response from you guys ,1
" This was not a comfortable experience. From the over salted food to the way the waiter kept trying to rush us out.   This was the first time a server said that they have a reservation coming that will want our table. We had 4 meals, desserts, drinks etc and were expected to jump out of our seats when the check came. It was very awkward. ",3
" First time dining had lunch with co-workers. The ambiance is wonderful, the food is delicious. Hemingway's is definitely going in the dining rotation. Looking forward to having dinner here. ",5
" Pedestrian. It’s sad to see that this place has gone downhill. Used to be special,  it anymore. ",2
 Everything was amazing. Incredible service and food. Will definitely be back. ,5
" Great atmosphere, great food.   Unique location with arcade games, pub menu, great drinks and more.  Highly recommend. ",5
" Great food and service; limited menu, but with excellent choices.  French fries and kale salad were some of the best I've ever had anywhere.  Parking is on the street in a very dicey neighborhood.  I can see why it received the Best of Nashville new restaurant award. ",4
 The food is outrageously good. Like elevated home cooking. Obsessed ,5
 This place is a hidden gem.  The experience was excellent as well as the food quality.    The duck poutine Fries were decadent!  The sea bass entree and the short rib stew were fabulous.   Will definitely return. ,5
 Nathan was an incredible server.  Cocktails were delicious. Great good for great value!! ,5
" We requested a booth and the hostess said it was for a larger party. The entire we were there it sat open until just before we left, and it was sat with a party of 2. Food was really good. Cocktails seemed overpriced. Loved the atmosphere but I think it would have been nice if they designed the space to be broken up a little. ",4
" Good cocktails, food was fine but nothing great.   Need to work on more options -  Our waitress was great!  Nice decor -  need to try again -  we always give restaurants 2 chances! ",3
 As always we had another enjoyable dinner at Baci. ,5
" Enjoyed authentic Italian food, excellent Ravioli and sauce and good Tutti Mare. Our server was responsive and knowledgeable, it did take a while for dessert but all in all would definitely recommend and will return. ",4
" When we arrived, the owner/manager said that reservations made through Open Table got the leftover seats, so we were not able to sit inside of the restaurant, even though there was only one table with patrons. We sat outside.  We were a bit “put off” by the reference of leftover seats, as it made us feel as if we were 2nd class reservations!  We had made the reservations over a week ago! ",3
 Good place but all veal options sold out and we had an 8:00 pm reservation. ,4
 I love a good Italian restaurant but was disappointed by this one. We arrived for dinner at 7:30 and were promptly told that all but 1 of their 5 veal dishes were sold out. (Seems strange that they had enough veal to make saltimbocca but didn't have enough to make marsala.) Our waitress was kind of haughty and inattentive. The food was adequate but not  especially tasty and definitely not worth the price. ,2
" 2nd time we tried this place, loved it the first time and this time was equally perfect. Food and service top notch, prices very reasonable. We will definitely be dining here again. ",5
 Great  dining experience. ,5
" Great food.  Great value.  Only complaint was the wind blasting us in the face each time the door opened.  A better seat would have made it an even better dining experience.  Overall, great for the food, value, service.  We'd go there again and recommend to others. ",4
" Great ambiance, great service, nice portion size, great value. A fun unique place to dine. Great meal and experience. ",5
" On vacation. This restaurant popped up as a recommendation an we were very happy we went. The food was excellent quality prepared with many locally sourced ingredients and very tasty. Our server, an older woman, was very friendly and knowledgeable. They offer a large assortment of daily specials in every plate category. I would say that if you're in Kailua and hungry....go here! ",5
 Great food..Outstanding service..will be returning and bringing friends!!!! ,5
 Good food and service. Fruit flies are annoying. Place needs a good scrub. Windows and sills are filthy. ,3
" Always consistent. Everything flavor filled! Friendly wait staff.  Signature beet salad, special sea bass, truffled gnocchi, luscious Baci Veal. Da Vinci Chianti was memorable. Gelato like Roma’s. Pricey, but memorable. ",5
 We had a good time there. Food was good. Good service. Will come again! ,5
" I've been going to Baci's for years.  Something seems wrong.  Last time it took over an hour to be served.  Everything was unusually slow.  We finished a bottle of wine before the first food arrived.  No explanation, no apology.  This time, the service was somewhat better, but overall it was disappointing.  I used to really enjoy Baci's and went there a couple of times per month, certainly for all special occasions, but it may be time to move on.  There is a lot of competition, but we don't have that many restaurants in Kailua that are really exceptional like Baci's has been. ",3
" We had reservations, and so glad we did. The restaurant filled up quickly. The wine list has many Italian wines, which is great, but lacking Zinfandel, and decent chards. The pear salad was delicious, bruschetta was garlic-filled! Nice dining experience. Salads came out before we were finished with appetizers, and then we waited for our dinners. ",4
 Good Devine. Other diners not so mich ,5
" Even thought the lights went out due to a severe storm, the staff remained composed and we had a wonderful time! ",5
 時間前に入れてくれました。ワインも食事も美味しかった。 賑やかでお客さんの回転も良い。 バスを利用してワイキキに行くには早めに食べて帰れば十分間に合う。 ,5
 Love how the staff goes out of the way for guests!  Thank you Baci! ,5
 Excellent service.  Same staff for several years- that's always a good sign of a great employer. ,5
" My favorite restaurant  in Kailua! Love the wait staff, yummy food, charming... no ka oi! ",5
" Consistently fine Italian dining , personal attention to service and easily reserved through OpenTable. ",4
 Thank you Baci for great food and service.  We really feel like family when we go! ,5
 Fantastic as always.  Loved the three tomato salad. ,5
 Awesome place.  Wonderful food ,5
" It was wonderful as always - we DO hope that once it's under new management, that things will NOT change -everything must remain the same --because change would NOT make us happy campers!! ",5
 Not a good experience. Cold and unfriendly service. The food was pretty terrible. Lack of flavor and authenticity. Rushed through the meal. We were celebrating our 10th anniversary and we couldn’t have picked a more terrible choice! ,2
" My roommate and I have lived in Kailua 6 months now and finally tried this place out. We absolutely loved it! We were seated at an outdoor table on the adorable patio and were promptly greeted with bread and water. Our server took our drink order and read us the specials and we loved our selections of the burrata, truffle gnocchi and chicken piccata. The wine list allowed us to properly dine and even finish with an italian coffee. We will absolutely be back. 10/10 would recommend. ",4
 Always very good food and service!  The best home town non fast food restaurant ‼️ ,5
" Once again Baci has lived up to it's reputation. Fabulous food, great service, nice atmosphere and wonderful desserts...although we always get the cheesecake. We have never has a so-so meal here.  The scallops were wonderful. Although I wish there had been more than 3. ",5
 Great food‼️Jeff was an incredible server!  Always great ,5
 We always go to Baci when there is a special occasion and we also try to go every chance we get. We have been served great food with outstanding service. The experience is totally assume!!! I  leave wanting to go back very very soon. ,5
" Baci is a really nice venue. It was super noisy but to be expected because of the setting. It seemed as though we were somewhat rushed, which was unnecessary. The waiter warmed up after a while when he realized that we were local and just wanted to chill a bit. We wanted to visit without the rush. ",4
 Best restaurant in Kailua. Cozy comfortable and nice ambiance. The food is amazing and the service is outstanding. ,5
 Get the homemade cheese cake and calamari steak! ,4
 Get the New York steak if it's available. Awesome ,5
" The place was really nice and clean. When we first walked in nobody was there to great us and they were other guest also wondering where to go or who to talk to to get a table. I had made a reservation so out table was ready right away that is a plus. The food was amazing, had a lot of wine selections and the service was nice and attentive. They discounted our dessert because it was my birthday so that made it a even better experience. ",5
 It was a very busy Friday night so we did not get seated until about 8pm. We received bread and water right away but it took quite awhile to receive menus from our waiter. I ordered my favorite pasta dish-lobster ravioli with cream sauce which is usually delicious but my sauce was very soupy. My husband had the spinach ravioli special which was excellent. It was also very loud inside this particular evening. Still one of my favorite places in Kailua so we will be back again. Maybe this was just an off night. ,3
" Another wonderful evening at Baci Bistro.  We are always well cared for, the food is tantalizing, and the ambiance delightful.  Mahalo Bill and the staff! ",5
 VERY GOOD BREAKFAST VERY NICE WAIT PERSONAL AND BARTENDERS ,3
 Decent airport hotel restaurant.    Very friendly service and nice atmosphere.   Bar was spatious and lively.    They gave me a complimentary apetizer which was just ok.    Fried calimary would not have been my first choice.    Some were good.  Some greasy and some a bit fishy.     The blue cheese salad with grilled beef was very good.   Beef cooked to order and greens were fresh. ,3
" Great reviews, earned them. Evening meal before flying off to multiple points. Cold beer, interesting drinks, burgers to good italian and seafood. No complaints. ",4
 30日熟成ステーキを食べました。 ボリュームもスゴいですが噛めば噛む程、肉の味が堪能できました。 二人で行きましたが一人がコ－ス料理をたのみ、私がステーキを注文しましたがお腹一杯になりました。 二人ともコ－スにすると食べきれないかもしれないので注意してください。 また、行きたいです。 ,4
" The porterhouse was amazing.  So tender and tasty.  Even better than John Howie, Ruth Chris and Daniel’s Broiler if you have also eaten at those.  The fish and the sauces used also very tasty. ",5
" Great for a steakhouse not much choice for anything else, they were out of a couple of choices of cuts. But what we did have was great, excellent wine list  and service was good ",4
 Fantastic food paired with great service from our server Nicholas.  His wine recommendation with our steak entree helped to elevate the dinner experience further.  Nicholas' wine and cocktail knowledge just made our first time experience here that much better!  Great job all around! ,5
" Best steak I've ever had.  Very expensive but like I said, it doesn't get better. ",5
" Perfect setting, we sat outside which was wonderful. Food was perfect, out of 9 plates everything was perfect! Well worth the money. Wine selection good and our server was knowledgeable about the menu. Great night! ",5
" Pleasant ambience with good location on Waikiki.  Server was great, but multicourse meal was served a bit slowly. The steaks themselves were mouth watering, tender and grilled exactly as requested. Price was in line with finer steakhouses. Overall well recommended. ",4
 Great experience with the family enjoying my wife’s Birthday; it was simply awesome... ,5
 The steakhouse provided a well cooked and very tender steak- one of the best.  We had a reservation but were seated late and the seats are not comfortable- given the meal will take 1 1/2- 2 hours.  It is a little pricey- but what isn’t in Hawaii.  Bring your own cushion or try the patio chairs and it would be a 5++ experience. ,4
" The service was fantastic, friendly without being intrusive, and about the best I've had anywhere.  The food was good, but I""m spoiled by the way Ruth's Chris serves their steaks sizzling hot, and missed that with my petite filet.  It was perfectly cooked and melted in my mouth.  The Ahi special appetizer was delicious, as were our salads.  The biggest disappointment was the sides...the garlic mashed potatoes were luke warm at best and tasted kinda like the dehydrated flakes, we each only had one bite, they were that bad.  The 'farm to table' veggies were tasteless and unimaginative for a restaurant of this caliber.  My lychee martini was delicious, and my under-21 daughter said the li-hing lemonade was the best she's ever had.  My husband enjoyed his sangria.  All in all, a very pleasant dining experience, with a lovely sunset view over Waikiki.  I recommend this restaurant. ",4
" The food was amazing. We got the Mahina set menu. There was so much food! We were expecting closer to tasting menu servings for at least some of the courses, but they were full sized. By the time dessert came, we weren’t sure none of us knew how we would be able to even taste it. However, it looked so good we could not resist. Definitely recommend. ",5
 Wes was so attentive and really knew the menu. It was a great birthday dinner and we will definitely be back! Thank you Wes for a great time! ,5
 60を超えたジイさん4人.憧れのハワイでのゴルフの後、ステーキをガッツリ食べてワインも美味しく頂き楽しい時間を過ごしました。日本語が話せるスタッフではありませんでしたが、当方の拙いジャパニーズイングリッシュに我慢強く付き合ってくれました。とても感じの良いお店でした。英語に自信の無い方にでもお勧めです。次回も必ず行くと思います。 ,4
 It’s my favorite steak place on the island. They have a 30 day Dry aged Rib Eye which is my go to. The Au Gratin Potatoes are a favorite also. The wine selection is very nice and reasonably priced.  Although I usually bring my own special selection for a reasonable corkage fee. The service is exceptional. The staff is very attentive and helpful.  Very aloha! ,5
" Had a very pleasurable evening.  Our server, Wes, was very good.  The food was prepared very well.  My husband had the 30-day dry aged bone in rib-eye  which was so tender and tasty.  I had the fish of the day.  Both our portions were very generous.  We could only eat half our entrée (we had an appetizer and salad to start).  We requested our favorite, Sansei's Granny Smith Apple Tart dessert; we were happy they accommodated our request. ",5
 リブアイステーキおいしかったです。 3名で リブアイステーキ　600ｇ ホウレンソウのソテー 旬なお魚料理 アヒのお刺身 サラダ とワイン1本とビール1本でチップいれて２００＄チョット CPもいいと思います。 おすすめです ,4
" The beef is terrific.  My rib eye was a great cut, perfectly prepared.  My wife had the filet, and says it melted in her mouth. ",5
 Nice selection. Shrimp scampi appetizer was terrific! Steak tasty and tender.  Au gratin potatoes were amazing! ,4
" Loved our meal at DK.  We dined early and it was romantic.  As the night wore on, a lot of large groups were coming in and it got a bit noisy.   Our server was knowledgeable and we enjoyed our meal ",5
 High prices and nothing out of the ordinary. Average food and noisy. Would not recommend. Average at best. ,3
 Best meal we have had in Waikiki! Service was fantastic and the food was amazing.  Definitely will be back when in Waikiki again. ,5
 worth it the price and some more:) ,4
 Great atmosphere.  Delicious food and well-seasoned steaks.  Definitely a good date place. ,5
 Good Cost Performance! ,5
" My first dry aged beef experience couldn’t have been any better. Great food, staff was amazing! Our waiter was very attentive and gave great recommendations ",5
 Very impressed with quality and preparation of the food. Everyone enjoyed their steaks and the side dishes. ,5
" Went to DK Steakhouse to celebrate a birthday.  Food and service was excellent! Our waiter, David was so friendly and made our evening special and memorable!  Would definitely go again! ",5
" This place is phenomenal for the steaks. My husband and I both had the 31 day dry aged rib eye, that was amazing. The sides were very plentiful and one can feed two people. Had leftovers for breakfast and lunch the next day. ",5
 熟成肉を食べに家族でいきました。メニューには15日、30日の熟成肉がありますが、そのほか、45日の熟成物もありました。日本語メニュー、日本語の話せるスタッフもおり安心でした。 ,4
 I have eaten at Hy’s steak house and decided to try DK steak house. I think between the two Hy’s wins. Atmosphere is a more elegant Chicago style steak house and great caviar appetizer ,4
 カラカウア通り沿いの席（テラス席）で、ディナーをいただきました。 事前に口コミ情報等で、テラス席が良いと確認をしていましたので、サンセット時間（18時頃）にあわせて、17時45分の予約でテラス席をリクエストしていました。 大正解でした！ 天気も良く、夫婦二人で絶景のサンセット眺めながらのディナーでした。（オープンテーブル様、有難うございます。） 総合評価の4は、オーダーを間違えられたからです。 ステーキの味については、もっと美味しいステーキハウスもありますが、コストパフォーマンスを考えると、上々だと思います。 必ず、サンセット時間にあわせて、天気も確認し テラス席をリクエストすることを、おすすめ致します。 ,4
 Very underwhelmed for what was anticipated. The steak had fat unrendered and was undercooked. The service was only so-so. A lot of words with not much action. Had to asked a few times for bread to be served which is supposed to be served fairly soon after ordering drinks. A moderate experience at best. Don't recommend unless you are into a commercial experience. ,2
 本当に美味しいステーキでした！ ,5
 Our server was great ' food was really good. Made our birthday and New Years celebration  one to remember ,5
 From the time we checked in and left service was awesome!   The food was delicious.  The steak was huge.   Natalia our waitress was great.  My husband had a great birthday dinner.  We will return again. I will definitely recommend my friends to come.  We went to Hy’s Steak house last year and we were not happy with the food. The steak had no taste and we also spent a lot of money there.  We will not be returning to Hy’s. ,5
 接客が良かったです。 ,5
 料理も雰囲気も最高でした。 ,5
 My 45 day aged steak was terrific! ,5
 Food not really tasty. Seats and booths cheap and hard. Disappointing. ,3
" Seats were uncomfortable, need cushions.  Restaurant was a little noisy.  Food was excellent. ",4
 Service was very unfriendly. Refused to explain Groupon relationship. Food was very ordinary. ,3
 Always excellent home cooked Italian food. Delicious olive crusted  branzino. Remember to light the candles on the tables for evening atmosphere. ,4
" The waiter waiter appeared to be inconvenienced when we asked him for side plates so we could eat our bread and knives so we could eat our meals.   We shared most of our food - traditional Italian meals, but when the dishes were brought he just “dumped” them in front of one of us and said “you can figure it out”. The table was small and so we were juggling between ourselves to sort out our meals.   This is experience stands out in my mind as of the the most outstandingly bad experience at a restaurant.   The food was very tasty.  We also noticed another waiter (non Caucasian) in the dinning room who seemed very attentive and very cordial with his customers.  I do not know the name of our waiter but he would be the caucasian waiter on staff on Saturday. ",2
" Very disappointing experience. We used a Buytopia coupon, which had typos on the menu and one appetizer option was not served as offered (according to the server, it was a mistake on the menu). Inflated value of the voucher as the meal was not worth the price they indicated. ",3
" We just celebrated our 29th wedding anniversary at this restaurant, the same restaurant we had our wedding luncheon . Rossini's has been the place where we have spent many special occasions , including birthdays , graduations and retirements!!!  Our family tradition , for sure ! ",5
" My husband and I went there for the first time. We both loved the whole dining experience!! Our server was very pleasant and knowledgeable, food was very flavourful and ambiance was good. We will definitely go again. ",5
 Food would have been preferred if it not frozen. One dish out of four was frozen. All three desserts frozen. Nothing homemade.   Everything Rossini's fed me for dessert I feed my children so going out for dinner didn't seem like a treat at all.  If Rossini's can not stop feeding patrons frozen meals then its time to close shop.  It pretty daring to charge me top dollar for substandard food. ,4
 Dined here for Mother's Day lunch. This is a hidden gem. The service and food here was delicious. Our server was attentive and made our dining experience enjoyable. ,4
" First time visit, food was delicious, service very good ! The restaurant was almost empty, pity, much better than a lot of others in the area, you won't be disappointed ! ",4
 Ruebon was huge. Reasonable prices ,5
 We enjoy dining at the Pub. When you arrive you are greeted by the waiters who are very pleasant and outgoing.   Next the menu offers a great selection of good food and daily specials and drinks that are reasonably priced. I highly recommend The Pub to all. ,5
 We went at happy hour and had excellent appetizers for half price. Also had two kids who ate for free on Tuesday night.  We’d definitely go back. ,5
" Too loud!   The food was good, we have been there before.  This Friday at 6 they had a band, which would be fine if you had no desire to talk to your dinner companions.  Asked the manager to ask them to tone down, no go.... oh well, ",3
" waitress did not know specials or options on happy hour. we had a coupon and she at first did not know if we could use it (we did). we spent an additional 10.00 b/c she gave us wrong menu options. having said all this, both of us enjoyed our diners.  my friend's seafood diner was exceptional, too bad they are taking it off the menu. ",4
" The staff was very accomodating, and turned up the volume of the Bills game on TV. Also the beer from EBC was top shelf. ",4
" Awesome place to stop for a bite to eat while out and about or grocery shopping. You can't beat the convenience.  Simple menu of pub comfort foods, but it's consistently delicious and very affordable. Awesome happy hour deals and a great wine/beer list. The staff is always great and they even have live music! Just another reason Wegmans is the best grocery store in the US. ",5
" Waitress gave wonderful service. The lobster mania lobster was very little. Although special included side salad &amp; a few baby potatoes, We were still hungry. 😕 ",2
 Food bland and one appetizer inedible (calamari-tough tasteless and too much breading). 2 adults seated surrounded by tables with 2-4 loud crying children. Loud DJ playing trivia with Halloween music interrupting the ambience. Windows covered so claustrophobic feel trapped with loud DJ and loud children. Should be renamed the Kids Pub so no unmet expectations. Service EXCELLENT. ,3
 We met old friends for lunch and were very pleased with the atmosphere and menu items.  We found our server exceptional. ,5
 Food is just so-so.  Kind of pricey for the quality of food and I had a coupon. Extremely noisy- very difficult to have a conversation. ,3
 Not he greatest service. Was hard to get water refill. Steak was overpriced and an awful cut of meat. Lobby and was very loud and interfered with conversation and we were in the back of the restaurant. ,1
 Great food and drinks! The service was poor. ,3
" We went to  Pub for a wine and food  pairing meal.  The food  and wine were excellent. However,  instead of being a quiet  dinner  where we could listen to descriptions of the food and wine and discuss what we were eating and drinking,  the event took place  in an extremely noisy  bar area where conversation was  impossible. We practically  had  to yell  to talk to each  other across  a small table.  The rating system describes  the noise level  as energetic.  Not really, it  was obnoxiously loud. No matter how much we enjoyed the food and wine pairings, we  would not recommend Wegmans Pub as a place to eat. ",3
" The food is always fresh, the portion is adequate, and at a fair price. We eat at the Pub at least 4 times a month. Great service with very friendly and competent staff. I highly recommend it to everyone I speak with. ",5
 Great little casual spot in an unexpected setting... in a Supermarket!  We ate here for Lobster Week and there was a good variety of dishes at reasonable prices.  Very satisfied with the quality. ,5
" We've eaten the Wegmans Pub many times now. Last time we went we made a reservation on the recommendation that it was Lobster week and would be busier. Love Lobster week! The food was good but the service was awful (on the day we had the open table reservation). We enjoyed a kid's fish fry, lobster roll and a burger. The waiter, Michael I believe, messed up numerous things. Took 90 minutes to get through meal. Will be back but if we get seated in his section again we will ask for different section. ",3
" Very, very noisy and tables were on top of each other.  Food was good-but nothing special to cause me to return. ",1
" The bar service was non existant. I sat for over 10 minutes without acknowledgement. Not busy, maybe total of 6 people.  I moved to a table and received excellent service. The crab cake sandwich and salad was very good.  Will I return? Probably not. ",3
" Went in for the lobster week special. I could not wait to go because I truly enjoy lobster and had never had a lobster roll before.  I tried the warm roll, and while it was good, I definitely thought it could have been better. The lobster seemed a tad ""fishy"" almost. I have certainly enjoyed many lobster dinners where the lobster was much sweeter. It was OK, but I do wish it was better.  The appetizer of pretzel sticks and dips was delicious. And our waitress was very friendly and prompt.  Plus the decor is really lovely. ",3
" We came for lobster wk so ordered the 1 lb lobster dinner. It came with choice of salad: side or Caesar. I ordered the Caesar and Altho the greens were fresh and crunchy, the dressing was absolutely tasteless. The lobster was so tiny I could barely get 2 bites out of the tail. Claws were better but still only a few bites.  Server was obsequious. All in all I was disappointed. Would maybe try for a happy hour deal. But not soon. ",1
 Lobster Week was a treat. Total value for your $. Our server seemed overburdened as other servers were more attentive to their customers. ,4
 lobster week was well worth the visit. Mussels appetizer during happy hour is a very good deal. ,5
" Music was too high on arrival but was turned down later. Food was average compared to other local venues, but there are some really great local venues nearby. We were happy with the price for what we got. Nice having Guinness and Yeugling on tap, but would have liked Aviator Red or pick from the store choices. ",3
 Chicken quesadillas were bland and the much hyped chicken shawarma also lacked flavor. Wegmans needs to work on both. Food is usually consistently good! ,3
 Food was excellent and our server Jimmy was wonderful !! ,5
" The grilled seafood dinner was a winner! The food, outdoor atmosphere as well as the service was all wonderful. Hoping they will do this again before summer is over! ",5
" Mediterranean seafood dish was outstanding!  Caesar salad with scallops was a perfect size and a great value.  French dip was OK.  Beef was tough.  Overall our server was very friendly and knowledgable, but seemed a bit overextended the evening we were there.  I love Wegmans and their brand.  The Pub is a welcome addition! ",4
" You would never expect a grocery chain to have a great restaurant, nice food, great service, outdoor seating and craft beer.  Will be back soon. ",5
" We we there on a Friday evening.  Live music, really good food with adequate selections, and great service by Victoria, ",4
" This was our first time at The Pub and we weren’t sure what to expect with a restaurant attached to the grocery store. We made reservations on OpenTable. You walk in and they have a hostess stand and were promptly sat at our table. We showed up 10 minutes before happy hour was ending and our waitress was quick to tell us if we wanted to put in some food and beverage specials she could get them in before the cutoff. We had the hot pretzel and mac and cheese bar specials and both were delicious. I was there for the Thursday Lobster special (a whole lobster dinner for around $18!) but you can also get a cold lobster salad roll or warm chuck lobster roll (table next to us got it and it looked amazing). My husband got a steak dinner. Prices were very reasonable and our waitress was amazing. With a full bar and full menu, the Pub definitely exceeded our expectations. We will definitely return. ",4
 The food was great and the waitress was friendly and very helpful and attentive. ,5
 Live this place but recent menu changes will make me go much less often they removed my go to veggie wrap. ,5
" Been several times.   Used to be a pleasant surprise.   Now was just eh at best. No love in the plating, just slapped on.  Cold, hard fries.    Very limited wines and  really pricey.  Probably won't return ",4
 Thought we would try this on a whim...Was not disappointed !!  Great food &amp; service!! Great atmosphere !! ,5
" We were drawn here because it was advertised as a place to celebrate Cinco DeMayo.   There were some nice choices,  but when we received them, they turned out to be mediocre.  The guacamole was tasty overall, but had some very hard chunks that I assume were avocado, but had no taste to them.  Some of the chips were too greasy/soggy.  The chicken and mushroom quesadilla were so skimpily filled.  Those were definitely the weakest offering and too expensive for what we received.  The tacos were better - the best being the shrimp.  The musical duo in the hallway were good, but too loud.  Conversation was difficult.  Not impressed..... ",2
" THE OYSTERS ARE VERY GOOD, AND THE DRESSING IS OUTSTANDING. IT SEEMS TO HAVE AN EXCELLENT VINEGAR AND HERBS, PLUS A LITTLE CUCUMBER. IS THIS WHAT IS IN IT? ",4
" Wait staff delivered a half empty beer. When we asked about this they said it must have been from another table and got on wrong tray. This was after initially saying there was ""no problem"". So glad we saw this before we poured the beer. Overall service after this was terrible from wait staff. NOT a Wegmans hallmark ! ",3
 I wasn't sure what to expect but was pleasantly surprised by how good the food was. The atmosphere was nice as well. Definitely did not feel as if you were inside a grocery store.  I will definitely be going back. ,4
" went for lobsters.  always a good value, especially with their coupon.  hope the coupons wlll continue, good incentive especially with new customers. ",5
" The food was great, but the service really was just okay: my guest and I often felt forgotten about and that we were being ignored, despite a not overly busy restaurant. It was an overall ""just fine"" experience, but given the abundance of great restaurants in the city, a ""just fine"" experience doesn't really cut it. ",3
" Came for Winterlicous. The menu was a good selection of different dishes. My soup,chicken and flourless chocolate cake were all well prepared. Our service was good and everything came on time. ",4
 Ordered from the winterlicious menu and the value was excellent. The service was outstanding the courses came in a timely manner and every bite was delicious. My steak was cooked to perfection and the flourless chocolate cake out of this world. ,5
" Not worth it for the money you spend. No ambience if you go out with friends, just a few tables and you feel you are in the middle of a train station ",2
 Good place for team lunch ,5
 The lights were very bright and were reflecting off the window so caused a glare. Maybe if they were dimmed it would be better. ,4
" I have to say that when we first walked into the hotel we were disappointed that there was no festive decorations in the dining room or on the tables. However, this was forgiven when the food arrived. The traditional Christmas dinner was excellent and compliments to the Chef, kitchen staff and waitresses. ",4
" Pleasant lunch and food was tasty, but service was unusually slow, even allowing for the size of our group.  Meal was expensive and I didn't appreciate not being asked before additional bottled water was brought to the table. ",3
 I booked a reservation for 14 people. It was a work lunch just so we could all get together before the holidays were over. They gave us this very private section; which was amazing! It was closed off from the other guests; which was great since we could still talk about work. The food was amazing and although the service was a bit slow overall it was a great first experience. ,5
" Food excellent and well presented. However,  very pricey. ",4
" The food was excellent, presented creatively and the ambiance was fun and fresh.  They even had a live DJ in the lobby on a Thursday night.   Gave it that  ""happening place"" appeal.   If I had one suggestion to offer, it would expand the menu options. We all agreed there were not many Entrées to choose from.   Double the number.  Otherwise, GREAT. ",4
" Atmosphere was a hotel restaurant, not anything to seek out. Food and wine selections were ok, (not special), quality of ingredients decent, but the TV's and noise and overall lack of ambiance are not something I seek in a dining experience. ",3
" Very good food but the place is too quiet and frankly, dull: a run-of-the-mill hotel restaurant. ",3
 We have been to this restaurant several times so we expected to have a great experience. Unfortunately our service was terrible. The waiter was abrupt and didn't listen to our orders and when he came back with the incorrect order he acted like it was our fault. I live very close to this restaurant but I'm not sure if I'll be going back. ,2
 Great food and service ,5
" The location is great, really easy to find. Food taste is excellent with good service. ",4
 I went with my partner for Summerlicious and was very impressed with the menu. Delicious food. Make sure to allot enough time as the service was a little slow but very pleasant and professional. ,4
" We arrived at 11:30 for lunch and no one was there. A good or bad sign? Good for us since we were promptly seated at one of the two tables for 2 overlooking Bloor St. Not a bad sign since around noon they filled up with what seemed a business crowd. We ordered from the Summerlicious menu: daily soup (Manhattan chowder) &amp; fire roasted vegetable appetizers, saffron risotto &amp; salmon entrees, macarons &amp; mango sorbet for dessert. First, the food was very good and the service excellent. Second, two small menu clarifications would have helped. The Manhattan chowder wasn’t a seafood chowder – at least none that my wife found - although she hadn’t asked for specifics and assumed it was a seafood chowder. If she had known she would have ordered the garlic shrimp. The “roasted vegetable” is a salad, very good and I would have ordered it anyway. I can’t say much about the entrees other than everything was perfect. Same for the dessert, except I could have eaten two more bowls of mango sorbet AND a second plate of macarons – but the quantities were more than reasonable. We paired the food with two glasses of a light but still a little spicy Shiraz ($13 each, 9 oz). The décor is a classy modern but not particularly romantic, although someone could make it that, in the evening, without the business lunch crowd. All-in-all, good value for $23. ",5
" Service was OK. Server was polite but always in a hurry.Food tasted excellent but place was noisy,hard to carry on conversation.Was sitting at the entrance of the kitchen,in front of a service station.There were constant activities directly in front of us,not relaxing for the whole meal.Funny thing was, at that time the place was not full. We could have sat at other spots.???? ",4
" Excellent friendly service and good food, great ambuence ",5
 This place is awesome! ,5
 Great food. Would've appreciated quicker service but can't complain. ,4
 Nice restaurant. The ambiance wasn't anything special but the service was impeccable. Our waiter was basically at our beck and call. Also the food was great. Try the sea bass! ,4
" Pre cooked meals available for tourist who do not wish or do not have time to explore outside of the hotel. Decent quality although pricey, ",2
 This restaurant is consistently good for both lunch and dinner.  Recently re-done and it looks very nice.   Relaxed atmosphere great for catching up! ,5
 I love this restaurant -- particularly for business meetings -- given its great food and service.  It's upscale without being ostentatious.   I've been coming for years and it never disappoints. ,5
" Chairs are uncomfortable.  Seat is far too deep such that leaning back is just about impossible. I am 5'8"", I can't imagine how someone shorter than me would feel. ",4
" Good place to chat, spacious, food was good and had items not always found on menus.  The bread and dip was excellent. ",3
 Went for breakfast. A fancy place to go but nice for a change. There's always Burger King in the mall below. ,5
" Afternoon tea w/good friend , a quiet time as it was close to Xmas.  Staff was very nice, no rush, no pressure.  Polite, prompt, kind.  Food was good for price, great refillable coffee.  Will be back! ",4
 Ate breakfast here and loved the food.  Service was excellent and food was delicious.  We were staying at the hotel for the weekend and wished we would have eaten here before our last day. ,5
" The food was excellent.  We were their as part of the Summerlicious event.  Service was pleasant when the person was able to provide the service.  Because we were their on Saturday at 2:30, there was one person, hosting, serving multiple tables, and handling the bar.  I would say poor management.  the food was excellent. ",4
" What a great find. Walk pass this place everyday and wasn't interested in trying it. Figured it was just another overpriced hotel restaurant. Decided to go here for summerlicious with a couple friends as it's right by work and was very pleasantly surprised. Had the pork belly to start, the coconut milk curry chickpea casserole as a main, and the creme brulee for dessert. Everything was absolutely delicious and the portions were perfect. Not as big as fast food but definitely the ridiculously tiny portions of a lot of ""high end"" restaurants. The food was flavourful but not overpowering. Perfect for a group of foodies and non-foodies alike to enjoy. ",5
 Absolutely. Disgusting. I got sick. I will never go back. ,1
" Excellent food and top notch service with beautiful ambiance, it was just perfect choice for us. ",5
 It was a business lunch. A colleague came early and wanted to order early but the waiter did not understand. This created a situation where everyone came to the table and was forced to order right away which was awkward.  Food was good but portions are small given the cost. ,3
 Very good food and good atmosphere but very expensive for the amount of food. ,2
" The only issue was the bottle of Shiraz wine came ice cold, not room temperature, ",4
" We cancelled this reservation, the restaurant is under construction. The hotel bar, registration desk, and restaurant are all in the same conference room - poor ambience. ",1
 Server explained the specialsin which my guest chose then received something completely different. Order omellet go salmon. Didn't say anything as on lunch break no time to wait and it was still I nice meal but not what I ordered ,4
" We had Ben as our waiter, he didn't know what kind of ceasars there was. When receiving our food mashed potatoes were cold.Ben never came to the table upon receiving the food to ask how everything was, had to flag him down. Drinks were never topped up, had to flag him down for a takeout container then seemed confused when he gave it to us, questioned himself on whether he should take our plates, again had to flag him down for our cheque. Took a very long time for him throughout the meal. He should probably be retrained or simply find another job. Never looked like he wanted to be there at all. ",2
" Our server was great, and we got our food in decent time based on how busy they were. Keep up the good job guys! ",4
" Mentioned in our Reservation it was a birthday celebration...no reference while we were there. $178.00 bill for 3 kids/2 adults and hubby went to the bar to get his own coffee(orderd)...charged $3 for it still.... 2 steaks ordered were cold, 1 not done per ordered...think waiter didn't hear it right..should confirm orders. Maybe should put sides on a plate instead of plastic ? Ceaser salad in  a plastic takeout? Not going there anytime soon. ",3
 My fiancé wanted ribs for his birthday and awesome ribs he got at Montanas. Excellent food and service! ,5
 I pre booked a table for 8 with a highchair. We had to wait beyond our reservation time for the table to be ready. We had to ask several times for a highchair and menus. Some of our ordered drinks were served while two others were requested more than once. 4 of 5 ordered apps were served but had to ask twice for the other one. Almost 90 minutes before our main course came out.... and it was warm at best. For some reason we had 3 servers. The restaurant was less than half full. An empty table next to us remained uncleared for over 30 minutes. We asked for the manager and eventually had to seek her out. She apologized for the poor experience and offered to reorder for us. We declined and asked for the Birthday cake we brought with us so we could leave. The servers lit the candle and was going to serve it. We stopped that and left. A complaint to the general manager is next. Unfortunately my daughter's birthday dinner ended up with take out pizza after my grand children were put to bed. I was surprised and disappointed at the very poor service. ,1
" Fantastic meal as usual from this location. Server was not as attentive as usual, but food was perfect.  Would definitely recommend. ",4
" Great get over her for friends! Beer is always cold!   Menu is good, but needs more 'finger foods' or samplers with at least 2 of each taste test. Patio is always awesome! ",5
" Food excellent as always!  Great food, great service and great time! ",5
 We love going to Loca Luna. The drinks are great and they don't short you on alcohol. The food is delicious and a great price. We always enjoy dancing to salsa and watching the live band perform. ,5
" My two friends and I have been going to Amaretto Bistro now for about 2 years for our birthdays.  I think the cocktails, appetizers and dinners are excellent.  It's a quiet spot to enjoy a cocktail and dinner with good friends. ",5
 While the ambiance wasnt great the food more than made up for it.  Grilled octopus was tender and well seasoned.  Scallop dish was creative and perfectly cooked.  Service was appropriately attentive.   Definately a great finf ,3
" Food,and service was excellent.  One of the guests was very loud and talking to all the other tables.  Quite annoying and no attempt to quiet him down.  Other than that, highly recommended. ",3
" Been here several times, and always enjoyed it .      Last trip was very disappointing .      Server seemed disinterested,  was walking away from our table midsentence .      Never checked on our food, and there was a problem with one dish.       Doubtful will go back after most recent experience . ",2
 Phenomenal meal again at Amaretto Bistro! Already planning our next dinner outing! Love that EVERYTHING is made in house and supports local! This restaurant is a must! ,5
" Our first visit. It was very pleasant, with good food and excellent service. ",5
" Limited options but all four of us enjoyed our entrees and appetizers.  The service was wonderful, very friendly and attentive. ",4
 Restaurant week specials were wonderful and the service as always A one! ,5
" Must have been an off night.  Normally we get excellent service and I do recommend this place, however,  this particular Saturday evening was not their usual service.  Perhaps they were short on servers and they  did run out of two features.  Server was nice but was not aware of specials, no bartender was on hand and it did take a long time to get a table.   I will not give up on this restaurant, as I do love their food.  I am just hoping  it was an off night ",2
" As always, amazing food! This is one of our favorite restaurants! Everyone we bring becomes a fan! Great job Rich and Dave! ",5
 It was great food and great drinks! ,5
 Very cold restaurant and a bit rustic. But nice staff and fun music! ,4
 Loca Luna has never disappointed.  I brought a friend from out of town and she wants me to bring her again when comes back to visit!  Great food!  Great drinks!  Great ambiance! ,5
 The food was fantastic! Our server was so nice and accommodating. The food was so good. I will definitely return and bring my friends . ,5
 Had dinner for a Christmas present to a play at the Fox. Didn't have time to be tied up. Staff was curtious and quick. Food was excellent. ,5
 Horrible food!!! The chef and the cook have NO idea what a spanish paella is like or taste like or how to even cook it. Embarrassing. ,1
" Great ambiance, it was perfect for my friends birthday dinner with all of our friends.  They were very helpful to our group as we had to relocate because there was a baby with us, and the music was a little too much for him.   I can't wait to go back ",5
" The food was great and the prices are good. The portions are small (tapas). The restaurant was freezing. A couple left due to  how cold it was. The waiter/service was poor, he did come back to check on us (large party). We had to practically chase him down. The ambiance is nice with good music. ",2
" While could be a fun place to get together, there is often a three-piece group playing that is pretty loud, which makes conversation difficult. ",3
 The taste and variety of tapas selections are amazing. ,5
" Ceviche was not the same as the one I’ve had previous times. It lacked the same taste and authenticity.   The paella was delicious and so were the chips and queso dip. The mojitos were awesome.   Food arrived quickly and server was friendly, courteous, and welcoming.  Live band is good but too much Salsa eventually gets old and requires a little mix in the music. We need some bachata and merengue mixed in. The music was not on when we arrived and we playing it was on and off. Not fluid. ",4
 Area was freezing cold. Food was not cooked to order (undercooked) chicken was spicy with out notice. Food arrived cold. Cocktail drink was not tasteful. Music was ok need more Spanish variety. Hours for dancing is late. The server was kind. Space was friendly probably nicer in warmer weather. ,2
 Food was decent (ribs were dry) but service could definitely improve.  It was worth going on a Sunday for the 1/2 price Paella and bottles of wine. ,4
 Very disappointing.  I used to eat at this restaurant years ago at its Peachtree Street location and loved it. We decided to try the new location and it looked fun but the food was awful. The octopus was tough as rubber. The steak was tough. The shrimp were mealy. Nothing was good and I'll never go back. ,1
" We decided to host my 15 yo's birthday party here. They had an absolute blast. My husband, son, and I ate elsewhere to let them be teens. They finished before we finished our meal. I was a bit stressed that they were just waiting there, but when I arrived, the 8 girls where taking a salsa lesson. What a fun memory for all! And low stress for me! ",5
" I can’t speak on the value on any other day, but the all you can eat tapas on Tuesday is well worth the money.  Great Central and South American cuisine. ",5
" Food was amazing like always and it came quick.  Service on the other hand was terrible. The bartender (a woman) was terribly rude and for no reason at all, just because we wanted a different guy to serve us. Our waitress was slow, didn’t know the menu and wasn’t too friendly . Totally takes away from the experience. ",2
 Good tapas and food!  Good specials!  Great service!   Bad live band! ,4
" Food is good but overly priced. Even for tapas. The most intriguing item 9n the menu is the paella but it requires 45’ wait!  Who wants to wait 45’ for a dish while snacking on overpriced appetizers (tapas).  An even bigger issue is the incredibly high noise level. The music was so loud that it was impossible to talk during the meal, or even hear the waitstaff when ordering. This makes for a lousy experience. ",2
 We’re long guests to Loca Luna but something seemed different this time around. The food didn’t have the same quality as before. It’s almost as if the flavor was cut back. The service was excellent and there was a great ambience but the food has changed and we weren’t fully satisfied in that area. ,3
 Great food!  Even better drinks.  Knowledgeable waitress with good advice for must tries!  Great place to bring a group of friends or just the two of you.  Will be a recurring customer and recommend to others! ,5
" Great food, Jamie was excellent. It was Halloween 🦇 🎃 ",5
" Never disappointed, love food, drinks and live entertainment!! ",5
 food did not sit well with me. service was just passable. ,2
 Great date night place! ,5
" I really enjoyed Loca Luna. The food was very good although I  was disappointed in the sangria - tasted like juice with little alcohol. My partner had a margarita which he enjoyed  We had the mussels, nachos, spinach and grilled octapus all of which were very good. Even my friend who does not like mussels or octapus liked them.  The venue  has a nice design and layout - felt very spacious although it was quite busy on Friday night. Out waiter was excellent - very friendly and responsive. It was a good value for the money and I would definitely return. They had a singer and small band there on Friday night and the music was good without being overwhelming. My partner and I could talk without having to shout . Overall an nice experience and it appears to be a popular Friday night hang out. The parking was ample and FREE. The location is somewhat hidden although easy to get to in Midtown. ",5
 Good atmosphere and food.  Watching the salsa dancing was amazing. ,5
" We travel through Buffalo once a year and have made a dinner stop at this restaurant a must-do occasion. Fantastic food, lovely staff, and a thoroughly enjoyable experience! ",5
 The food was delicious and the service was excellent ,4
" Living in B-lo area all my life, I have never heard if this restaurant! It was only after my friends baby shower was there and said she knew the chef. Wow! Was the food amazing! ",5
" Every meal I have had here was spectacular. Last night, flat iron steak special cooked perfectly. Olive oil lemon cake with pear jam L, whipped cream and lavender was the perfect ending. ",5
" Hade a great salad, split, my French pork chop was, as usual outstanding.  How they can get a cop you can cut with a fork is a mystery.  Partner's filet slightly overcooked and tasteless - not a good $50 value - will avoid next visit. ",4
" We went with ""medium"" expectations and left with an awesome experience. The food was great, the service was great and you can tell that whoever runs this place is interested in his customers having a great experience. The look from the outside is very deceiving. This isn't the fanciest place but they impressed me and my family. I will definitely go back again and have been telling my friends about this hidden gem on Transit. ",5
 The service was very good and the food was excellent! We really enjoyed the halibut and lasagna. ,4
 Excellent food and atmosphere. Service is excellent too. ,5
" Not our first time and certainly not the last.  One of the best chefs in WNY.  Wonderful taste, variety, presentation and quality.  Keep it up guys and thank you for a superior meal. ",5
 Great food and great service. Comfortable and very welcoming. Will be back for sure!! ,5
 Staff was wonderful. Food was top notch. We really enjoyed our meal. we will return. ,5
 Excellent food and very competent wait staff.  Highly recommend! ,5
 we had dinner during buffalo restaurant week where they had special meals and prices. i have reviewed this establishment in the past but i feel they are just getting better .it was crowded because it was restaurant week but they really took care of us. ,5
 Great food and menu selection for restaurant week ,5
" quite an amazing dining experience... its all about the food... we've paid three times as much at various ""celebrity chef"" restaurants, and haven't had nearly the quality of food.  The quality of the ingredients, and the flavours of the end-product were evident in each bite.  This place deserves to be on the vegas strip, or in uptown Manhattan...  The people in williamsville/buffalo are completely oblivious to the high end cuisine that is right in their backyard! ",5
 Meal creativity as always was over the top.  I had Bison steak and octopus appatizee.  Just amazing!  Plated as a thing of beauty. ,5
" It is our third visit to this restaurant after two restaurant week dinners. It is one of my favorite Italian restaurant in town. We showed up earlier than appointment but we were able to secure our seats. Appetizer of the day (Octopus) and the entrees were great tasted. It was a Friday evening so a little too busy and loud, service took a bid longer but acceptable. Will go again. ",5
" Food was well prepared and quite tasty. Our server was pleasant and helpful but the service was very, very, very slow. Lastly, the atmosphere  terrible. The building is rundown and dingy.  I wouldn't recommend for that reason. ",3
" Amaretto is a nice, simple, quaint little spot with very good food.  The service and attention was perfect ... not too much/not too little ... A good ""should try"" ... Nice spot!!  I will go again! ",4
" Amaretto's is definitely my favorite restaurant in the area. I've been there for multiple occasions, with family, on a date, and with friends. It's consistently delicious food in an intimate, relaxed, and classy setting. Also, if you're a fan of duck like I am, their duck confit is excellent :) ",5
" Small, intimate restaurant. Great food. Would like more comfortable chairs and a bit more room. ",4
 Everything was excellent although a bit pricey compared to similar places with equal food quality. ,5
 Great place. Food was spectacular and the waitress was prefect. ,5
" It's ok,but small and old ",3
 I took my boyfriend to Amaretto for his Birthday. He wanted Italian and I wanted an upscale atmosphere (which it was). He had lasagne which was great! I had Pork bolognese. My meal was fair. I wanted something with a red sauce. The waitress recommended it highly. It was so salty I asked for red sauce on the side. I might go back again but I would definitely order something else. ,4
" Amaretto never disappoints, although from the outside, you'd never guess the pleasant interior and fabulous food that lies within. ",5
 The crispy calamari appetizer was delicious and a large portion.  The entrees were delicious and the chocolate dessert was a gem.  Nice selection of wines. ,4
" The service ,drinks and food was very good. The staff was very accommodating and friendly. ",4
" I chose a great place to start off my 40th birthday celebration weekend! Everything for most of my party was excellent. Ronnie, our server, was awesome! The only thing is that 1 of my guest became ill from the grouper tacos. He got sick immediately and it continued when he got home. We know it was the grouper tacos because he is the only one that ate both of them. My other friend that ordered it took 1 bite and knew something was not right. His exact words were ""They smell too fishy"". Otherwise, everything else from the salmon, calamari, shrimp &amp; grits, nachos/salsa/queso/guacamole to the beef brisket were excellent!! There were 9 in my party. ",5
" I hadn't been to Loca Luna in a while and decided to have my birthday dinner here. The server was friendly and accommodating. The food was quick for the most part. A few dishes were a little slower coming out. Everyone was able to find something they liked. Great band, good drinks good food and a great celebration!! ",5
 All you can eat tapas is a great concept. Thanks! ,4
" The food,  drinks and service was awesome. Sparkle truly outdid herself. She jumped in on our date game which made fayre night that much better! ",5
 The food was awesome and so were the drinks.  Great spot to hang out and relax ,5
 Food was very good not a place to go if you're looking for a quiet romantic dinner. Definitely a place to go for some good salsa dancing party!! Loved it ,5
" We really enjoyed our meal at Loca Luna! Everything that we tried was very tasty. Tapas are my favorite, and these did not disappoint! One kind of negative is that we have the Atlanta Pass Book which has discounts for meals at participating restaurants. Loca Luna is in the book, and the page says ""buy one entree, get one free."" But, there are no entrees on the menu. So really, instead of being a 15-20 value (typical entree cost) it was 5-7 dollars (price of the tapa we got for free.) No big deal though! Still enjoyed very much and will return!! ",5
 The live band was amazing. The service and food were out of this world. Drinks were very good.  Noise level is high but expected with a live band and music. The dancing was fun....only thing I didn't like is that there is no coat/purse check if you need it because you don't want to hold your purse while dancing or if it's not a cross body. ,5
 First time there and didn't have a bad plate.  Definitely going on the favorite list while in ATL. ,5
 Great food! Great atmosphere!! Fun place all the way!! ,5
 Great place for tapas and drinks ! Me encanta ,5
 I went to Loca Luna's to celebrate my birthday with friends. The environment was very lively and entertaining. The food and drinks were really good and I really enjoyed myself. ,5
" The food here is always great, but today it was superb! Absolutely delicious from the appetizer to the dessert! ...and great cocktails at the bar! ",5
 First time being at this restaurant.  Very low key but the food was great.  Service was phenomenal.  Would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for great food and great staff. ,5
" Food was very good!  I had the osso bucco which I highly recommend!!  The caesar salad was very small, which we were surprised about.  The service could have been a bit better but overall we really liked it.  Great atmosphere.  Like that they have round tables for 4. ",4
" Great service, professional, prompt and good food. Dining experience was great. ",4
" I would have rated it higher if it wasn't for the cold air constantly coming into the restaurant from the front door.  I would recommend putting a second door in to stop the wind from whipping in.  Food was great and the restaurant is very unique.  Love the decor.  Unfortunately, it is a loud place.  I think it may be because of all the wood and brick that doesn't allow the noise to be dampened. ",4
" The preparation of all the food choices were excellent! Our server Tom, was most helpful and great personality. The soup was outstanding. We can't wait to return. this was a great experience!! ",5
" Had a great time here for lunch.  It gets pretty crowded and loud, so book in advance! ",4
 Party of 11 everyone was pleased with their meal and service. Great wine recommendation . ,4
" Great food, service and ambiance! We would definitely return. ",5
 A truly hidden gem!   Exceptionally good Italian food with vegetarian options available.  Friendly and helpful staff. Can’t wait to go back! ,5
 Loved the wine ,4
" My lobster ravioli was very tasty 😋 but it could be a tad bit less salty.  But overall would recommend this dish.  Clam chowder was really good and would highly recommend if you love chowder soup.  Calamari as an appetizer was perfectly grilled, very tender.  Mussels were great as well.  To close off the meal, tiramisu was heaveny!!! ",5
" Everyone in our dining party loved Caffino! We had great service, great food and the ambiance was just right for celebrating our special occasion. ",5
 This restaurant was very authentic! The pasta was delicious!! ,4
 The food was delicious and the atmosphere was really great. We were seated almost an hour after our scheduled reservation. We were brought a piece of bruschetta each to make up for the wait. Although I thought it was good it wasn't necessarily worth an hour long wait especially when 3/5 guests were pregnant. ,4
 Excellent but a little loud.  Probably due to holiday guests. ,5
" we enjoyed our meal and the ambiance at this restaurant , we were a party of three and all of us ordered decaffeinated cappuccino after our meal, i stated how it was so good and unsure that it was decaffeinated.... I'm now sure it wasn't because all three of us were awake for most of the night.... i find this disturbing and i promised myself i will never order any type of coffee after a dinner meal anywhere at all anymore ",5
" I have dine at Caffino's several times, as well as, taking clients for lunch. This time we were disappointed with our server, especially since it was an hour drive into Toronto.  He wasn't particularly interested in us. It won't stop us from going back. ",3
" First time very impressed by the experience will be coming back , thx for the friendly and pleasant experience ",5
 Had a great lunch with clients today. Great food and service. Will return. ,5
 Food was exceptional as usual. This is a great restaurant for food and ambiance. ,5
" Great place for a business lunch, food was excellent, service great! Restaurant needs better ventilation, too smoky in the dinning room and my clothes smelled after lunch. ",4
" Have wanted to try Caffino for many years and selected my husband's 50th Birthday to give it a try. I never expect a restaurant to do anything special because I indicate a celebration as the reason we are dining with them but this was very disappointing. Not even an acknowledgement or ""thank you"" for selecting their restaurant for this milestone. My husband found a worm in his salad and the plate was removed without expression of regret. ",2
" Came here for a long over due date night with my boy friend. I had booked this reservation ages ago in hopes for a nice evening with my significant other... This jewel of a place has a beautiful rustic, warm and authentic feeling to it. However, when we arrived we were promptly greeted but we weren't asked if we had a reservation, and just plopped down, which was a bit disappointing because it took away that I had been on their dining list for the past month (also, what if it was a special occasion and I requested a special seat or service). When we were seated the usual water and drink order came. Then we ordered the calamari for $18.00 and asked for a side of bread while we pondered our entree orders. Our calamari came and we were completely underwhelmed by the bits of squid on a bed of lettuce and so much so that we were hesitant on ordering more food. So, we tested one more dish and it was the luigia pizza. The pizza was lacklustre and bland... I did see some dishes go by that looked hearty and well prepared, but if you can't get pizza right or even a simple calamari dish, I'm not going to experiment any further. Please keep in mind throughout our dining experience our server did not come to check on us once, did not ask us how our meal was during or after.  Nor did he notify us of the specials on  the menu or asked if we had any questions. Finally $65 later for two beers, one calamari and one pizza we paid by credit card and the server ripped out the bill and walked off. That was that.  I honestly have never felt like a restaurant has given me the one finger salute until now. If you like Italian food and want that low key rustic feel and not spend and arm N a leg. Go to Gio Rana's on Queen East. Dear Caffino, get better management ... really really disappointed  Date of dining : sept 8, 2017 at 7:00pm ",1
" Great food, poor service! My experience from booking the reservation to paying the bill was extremely disappointing. Not worth it!! ",3
 Caffino is a neighbourhood gem that is tucked away. Every once in a while we rediscover it and have never been disappointed. The food is excellent and the restaurant has great ambiance. We will be back. ,4
 THIS LOCATION IS CLOSED. WE BOOKED A RESERVATION AND DROVE 25 MINS JUST TO FIND OUT THAT IT WAS NOT OPEN. -_- ,1
 Excellent as usual.  However service was a little slow.   But overall great.  Will be back. ,4
 Been here before and never disappoints.   Only complaint is food was served too fast.  Felt a little rushed. ,4
" An excellent spot for a business lunch. The staff was attentive but not disruptive, the food was absolutely fantastic and the ambience and noise level was perfect for a semi-formal lunch meeting. Very pleased. ",5
 Girl get together ,4
" Always thought this was such a gem. However was deeply disappointed upon my visit last night ..... We made a reservation for 9:15pm, showed up at 9:15pm and were promptly told that the kitchen was closed!!! What organization accepts a reservation when they aren't even able to serve a customer? Definitely was not pleased to have my time wasted! ",1
" We were six people and had six different meals. Each of us mentioned that the food was extremely salty. Service was alright until the end. When we asked if we could get separate bills, the response was unfriendly and not very professional. ",2
 Very accommodating for our seating of a large group! ,5
" We saw an ad on television advertising a slab of ribs and 2 sides for $12.99.  They looked really good on television and the price was right, so we decided to make a reservation and try them.  The ribs were very good and we picked slaw and salad for our two sides.  Everything was good and the server was very good, attentive, helpful, and friendly.  It was as advertised and we would try them again.  The menu said the ribs were normally 20.99.  We split the dinner and they were very happy to do that, but as a senior citizen, we just can't eat a full order anymore.  There was a limited choice of wines by the glass, but the one the waiter recommended, was good. ",5
 We went to this restaurant to celebrate my son's birthday and watch the OU football game.  We were extremely disappointed to find that although we were seated in the bar and only OU fans were there the restaurant would not turn off the music and turn on the sound of the game.  I would not recommend this restaurant if you want to watch sports.  My son's birthday celebration went well (other than not being able to hear the game).  The staff sang happy birthday to him and took good care of us. ,4
 Everything was delicious.  Best digby scallop dish I have ever had.   D ,5
 Excellent food and service! Presentation was very artistic and wonderful to look at (and eat)! ,5
 This was my first time here but won’t be my last. The restaurant was lovely with a beautiful snowy scene out the ambundant windows. Terrific food and very friendly staff. They provided a beautiful piece of pumpkin cheeseCake for my friend’s birthday as well. Amazing to know that the kitchen is staffed with students from Niagara College’s culinary program. Well done!!! ,5
" Food and facilities were excellent, and the availability and range of onsite craft beers and local wines made the experience all the more enjoyable.  The hot beet salad was amazing, as were the scallops (Mary Jane) and cod (Dave). The bread appetizer was great, but perhaps could have been paired with some dipping oils/sauces. All in all, well worth the hour's drive. We'll be back. :) ",4
" This was our first visit to Benchmark.  The restaurant has a very comfortable and inviting ambience.   The service we received was very friendly and attentive.  Most importantly, the food was delicious.  All four of us were more than pleased.  Value for the money is excellent.   We will definitely be back again and again.   I’d consider this a real find. ",5
" Wonderful experience as usual! My husband loved the burger he ordered, and even said it was the best he'd ever had (which is a huge compliment coming from him). The margarita pizza was also excellent. Great atmosphere, and even better food! :) ",5
" I was in Niagara for a weekend trip with some friends. We spent the afternoon going around to wineries and we needed a place to eat dinner. As no one was familiar with the area, we went onto Opentable to search and came across Benchmark.  Wow ! What an amazing place. The restaurant is on college campus and it is run, to my understanding, by students in various programs at the college. The restaurant even serves the college's own beer and wines and features wines from wineries or vineyards that their alumni are a part of. The food uses local ingredients.  I will definitely come back again. ",5
" Wonderful to support the culinary students in Niagara. The food was great as was the Niagara College Wine and Bear. The  server was knowledgeable , and smiling.  Everyone should add this spot to their restaurant list for any  medium to high end dining at a reasonable price with good atmosphere. Good for larger crowds and  couple dining. You may not be greeted when you walk-in but just go to the bar for prompt service. ",1
" Friendly staff, great atmosphere, and fun concept. It’s great that the restaurant supports the college and gives people the chance to experience what students at the college are learning! We had a great host and really enjoyed our meal. Try the beer and wine tasting flights! ",5
 Great experience and amazing value.  Would come back for sure. ,5
" Waitress was hands on, very friendly and food was delicious. Perfect portions. 2nd time there and 2 nd time loved it.  Will definitely be back. Very accessible and being in a wheelchair, found no problems...bathroom included. A great place to go. ",5
" We enjoyed the food very much and were happy to be told it was local however my sweet potatoe fries were not very hot when they were served to me so consequently became quite cool as the dinner went on.  The bread with the honey butter was delicious but possibly could be a free item.  The other meals were wonderful- scallops; Alfredo.  The coffee was superb.  The restaurant was decorated for Christmas and looked fabulous.  We lunched at a time when the restaurant was filled with high school students which was a little distracting &amp; noisy but they were very well behaved and we were able to have conversations with no problem. Our service was good with good attention to detail.  We didn’t have any cocktails at lunchtime but when I come back will definitely try your wine.  I would recommend the restaurant because of the wonderful menu choices and the use of local fare.  It has easy access from the highway as we were coming from Burlington and the free parking was a bonus.  All and all, a great experience. ",5
 Overall our experience was very good. France our waitress was excellent and very courteous. Both my wife and I are Niagara College alumni so we were very proud to see how the college has grown over the years. We are foodies and we were very happy to be able to spend some time at The Benchmark Restaurant while away from our home in London. We will come back for sure! ,4
" We've been many times before, but this time the entire experience was great. The salad was tasty, the Digby scallops were  excellent (can I please have the recipe) and the dessert was scrumptious . It was a really good experience and a very good way to impress an out  of town guest who was taking me out . Thank you! ",5
" I took my wife for dinner to celebrate her birthday. Neither of us had been at Benchmark for dinner previously and we had heard good things. The setting is great and the room very attractive with a lot wood and glass, and high peaked ceiling. We unfortunately had to wait for several minutes to be seated as there was no one to greet us when we arrived. The hostess let us know our server's name and that she would be with us shortly. However, we ended up waiting almost 15 minutes for our server, by which time I had actually forgotten which entree I wanted. After that, the service was generally good. Our dishes were beautifully presented and very tasty. My wife had 'Roasted Beet Salad' and 'Butter Poached Fogo Island Cod', while I had ""Puree of Parsnip Soup' and 'Ontario Lamb Cavatelli Bolognese'. Our only complaint about the food was that the entrees did not arrive hot enough; presumably too much time was spent on presentation with the food not under the heat lamps.  All in all, it was enjoyable, but not memorable. ",3
" The only reason I gave the BenchMark a ""fair"" rating is because it is a teaching restaurant. The waitress recommended an appetizer which was terrible and a bottle of wine which was not suited to drink with a meal. But the worst part was seeing both the supervisor and a waiter wipe their nose with the back of their hand in the restaurant for all to see. We stopped eating after this event as we did not want to get sick.  OK, i know the restaurant is a teaching restaurant for new chefs, but really???  The food was nothing special and the serving staff were terrible.  And as we saw, the staff were being supervised/coached by an teacher who was any better.  We have eaten at BenchMark before ... never again. ",2
" We have been to benchmark on several occasions and always enjoyed our experience.  However, on this occasion,  we found that the servers were very unexperienced and spoke to each other in their own language at our table, the service was very inadequiate in comparrisib to previous visits. Everything was exceptional other then the service. ",4
 Nice location with beautiful view of the gardens! Dinner was great! Close to area shopping and amenities. Would definitely go back! ,4
 We had a lovely time. The vegan option was excellent. ,5
 Absolutely an awesome experience. From the moment you walk in to the time you leave. You feel well taken care of and satisfied. Definitely will be coming back. ,5
" Attend with several co-workers for a nce meal.  The food and ambiance was high quality.  The service was superb, with a high attention to detail.  A reasonably priced menu for a locally-sourced Restaurant.  Happy to support student learning, both culinary arts and hospitality.  Worth a visit...unquie experience. ",5
" There were four at our table. Three ordered a pasta dish the other a scallops dish.  The scallop dish was amazing, but all three past dishes were small portions (given he price point) and the sauce was tasteless ..in a word underwhelming. We get this is a college and students are in training ...so with this in mind, don't charge prices like it is an upscale restaurant. The young servers were pleasant and attentive. Overall one in four. ",3
 This place was such a pleasant surprise. Food was excellent and service was pleasant. A hidden gem. ,5
 We had a wonderful experience!  Loved everything. I especially enjoyed how the meals were labeled with dietary restrictions. We will be back for Sure!  Thank you so very much! ,4
" The meals are always outstanding, the servicer knowledgeable and friendly and the atmosphere welcoming. My daughter has a peanut allergy and they take great care to ensure a safe meal. ",5
" This is a great place for a beautiful lunch.  I've never been for dinner but every lunch I've had has been delicious, timely and well served.  Always enjoy this restaurant. And they have meal restrition options like Gluten Fee and Vegetarian.  Also very accomodating to my time restriction.  Thank you. ",4
 The food was amazing. However if your going to be a five star restaurant you should  have a five star look and five star service. The service was good it just wasn't great. Worth going for the food though. Next time I won't wear a tie. ,4
 Our second visit to Benchmark was delightful. The food and service were excellent. The restaurant is certainly showcasing its talented students.  The restaurant can be rather noisy at peak times. ,5
 4 friends back together after more than a year. All had excellent meals and shared a bottle of their Pinot Noir (excellent) ,5
" Great food, great value. We have been 2 times and will be returning again. ",5
 This restaurant was a pleasant surprise    I was from out of town and it was recommended from the hotel.   Great recommendation. ,5
 We had an amazing meal. Service was exceptional. ,5
" We had high expectations for this restaurant. The raspberry sorbet was a delightful way to finish the meal, but the main dishes seemed one dimensional in flavor. The ancient harvest salad might have been healthy, but it was aching for spice or zest. The small plate of Sicilian cavatelli also lacked depth in its flavor.  The apple fritters were enjoyed by the 13 year old who ate them.   Everyone thought the local honey butter on the fresh bread was wonderful.  The beer was a beautiful amber color and quite tasty. Overall , the staff was friendly and helpful.  The steak dish that went to another diner looked perfectly seared. ",4
" We enjoyed a delicious lunch at Benchmark -- such a beautiful restaurant with big windows, great views and a menu that is always interesting and always superb!  A very welcoming and comfortable atmosphere with top notch service!  Bravo to Niagara College, staff and culinary students! ",5
 Extremely busy that afternoon. The service was excellent but the delivery of food and drinks took over 45 minutes. Not that we were in a hurry. We assumed not enough servers and/of chefs??? ,4
 First time there and will definitely return.  The menu was quite varied and it will change seasonally so that is something to look forward to.  Pricing was very fair for our party of 6.    The wine selection was great!  Dessert was fantastic.  We all shared several appetizers and each had different entrees and shared as well.  A really fantastic evening with GREAT service. ,4
" Service was  great,  as was the food. We were served in a timely fashion as we were going on to the theatre. We will return, thank you for your hospitality. ",5
" Friendly and welcoming staff! Beautiful restaurant, love the large windows that allow you to enjoy the floral scenery outside. Service was good. My dad ordered a salad with his burger and got fries, our server apologized nicely and brought him out a salad no question. The Fried Tempura Korean BBQ Tofu was incredible, coming from a vegetarian and often struggles to find vegetarian food at restaurants, definitely coming back for this. My family had the burger, chicken sandwich and Soppressata pizza they also said was very good. ",5
 I previously visited for dinner and this time for lunch.   Both times were excellent.  Will be back! ,5
 Nice restaurant. Pricing higher than expected ,5
" We were very dissatisfied with our experience at Williams Landing on the weekend.  While our server greeted us and got our order in a timely manner, we cannot say that the same service was carried throughout the rest of our brunch.  Our food took quite a while to come out and was not as expected.  For example, two of us ordered two forms of eggs benedict and our poached eggs were all hardboiled and quite cool.   All of our orders came with potato hash, but upon receiving our meals we all received friend potatoes.  My fiance and our friend's eggs both were ordered over easy but came out over-hard.  Our server checked on us within a brief time of receiving our meal, but then not again until we had been finished for a very long time.  Overall, this was an extremely dissatisfying experience and we will not be coming to Williams Landing again for brunch. ",1
" The live band was amazing! We went on a Thursday and we had amazing service although I with the online menu was up to date I had my heart set on those short ribs. I settled for the fried chicken instead which was still amazing. Great time, great vibes, and good laughs. Had so much fun I forgot my servers name but he was amazing as well. The peach cobbler... was so good I was dancing in my seat. Will definitely be back! ",4
" Server didn’t listen to requests for milk vs cream, siracha vs ketchup.  Also could have been more attentive toward end of meal - to see if we wanted anything more. ",4
" My salmon dish was way overcooked as was several other dishes at my table. I did not pay for the meal and wouldn’t recommended going there for the food. Drinks and a patio, sure. ",2
 Requested a special dessert for a new years eve dinner and they made a delicious mousse - it was so good! Williams Landing is the place I recommend to everyone when I have a meeting or friends over. The menu is diverse enough that there's something for everyone. It's the only restaurant where I'm constantly trying out different dishes bc they're all so good! ,5
 Wonderful! ,4
" Nice place and the food was really good but took a while for it to come out which makes it tough when it's a group from work going out for lunch. That said, I would go back. ",3
 basically a second home - we are here ahead of every TFC Game.  The food is almost always spot on and service good.  The only issue is that every TFC game they are in way over their head - the last 2 playoff games they ran out of beer glasses an hour before the game so you had to keep yours and hope for the best on whether it was getting refilled- you would have thought they would have adjusted for the finals.  The bar itself is huge - they just need to properly staff for games. ,4
" Great service, and a cool restaurant to enjoy a drink and some food. ",4
" My boyfriend and I had been wanting to try  this place for a few months months. We decided spur of the moment Friday to make a reservation and go. Unfortunately we probably won't be back. There was a party going on in one half of the restaurant and the people at it were exptremely loud and drunk. We were not the only guests in the restaurant who were bothered by this - I saw multiple people move their table to across the restaurant or leave entirely. No one was doing anything to see if we were okay or apologize for the noise, our server was the party's server and therefore neglected us pretty bad. Asked for the bill mid-meal because we just wanted to get out of there and the waitress forgot and it took 20 minutes to get her attention to get the bill. Too bad they prioritize big loud parties over regular customers. I understand it was Friday night and people want to let loose, but this was just excessive. ",2
" My daughter and I went to Williams Landing for Dinner on a friday evening. It was very noisy, the service was mediocre and the mussels were undercooked.  I wouldn't go out of my way to visit again. ",2
" If i wanted to go to a Club, I'd go to a Club. The music was blasting the entire time that we were there. It was a Sunday afternoon. Numerous patrons asked numerous staff to lower the volume. The staff all agreed that the volume was way to loud but even they couldnt get the volume lowered. We won't be back! ",1
 Overall was fine. Would return. Only problem was Cesaer salad came without any dressing and pizza came with onions when ordered without. Wasn't that busy at the time so would have expected order to be correct. ,4
 The hostess at the door was really rude and seemed bothered by people coming in. ,3
" Food was cold, and although it is pretty darn good it's less appetizing when poached eggs are chilly. The server was lovely, but the service quite slow. I've been a few times and that always seems to be the case. Their Caesars, however, are worth the trip. ",2
" We went to have lunch before a CFL game and spent a beautiful afternoon light on patio.  The lady who served our table was very attentive, and we had a wonderful time. ",5
 The service was amazing during brunch. I will be going there again ,5
 Nice place with good food. Service is very good. They have a beautiful patio for great weather days. ,4
" Nice place, the 2nd Landing I have visited. The door to the patio was open &amp; our high table was a little close to a cool draft blowing in. The open door also invited a bird &amp; there were annoying fruit flies buzzing around. Music was a little too loud to enjoy having a conversation. The food was good, only hiccup was with one order that had no sweet potato fries as requested.  There was 5 in our party, with 2 separate bills. Both bills were wrong. I was overcharged $20+ for 3 beers we didn’t order. Our server was apologetic &amp; quickly made the correction. Apart from that the service was really good &amp; my glass was always full ",4
 Food was great and the service was good. Came for a late lunch with my family and had a good experience. The Caesar was the best part! ,4
 Service was terrible. Our waitress was very slow and then non-existent. We later found out she had to leave and someone had taken over our table. We weren't informed and thought she was just helping out. ,3
 This is my second time coming here and each time I had  an excellent time... The food and the band there Thursday night was truly amazing 😉. ,5
" Interesting drink menu and I enjoyed some of the monshine drinks.  Food was okay--not great.  Pulled pork was dry but the shrimp and grits was tasty and a large serving.   Our server was attentive.  Music was enjoyable.  Would have stayed longer, but had another place to go to. ",4
 Great time only thing is table for 2 is very small and tight you dont have room for drinks and food almost knocked over 😂 ,5
 Went here for Southern food as we were attending a conference.  Great choice ....  Food was great and the service was excellent.  Also had a band there that was also very good.  Would recommend again. ,5
" If you are looking at the name of this place and thinking ""That looks like a good place to try"" then you should definitely  go!  The music is great.  The food is better.  When we went the band started at 7:00pm, go get an earlier reservation if you want to talk some.  But after that, be ready for good soul/R&amp;B music and authentic southern specialties.  Great night.  Can't wait to go back! ",5
" Went to brunch with family. Service was amazing and we had no wait for seating at the bar. This was my 2nd time and the food wasn’t quite as good as it was the first time (a little cold, not lacking in flavor), but still a great experience! ",5
 We had a great timr ,5
" Had a wonderful time! Would definitely recommend, especially for special occasions. ",4
 It was my aunt’s 60th bday. I have another aunt  who has a bday a couple days prior. They are from a time where their mother owned a light club that sold food and had juice entertainment so i wanted them to experience that once again. Our experience was awesome and we laughed the entire time! ,3
" This was my 3rd time dining at Sweet Georgia's Juke Joint, like they ALWAYS do...They delivered.  It was my Grandmother' 85th birthday and there was NO other place I would have taken her.  I hope to take her for her 86th birthday.  My family loved the food and the trio that played that evening was ON POINT.  What a GREAT night!!! ",5
" My first-time visit was a good experience. There's live music which has $5 fee per guest, plus additional costs in parking with an average of $20 for the entree and drink. The chicken and waffles seemed to be ordered the most, in which I also ordered. It seems to be a nice hangout spot for the entire family during lunch, but I'm sure it's gets really ""grown and sexy"" at night. Be sure to make your reservation with open table to ensure it won't be too long of a wait! ",4
" This was a first visit for the 5 of us. Over all the brunch food was tasty but not over the top, with some items overcooked (eggs in the crab Benedict and omelets). The parmesan grits were a hit and so were the deviled eggs appetizer.  We did want to both enjoy the music and visit with one another but found it hard to talk at all when the singer's performance was underway (loud). If there were a way to tone the vocalist's volume just a bit it would be more enjoyable over all (we were sitting at the seats furtherest from the stage). The music was fun and enjoyable. When the singer took breaks and the musicians played, some of the time it was very pleasant and not so loud as to be overwhelming. ",4
 Great server!!! ,5
" Great atmosphere, loved the live music  Service great, food pretty good. I'd  like to come back for the Sunday brunch ",5
 Here for the trade show. Great music and service after a long day. ,5
 The restaurant is conveniently located and easily visible from Peachtree St. The hostess was a little cold and short when we first entered the restaurant but improved as we talked to her more. This can also be said for our waitress who turned out to be awesome. I felt that we had to joke with them and convince them that it was okay to be nice and provide good customer service. The food was well seasoned and you received large portions which were both positives. ,4
 The second band (The Trio) was quite a hit!! ,5
 We sat at the bar on a Sunday for brunch and football. The service was excellent. The bartenders were very attentive to our needs.  The food was fine. I had shrimp with grits and my husband had an omelet.The endless mimosas were great. We just wish we knew in Georgia you  can not serve alcohol before noon. ,4
" It was fun, entertaining, the food was delicious, the service was amazing. All around great experience. ",5
 This was my 4th visit since last year and the service was just ok. The food wasn't as good as I remembered either. I was disappointed. ,3
 The live music was excellent! I enjoyed everything about the place!⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ ,5
 It was great! Good service! Great food! And good endless mimosas! ,5
" Sweet Georgia's Juke Joint was a blast. The entertainment was excellent, and certainly worth the cover charge.    the Bloody Mary was excellent, and the fried chicken was delicious. One of my friends said she typically never eats the skin of the chicken, but this was a rare exception!  We went for Sunday brunch. The customers were there for a good time, and a good time was had by all.   I  found the staff to be very nice, not necessarily experienced. But their willingness to serve superseded their experience. My recommendation to tourists or first time visitors is to remember this is a Juke Joint not a 5 Star restaurant. Once  you remember that, all is well! We found the price to be very reasonable. ",4
 Bad all the way around ,1
" This place offers authentic reasonably priced southern cooking accompanied by danceable blues music with an easy-going vibe. The music limits conversation but the band takes breaks, and the place has personality. ",4
" We all enjoyed our food, and our server, Eddie, was very accommodating and attentive. The music was on point for festive ambiance. ",5
 Great fun night with real Atlanta southern cooking  Love the band ,5
" friendly service, good food, great music and good value ",4
" Every time I come to Atlanta I make it a point to visit. Great food, awesome live music. You can’t miss! ",5
" Great atmosphere, waitress was very  polite . The food and drinks was awesome, I really enjoyed the entertainment. ",5
 I loved every bit of the experience and atmosphere ,5
 The live music was the perfect complement to the good food. ,4
 The waiter forgot our appetizers which made our wait longer for food. The greens were not hot and the mac and cheese was very dry. Our reservation was for 7:15 however the food should be served hot. ,3
 Food did not impress. It was very average. Dj but no dance floor. ,3
 Excellent service and great dinner. Very comfortable and trendy ,5
" Great food, service and atmosphere! My family was in from Waterloo and they all loved it! ",5
 Music was up waaaay too loud.  We all left with headaches....and it was a teenager party.... ,3
 I really wish I could remember our servers name because he was amazing. It was a crazy busy night for the Mayweather vs. Mcgregor fight and he was running around all night and making sure everybody was taken care of. Food was pretty good and the prices were great. ,5
 The staff were great.  Some in our party had food restrictions and they were able to accommodate every request.  The Manager even came out to double check the allergies and to make sure they got things right. Food was delicious and a great selection of drinks. ,5
" Hostess not very friendly on arrival for our reservation.  You will wait a very long time for food and drinks. Having said that, the servers are friendly,  the setting is light and airy,  the patio is great and the food is decent as were the prices. ",3
 The lamb burger was delicious! Good atmosphere and service. ,5
 Hunters Landing has much better food/menu options! Thought this would be similar - disappointing. ,3
" Food, service, and drinks are consistently great.  My favourite place to go before a TFC game, but make sure you book a table well in advance! ",5
 Great place to gather with friends. Food was terrific! ,5
 Cutlery was extremely dirty. Service was a bit slow. Fruit flies buzzed around us. The cleanliness was very poor. Not worth going back for another meal (which was jus ok). ,3
 A very enjoyable dinner. A table on the patio was a great place to enjoy the good weather. Our server was attentive and friendly. Everyone in our party of six enjoyed a delicious meal and all at a more than reasonable price. It was our first visit to William's Landing but not our last. ,5
 Food was a bit cold and portions were small but the patio is nice. Service is slow. ,2
 I love going here to hang with friends for drinks but the food is awful. Very bland no flavour.  Sesame Tuna Salad - awful. Pizza - you call that a pizza. Spaghetti carbonara- you should be embarrassed saying it's a top choice. The kitchen staff just show up for the pay check they don't care about making quality food ,2
" The Nachos were my favourite.Tuna was good too.  Don't recommend the turkey burger. Great atmosphere, but very loud. They ran out of cheesecake so we didn't stay for desert. ",4
 Tasty food. Horrible non existent service. Ignored for an hour. ,4
 Brisket roll a must try. Good pizza and nice friendly atmosphere.  The service was very slow. Overall it  is a nice place for casual dining ,4
 Rebecca was so friendly and helpful with our dinner choices. Thanks! ,5
" I love the location, how open it is, food was great but problem was how long it took for a drink order and how long it took for a drink to arrive! Monday at 6pm with a half full bar. Pleasant service mind you but 10 mins for the table to be approached is too much. ",4
" Much nicer than Hunters Landing, the server was great,we were seated close to the patio and had a good breeze. The sticky toffee pudding is a must have ",5
 Good food and great atmosphere. Overall wonderful time with the family ,5
" Great food, great service, great atmosphere.  A friend came in town and stayed at the Ritz.  I didn't realize it was across the street when I made the reservation.  Highly recommend!!! ",5
 They charge an “Entertainment fee” of $5 per person. Food was decent but service was absolutely horrible. ,2
" Fun atmosphere with live music and southern classics like fried green tomatoes and shrimp and grits.  While we were there a spontaneous conga line broke out and pretty much everyone in the restaurant joined in! There were lots of groups celebrating birthdays too.  It is noisy but fun.  The food was good, although it was heavy fare.  The waitstaff was friendly, service was pretty slow.  We went for a fun night out with entertainment and good food and we enjoyed ourselves. ",4
" I really enjoyed my experience at the restaurant. The live entertainment was awesome and the food was great.  The chicken was not crispy like I like, but it had great flavor and it was moist.  The peach cobbler was the best and I ordered two servings of Mac &amp; cheese.  I will definitely be returning To enjoy the live music.   My server was patient with me and overall a great server. ",5
" 53 by the Sea exceeded by expectations. My husband &amp; I celebrated our anniversary here for an early lunch due to very busy schedules (the 1000 point bonus was a big plus too) &amp; enjoyed the experience.   For appetizer, we selected the ahi kataifi roll which was delicious. My selection: seared scallops  &amp; mixed berry affogato...both very good &amp; portion size of the dessert was huge.  My husband selected the 3 course meal, which was more than reasonably priced at $38 &amp; included a Chef's trio for appetizer, he opted for the catch of the day, &amp; coconut panna cotta. I can't remember specifically what was included in the appetizer except for shrimp, a carpaccio of some kind, and a watercress wrapped thin beef.  He said the shrimp was ok but the carpaccio &amp; beef both really good. The fish was a white meat deep sea fish &amp; came as a very generous portion. He also liked the panna cotta, which was light &amp; served with fresh fruit.  The restaurant also served a complimentary strawberry shortcake for our anniversary, which was a very nice gesture.  Service was spot on from beginning to end &amp; every one was attentive &amp; courteous.  We would definitely dine there again, perhaps for dinner in the the future. ",4
" View, food and service impressed my clients. Their ""new favorite restaurant "". ",5
" Town was great!  Food &amp; wine both delicious and service was friendly, knowledgeable, &amp; prompt.  A delightful evening  all around. ",5
 Impeccable service with awesome ocean and Diamond Head views! ,5
 3 course lunch was great - the fish option was delicious and light. ,5
 Took my daughter here for her 16th birthday just father and daughter dinner...I had an excellent experience my waiter was awesome...I needed a strong drink...I got one...lol...for dinner we started off with the chilled seafood showcase...nice presentation...then ordered the tomahawk steak...slight miss communication and only had one on order...but I wasn't disappointed...had dessert....and a complimentary dessert for the birthday girl....I was hesitant to go...because of friends with bad experience here....but all in all...our experience was awesome...we coming agian... ,4
" In Hawaii for our 41st wedding anniversary and thought we had found a lovely, romantic restaurant.  The hostess knew it was our anniversary and I guess she thought sitting next to one another on a bench was romantic. She put us at a table where we both faced the window rather than one another. My view was actually a pillar. I would much rather have looked at my lovely wife. The worst thing was that there were large families with little kids on each side of us. Between babies crying and 5 yr olds playing games on their cell phones, any romance bit the dust early.   Forget the dress code. I had a dress shirt, tie and sport coat but the two fathers next to us had t-shirts on.   The food was good and well prepared. The service attentive though oblivious to our conditions.  Not a restaurant I’ll return to and I suggest you look elsewhere unless you enjoy the ambience of IHOP. ",2
" Great ambience and wonderful service but food was just ok. Ordered both  $100 &amp; $150 tasting menu. If you're an avid seafood/steak upscale diner than it might not be up to par, with what you're normally used to. Other than that, ok overall. ",3
 Amazing night! Food was awesome! I loved the choices for scotch and all that. ,5
 Ordered the surf and surf...shrimps were tough....everyone else's food was excellent. ,4
" Fantastic waiter, Joshua. Entire staff was very attentive. ",5
 Great as always ,5
" Went for my boyfriend's birthday - staff very friendly and all wished him a happy birthday, came with a complementary cake as well! ",5
 Engagement ,5
" We came in and celebrated my Retirement. I did the Chef Degustation+ Wine Pairing , and Lehua the Tasting Menu. Matt was our Server We really enjoyed all Dishes and plan to come back and explore the Ala Carte Menu ",5
" Great menu, outstanding staff. a very special moment in time. ",5
" Simply lovely One of the best meals I have had in Honolulu. A lot of foodie places are fancy sounding but disappoint in execution. Our food was perfectly seasoned, not overwhelmed with salt or sugar. Each ingredient carefully balanced. The wait staff were well trained. Solicitous without being obsequious. Kudos to Glenn in particular for making my 86 yr old mother feel like a queen on her birthday. The complimentary slice of birthday cake, with greetings written in chocolate sauce on the plate brought a huge smile to her face. ",5
" We were impressed with all aspects of the restaurant from parking, location and the view, service and food. We ordered a 12 oz. steak and it’s just perfect. The surf and surf was extremely satisfying so delicious. All of the food that we ordered was amazing and we never expected the complimentary Anniversary dessert which is actually perfect. Great experience. ",5
" Exceptional place for date night, special occassions (ie anniversary) and host weddings.  Our experience was wonderful, great service and food. Highly recommend family and friends ",5
 It was our first time at this restaurant and I was delighted with the service and the food. Thank you for making my birthday celebration amazing! ,5
" Lovely setting, delicious food. Wonderful, attentive staff! ",5
 This place was totally amazing. The wife loved it!!! ,5
" The duck was dry and the fat was not rendered, mushrooms had too much garlic, finally they have a good selection of wines but very overpriced nearly double of retail ",3
" Food was good.  Waiter was a little stand off-ish at first but was okay.  Even though it was for my friend's birthday, they did NOTHING to help me acknowledge it which was very disappointing. ",4
" Sophia the waitress was the best part of the meal, really tremendous. Leek soup a bit expensive at $9, but was very good, the killer was the eggplant bread which cost $13 and came with only one piece of bread.  The pasta was good, but over priced at $23 for what we received.  Cut place, but not much value in the offerings, but as stated above. Sophia was a great waitress. ",2
" Outstanding food, best meal on our trip, would highly recommend!!! ",5
 Food was well presented and tasty. Eggplant bruschetta had a great topping but the bread was very hard to bite or cut into. Goat cheese pancakes with lilikoi was delicous but portions were small. Gnocchi was excellent ,4
" Went for first time to try their pasta, but pasta maker broken.  Had Penne pasta instead with same sauce: okay.    Waitress was nice, but hadn’t brought bread until much later and only because we had to ask. ",3
" Great food, cocktails, service (Olivia) and atmosphere. Thoroughly enjoyed our night, thx! ",4
 Food expectations were not met Service was awful..waiter got order wrong and 6 of us were served food one by one. Maitre D didn'teven acknowledge us and ignored us as we were leaving. So not the good foos Honolulu experience we were told of. ,2
 The service was very slow. Quite delicious food but we waited 45 minutes and they weren't very busy at 6:15. ,4
 A private chef recommended Town to us and we're glad she did.   We sat outside and savored every bite.  Highly recommended. ,5
 This is a neighborhood restaurant which has excellent food served by very friendly and helpful staff. They are very accommodating with food allergies and provide a great dining experience. ,5
" It was my first time and I will definitely go back again.  The food was fresh, creative, and original.  The portions looked small, but it was just right.  They had a tasting menu that I would love to try on my next visit to Town.  My friends and I had a great experience! ",5
" Had dinner here in March 2017 and loved the food so much that I booked a reservation from Canada before we left.The food was as exceptional as the last visit-the best meal we had in Honolulu. The only comment I have to make is that it is extremely noisy and hard to hear anyone at the table unless they are sitting right next to you.Definitely not the place for a quiet,romantic evening. But I will be back! ",4
" Our service was terrible - server had a real attitude.  We waited 2 hours for our meal and were ready to leave and our meal was finally served.  Talked to Manager and she complimented our meal, which was very nice, but we would not go back. ",1
" We were welcomed enthusiastically, seated promptly and were quickly off to a beautiful evening.  Our group tried the vegetarian plate, the pasta and the roasted chicken. Each meal received a rave review.  Our delight continued with the chocolate pretzel pie and the panna cotta desserts. A reasonable wine list and cocktail menu was available. The restaurant was full but the noise level still allowed pleasant conversation. My thanks to Cat for tying it all together for a perfect experience. ",5
" Town was the beginning. What I mean is that 6 years ago my wife and I move from NYC to Oahu, Hawaii. The only thing that was missing from our total package was the food scene. There was basically none. We were Wine Educators for over 30 years in NYC so food and wine were very important to us. Then we found Town. We felt that we were back in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. The other night we had their hand cut pasta with pork and beef. Really an amazing bolognaise. As close to my wife’s as possible. The ultimate compliment. And to top it off you have multiple choices from their super wine list. A great staff adds to the Total Package. ",5
 We found the food to be delightful and tasted wonderful. My daughter had the Ulu and leek soup which was amazing.  The eggplant bruschetta gave a whole new twist on using shisto peppers. The Ahi tartare was just the way you would wish it to be. The entrees were also delicious. My husband got the fish of the day which was Mahi Mahi. He did not share much but the taste I got was perfect. I got the pork loin and the flavors were sublime with the portions right on. My daughter got the pasta and it was a lovely take on comfort food. Our server was pleasant and very knowledgeable.  We did not want for anything.   We were pleasantly surprised when the manager recognised us from eating at one of their other restaurant and came over to say hi. It made us feel like regulars even though this was our first trip to Hawaii.  If you are a foodie - this place is for you ,5
" Absolutely love dining  here. Food, staff, decor, open air all appeal  to me. ",5
" Food was good, but steak was tough and staff didn't offer a well needed steak knife.  When server delivered food, she had dangling bracelet which dragged through food as she served across the table. ",4
 Very disappointing ,3
 ワイキキからバスで行きました。 13番乗車 乗り継ぎ9番と不安でしたが ドライバーが親切 バス停も教えてくださり 気軽に行けると思います。 メニューの案内を詳しく教えてもらえますし 対応も爽やかでした。 ,5
" Salad was negligible. Flavor profile was poor. Could make better salad at home. Pasta was okay. Hand cut noodles were okay, but again flavor was just passing. ",2
" The madness if Waikiki had us both needing something else. This was the perfect antidote and then some. We decided to dine at the bar where we had wonderful service from Sonny - standouts were the pork and the light hand rolled pasta. Thank you, we will be back. ",5
" Went to lunch with my friend.  Clean, polite, a very relaxed atmosphere.  Menu is small, but all sounded yummy.  My friend got the pasta.  I sneaked a bite.  The pasta was cooked perfectly and the meat sauce so delicious.  I ordered the salad with chicken breast.  The chicken was so moist.  We ordered fries on the side...thin, crispy, and we couldn't get enough of the dipping sauce.  Town is such a great place to dine.  I love that they use local food whenever possible.  I could survive dining at Town and Ed Kenney's  Kaimuki Superette and Mud Hen Water diagonally across the street from this gem.  Local food at its freshest and best. ",5
 You can never go wrong at Town. This is truly one of the best locations in the city for dinner. Amazingly fresh ingredients and creative dishes. Service is always exceptional. ,5
 Soup was cold.  Burger and fries mediocre.  Extra Parmesan for other entree was sticky and seemed to come from someone else's table? ,2
" No question the worst restaurant we’ve been to on the island. Not only did our waitress take ages to even acknowledge our presence, only half of our table got their food after waiting over an hour and the rest of us didn’t get our food until after the first half was already finished eating. Only a table of 5 people...half of us ordered steaks. Not a tall order for an restaurant worth their salt. ",1
 Perfect lunch. Very fresh ingredients. Simple preparation allowed unique flavors of each dish to shine. ,5
" Exceptional Mahi fish for Lunch!  The flavors blended so well, cooked perfectly! (sorry I don't recall but it was served on bed of barley or something.....it was outstanding, I ate it too quickly to recall)  Service was great, friendly &amp; attentive. S true neighborhood gem, thank you Town! ",5
" What a fun evening!  Great service -- we like to share dishes, and without asking, everything we ordered was divided into two servings -- delicious food, and well-made cocktails.  We particularly liked the ahi tartare appetizer and the fresh catch entree.  And the coffee at the end of the meal was fantastic! ",4
 I love this place! But I was a bit disappointed in the quality and taste of what I ordered this past time. ,4
" Was surprised that such an innovative reputable supposed great chef couldn’t come up with a meal that didn’t have raw onion or garlic . We were suggested to order a bowl of polenta ... really , what a huge disappointment . ",3
" I've been eating at TOWN since it opened for business.  Since then, the flavors and creativity of the food has gone down.  I love pasta.  I always order the hand cut pasta.  The pasta with the pork and porcini argue has gone down considerably.  It's ground pork, very ordinary.  Pork belly is the  buzz ingredient right now.... possibly they should consider incorporating pork belly into this dish.  And at $18.00, the value is poor. My barometer is ""when I can cook better, then it's not worth eating there."" ",2
 Exceptional experience! Food is incredible andamazing value. Will be back! ,5
 Wedding anniversary ,4
 Staff is very attentive and friendly. Will definitely come back for more special occasions! ,5
" Great food, service, and everyone was very friendly. Our server was great! ",5
 Wonderful experience and great service. ,5
" I had a good birthday experience there. .. Only one thing I didn’t appreciate is when I went into the restroom and the host ran behind me saying that I can’t use this restroom because it is not part of their restaurant, I felt that for the money that we spent there  I should be able to use any restroom. ",5
" I visited the restaurant to celebrate my girlfriends birthday in Honolulu. I left the restaurant a note about the birthday event during my reservation. A complimentary cake was given at the end of the dinner and the staff are very friendly and attentive. Overall I highly recommend this restaurant as a visitor, atmosphere, service, food and value are all very good! We enjoyed it alot. Thanks. ",5
" so pristine and beautiful, food was amazing I have never dined out like i have here. ",5
" One of the Top 5 restaurants in Honolulu. View: spectacular, service: excellent, food: delicious and beautifully presented. Is one of our favorites for lunch or dinner. ",5
 すごく良い時間を過ごさせていただきました。 また、来年新年のお祝いに家族で伺うことができたら良い一年が過ごせた事なのでその際は楽しませてください。 Opusone2013非常に美味しく頂きました。私には手が届かないですが、ワインリストもしっかりしていました。また、ハワイどこに行ってもそこそこな場所が多い中、日本で料理を食べているような心地よさを感じました。  ごちそうさまでした。 ,5
 Hirota manager of the manager and you all very well Dinner on 1st January 2018 was able to spend very nice time. I also want to make a reservation next time I visit Honolulu. Thank you！！ ,5
" I booked this restaurant at the request of one of my girl friends not knowing what to expect.  We were just getting together for dinner.  Upon arriving to the restaurant I was pleasantly surprised because the outside looks more like an elaborate mansion not a restaurant.   Keeping in mind I thought we were just going to a casual restaurant to eat, catch up on life etc.  My friend and I were greeted by a friendly valet.   As we got out of the car and walked up the stairs, someone greeted us at the large doors.  Upon entering I was amazed at the decor which was beautifully done.   We were seated by the hostess right away.  The view of the waterfront and the ambience of this restaurant was superb.    We ordered a tomato and avocado salad, Mac nut crusted Mahi, Lobster pasta and the Berry Affogato for dessert.  My friend and I actually shared family style.  I know it was a bit unorthodox for this type of restaurant but we just wanted to taste a few of the delights on the menu.   The portions were just right.  Everything was delicious, the staff very attentive and friendly.  There was a gentleman playing music and singing off to the side of us.   We both enjoyed our experience at this restaurant and highly recommend for special occasions or to impress a date perhaps.    I already made reservations to take my husband for our anniversary.   I figure I will impress him with this place. ",4
" Very beautiful restaurant. The view of the city is gorgeous! Service is very good at the restaurant! Our main was absolutely delicious (surf and turf with the crab). The appetizers were good but nothing to write home about (pork belly, mushroom stuffed with escargot).  The drinks were also very good! Would definitely go back! ",4
" Outstanding food, view and professional yet friendly service. ",5
" Sunset is the perfect time to go. Very opulent, valet parking, great staff, food is very good. ",5
 53 by the sea was very  accommodating and helpful in my being able to propose to my now fiancé. The food was great. The menu selection was awesome. The service was superb. Thank you so much for making my special day even more special. ,5
 It was alright. ,4
 Would definitely come back for special occasion. We felt a little ignored by our waitress. We had to flag another down to take our order. ,5
 I received a fine-grained service. The food and the shop were very satisfied. ,4
" The wait staff were VERY accommodating with regard to allergies, other dietary needs and special requests. We were quite appreciative! ",5
 大味じゃなくて食べやすかった。 ,4
 Fresh farm to table meal ,5
" The food was excellent, very farm-to-table menu, however, the service was inattentive at best, the food took a long time to arrive, and the air conditioner was blasting straight down on us from a unit on the ceiling by the hostess stand -- avoid tables right near there if you can. Outside/patio seating may be a better bet. ",3
" My wife and I really enjoyed this place. The food was fantastic, and the service was great. We each had a main course, appetizers,  and dessert.  We both thought it was a bit loud, but it is right om the street  and very open to the outside. Would not prevent us from going back. ",5
" My favorite restaurant on Oahu, with maybe the exception of its sister restaurant Mud Hen Water across the street.  Great food and people, that I make a point of enjoying every time I go to Hawai‘i. ",5
 Food was disappointing. Fish  was soggy and appetizer was still frozen ,2
 VERY VERY LOUD IN OUR AREA THEY ALLOWED OUTSIDE PEOPLE TO COME IN TO THE PARTY THAT WAS NOT EVEN PART OF THE ORIGINAL GROUP LOTS OF YELLING HAPPY BIRTHDAY NOW COME ON HOW MANY TIMES TO YOU NEED TO SING EVERY TIME PEOPLE CAME TO VISIT THE GROUP THE HAS TO SING ,5
" We met for dinner here with a group of 4 couples, four of us have been friends for a long time, but don't get to see each other very often. We were looking forward to meeting up around the holidays to catch up and enjoy a nice night. We snagged a last minute reservation at 3 Brewers, but shortly after we were seated, a live music act began setting up just behind our table, making it nearly impossible to have a conversation. Just as our food arrived (terrible timing on our part), we asked if there would be any way to switch tables, just so we weren't directly next to the speakers. Since their other large tables were already reserved, the wait staff graciously offered us the private function room, where we could still hear the music performance, but we could also hear each other. Our server came by often enough to make sure we had what we needed and the food/drinks were delicious. The staff really went out of their way to make our night enjoyable and best of all, our bill was quite reasonable. ",4
" It was very good, great place and perfect service! I recommend ",5
" We went to the bar to watch the Canada/USA outdoor game and although there was only one other party at the restaurant at the time of the game and they were watching it, the bar would not put the sound of the game instead of the music which made our time less enjoyable. We also did not see our server for the last hour we were there. ",2
 Great spot for post-Marlies game eats on a Saturday. ,4
" Great service and the food was spot on. Pretty standard menu but they delivered on all of our orders.  I ordered the rack of ribs, and they were fall off the bone with a tasty BBQ sauce. Like I said, pretty standard fare but well done. ",5
 Always a great meal at a great price. And that beer! ,5
" Horrible experience!! Went for dinner with my daughter before a play downtown. I ordered the Reuben sandwich and upgraded fries to ""beer battered Maxi fries"" while my daughter had the goat cheese and roasted red pepper sandwich with regular fries. My Reuben had 2 thin slices of smoked meat and looked like those triangle sandwiches funeral homes put out after a service. The ""Maxi""  fries were not battered at all and looked like regular fries that were over cooked! My daughter's sandwich was cold and the peppers were soggy. We waited 10 minutes to get the malt vinegar and ketchup we asked for because the girl bartending was also one of the 2 servers in a fairly busy restaurant. She didn't stop by once after we got our food  to ask how things were and after waiting 20 more minutes after finishing our horrible food, we asked the only other server for our bill. That also took 20 minutes!! Time to hire new kitchen staff and more servers or no one will eat at 3 Brewers!! ",1
" Jackie our server was delightful, friendly and service oriented. ",4
" We were greatly disappointed with our experience this day. We were there for lunch prior to the Argonaut Playoff game which started at 1:00 pm. We arrived on time at 11:30 am and ordered our meals at approximately 12:00. At 12:50 we still had not received any food. We stayed as long as we could and then advised the waiter that we would be leaving.  To his credit, he did not allow us to pay for our drinks. This was our second time at this establishment. Our first visit was satisfactory but I for one will not hurry back. ",2
 the beer here gives the worst hangovers. My particular dish was awful and looked nothing like the picture. ,3
 Good food and good beer. Slow service because they were not staffed properly. Pleasant wit staff. ,4
 Great spot to check out the game or have a quick bite with friends. ,5
" Amazing place, had such a great time. Food was delicious, beer was superb, service was phenomenal. Thank you for everything!! ",5
 Service and food both very good. Great place to eat if going to Exhibition Park. Easy walk to park. ,4
 A very chilland friendly environment. The staff goes out of their way to help out in any way they can. ,5
" Food and ambiance was good, kitchen was a bit slow but we were a group of 6 so having fun. They brought us fries on the house to make up for it. ",3
" Food was good and came quickly , the waitress was excellent, very attentive. ",4
" Unfortunately my party of six did not have the best experience at our outing to 3 Brasseurs.  The venue was selected over others in Liberty Village based on its high rating and positive reviews.  This was a special occasion for us with my sister, brother in law and two of their friends who had traveled from North Bay to attend a concert featuring the Doobie Brothers and Chicago at the  nearby Budweiser Stage.  We reserved two hours prior to concert time however due to a lack of staff present (one staff tried to cover the entire second floor) service was very slow.  A nice setting for a visit however we were worried the delays would make us late for the concert (which it did) and when the food finally arrived we had to eat as quickly as possible, pay and run off.  Not the experience I had hoped for. ",2
" Food and drinks were quite good, but restaurant was horribly understaffed on a summer Wednesday evening. Despite having a reservation we were seated upstairs in what appeared to be a closed section and waited a lonnng time to be served ",3
" Food wasn't well prepared - either too cold or over cooked. Ordered poutine - cheese curds were cold and fries were lukewarm, kids burgers were overcooked and dry, kids ice cream dessert was completely melted and missing ingredients. The other dishes (tuna poke, sausages) we had were good. Service was pleasant but painfully slow. ",2
" Went here for dinner before a concert. The food was excellent with some unique dishes such as the chicken and waffle sandwich. The service we received was terrible. We had to flag someone down to get service after a lengthy wait to start. Parts of our order was missing, we were never given any condiments and no one came back to check on us. ",2
 The beer is amazing ! Food is also good. The vibe was a little confusing for the restaurant but I really did enjoy the service and food ,4
 Pre Toronto FC dinner. Excellent beer and food. Gets really busy so good idea to reserve. Will definitely visit again. ,5
 Came with family and friends for a quick bite. Food was ok. But wasn't looking for a gourmet meal so was pretty much what I expected. Staff were nice but took forever for someone to take our order or check in with us throughout the meal. Music was too loud. Front colleagues need more coaching and with that and better noise level the place will be much better! ,2
" Food was ok...got a chicken sandwich, and it just seemed like they slapped a slice of cheese on it at the last minute. ",4
" Great place to stop at for an evening out with friends. Atmosphere is great.. The food was decent. I had the chicken and waffles but the chicken was a little rubbery. Management took care of that pretty quickly though and the service was great. The ""flamm's"" (flatbreads) were really good.  I would definitely go back again to try some more food and enjoy some more beer. ",4
" The food was great and the service was friendly! There was a decent selection of great sounding foods to try, which made choosing a dish difficult--and obviously means I'll have to return. The advertised Brunch also looked delicious. ",4
" Went to watch some sports, have appetizers &amp; a few drinks. If you're only going with 2 people tables are situated in the best spots to get a tv view. Nachos were o.k barely any cheese. Drinks were good and service was alright. ",4
 Food is awesome with large portions to share.  It's affordable and authentic with great desserts to end a warm comforting meal. ,5
 Very good meal. Service was excellent and the food is great. The fettuccine supremo was excellent. We joined Buca’s eClub years ago and are frequently provided with special offers that feature new menu items and valuable coupons. ,5
 Stopped in for dinner.  Always know what to expect as this is a chain restaurant. ,4
 Great time with great service . Thank you! ,5
 Everything went great for an impromptu birthday dinner for a group of 20! Cam and our servers were accommodating and wonderful!! ,5
" Buca's is always a great place to go. I still haven't learned to not order too many dishes. Even the small size plates are huge! We were celebrating 2 birthdays and were pleasantly surprised with their massive brownie sundae. The staff was great! We had 4 generations there and the Manager (I think...) made us feel very special. My 90 year old, fabulous Mother was tickled. Mahalo Buca for making this day extra special for us. :) ",4
 Excellent! ,5
 Joe was great waiter. Baked ziti was delicious ,5
 It is always awesome eating here. My family and I always enjoy our time here. Food is always great. ,5
 Enjoyed ourselves ,5
 We came to celebrate my husband's birthday and told the hostess but the waiter didn't recognize the birthday at all. ,3
" It was the worse ever! We had a very disrespectful waitress named Paulina who did not offer us anything, ignored us the whole time and we have three kids! I have never been treated so poorly in my life and will never go back which is saying a lot because I live in the condo right across the street and until this past visit, had nothing but praise for the restaurant but now I won’t go back because of how the staff there treated myself and my family. I will go as far as I need to up this restaurant’s chain because no one should feel the way we felt dining there.  I even tipped $20 on a $80 bill cause I felt bad. I will tell everyone what a horrible experience I had there.  I even spoke to the manager and he acted like he didn’t even care, which made things worse.  There was nothing done by the staff there and even when I involved the manager, he just brushed it off and made me feel stupid.  I’m going to raise this to the corporate level because it was the worse experience ever! ",1
" This food is average at best. I had an awful stomach ache just after eating the chicken lemone . My husband sent back his fettuccine alfredo because it was cold and tasted sour. The gentleman who served us was a kind, understanding man and wanted us to be happy and was very accommodating. The best part was getting our photo taken by the woman who sells photos she takes table side. Nice lady. Happy to support. She isn’t affiliated with the restaurant. ",3
" Great service, very quick, and delicious. Huge portions! ",5
" Good food, festive atmosphere.  Love that you can order food family style and share several different dishes.  The female photographer was a gem!  She is very good at her job:  witty, friendly, and took great photos (however, we did not purchase any as they were overpriced @ $20 each).  I think you'd sell more pictures if you made them more affordable , especially since most of us have cameras on our phones. ",4
" Please don't leave the dining program.  We enjoy the restaurant, but the distance may not be worth it without the dining program. ",5
 Service was slow and  food was okay. Our area was empty yet they put another large party right next to us when there was space on the other side. ,3
 The menu was still boring. We came just because because my wife had a coupon. ,2
" The food was so-so.  I don't know why at lunchtime they automatically give you the dinner menu.  I had to ask for the lunch menu, although sandwiches are not served on weekends. ",3
 Food is good but prices are getting more expensive. ,4
 Waitress was very kind and courteous. food was ono ,4
" Everything was good as usual but the beginning was not pleasant. The  hostess I guess was having a bad night, and it showed in her service. Not even welcoming us and walking to the table said nothing. Usually  we are asked if we want to see the kitchen, celebrating something ,or where the bathrooms are but all I saw was her back. Our sever in the other had was great. ",5
 Food Is always exceptional here. The wait time went by pretty fast and the hosts and servers were very attentive. ,5
 portions are enormous but the quality is not grest. nice service in an amusing setting. a bit pricy. four cocktails a small chopped salad and a small pizza was over $100. ,5
" Always love their food but this time was the worst ever, the deep fried calamari and the spicy shrimp was awful, it’s was cold and oily and greasy. The table we were seated was so small and you know if you have  been there that their food portion are to be shared . So every time we have to use the table next to us put our used plates even our bread too. Was so disappointed the manager did took the appetizer off our bill but still very disappointed. ",3
" Although we had reservations we waited awhile to be seated since they were short on workers.  I think we waited about 10 minutes.  It could have been longer.  They were going to seat us in the bar area and so I requested a table with better view of the TV screen.  So we had to wait another 5 minutes.  I was amazed that the food was really good this time.  We were there about 2 years ago for a birthday and the food was just okay.  But this time I was impressed with my vegetarian pizza.  The kids enjoyed the meat sauce spaghetti.  The caesar salad would have been excellent but there were just too many croutons.  This the first time someone order the brussel sprouts and I must say it was very good.    Service was just okay, not very much people in the bar area. ",3
 This place is always great for parties and large family gatherings. But they were out of lasagna !! 😔😔😔 ,4
" Food was so good, and our Server was so awesome made us feel comfortable and made our dinner fun! ",5
" As you walk in the place is big.  But those 2 hostess one with glasses and one without.  The one with the glasses skinny chick very unprofessional, unfriendly and has no enthusiasm dealing with ""CUSTOMERS""!!!!  PLEASE SOMEBODY PLEASE REMIND THIS SNOTTY HOSTESS SHE IS WORKING WITH CUSTOMERS!  PUT ON AT LEAST A FAKE SMILE.  NO GREETING OR ANY SMILE.  She'll take you to your table and don't say anything and just walk away.  ""WHAT A TURN OFF""!  SHE NEEDS TO BE BEHIND THE SCENES AND WASH THOSE DISHES.😠😠😠👎👎👎👎👎 First contact is the most important to set your feelings and mood for that place.  And with this hostess I'm not planning on going to this place again.  She needs some ""SERIOUS TRAINING ON HOW TO PRESENT HERSELF.  IF SHES UNHAPPY LEAVE!   😂😂😂😂 Other than that the service was good.  Food was good.  Just a bit expensive. ",3
" Busy Friday night. Service was spotty, food lackluster. Also, the prices went up and the servings seem smaller. Bye bye Buca.. ",3
" Good experience. Waitress was very attentive to us. We ordered the penne in meat sauce with mild sausage, artichokes and portobello mushrooms. Just the perfect size for three ppl. ",5
 Good for family.  Nice and quiet ,4
" Large portions, amazing food ",5
 We just went in to use our coupon for a free colossal brownie sundae we received for our wedding anniversary. Server was so nice!!! ,5
 As always... good food with enough leftovers to take home. ,4
" The atmosphere and food was great. Being our first visit we were not expecting family style dishes, so it was a bit difficult choosing which ones to order. Left with a fully stomach and left overs too! ",4
" Good food, good service.  Don't just show up on a weekend expecting to get a table quickly.  Make reservations. ",4
 Fun quick and great service ,5
 They ran out of the house red wine which was disappointing as the substitute was substandard ,5
 Way too loud...TVs. Otherwise great food and service ,4
 Our server is on fire! Super attentive in a non intrusive way! ,5
 Good food and service.  Only downside was there were too many people standing at the bar and the top of the stairs and where we were seated people kept bumping into us or the table.  Other than that great place to meet before or after a game. ,4
" The beer was very, very good.  Much better then the first time I tried their in-house brews 8 years ago (when they first came to Toronto).  They have come along way since then and I commend them for that.  :)  The staff were very friendly and our waitress even commented that we looked like were friends catching up so she tried her best to not intrude too much when checking up on us.  The food was good, there was lot of room; as in they did not pack the tables too close together so you could barely move.  The decor and ambiance were also very relaxed but inviting.  I look forward to checking them out when the whether is nicer to see what kind of patio they offer. ",5
 We ordered the chicken entre and the portions were small. The pull pork was very salty ,3
 3 Brewers is good restaurant. Value for money is there and the space they are in is really nice. The food is solid and the beers offered are great. ,4
 The food and service was amazing! My server was fun and on top of things. The food was delicious especially the beer battered garli  fries!!! They accomodates me special request for the party and ensured we were ok witj everything! The beer selection was great as well. And the deal of getting a row of beers and a free pizza is always a good restaurant in my books! Will definitley be returning! ,5
 First time going here and i lived it.  The beer was great and so was the food.   I've already recommended it to several friends. ,5
" Good for couples hang out have some conversations, but for the service, not really what we expecting ",3
 Great beer. Service was fast and courteous. Altogether made my brief stop easy and enjoyable. ,5
" First time to this chain. Very empty and quiet on Jan 2 but that's ok. Seated right away, service initially was quick but towards the end we had to wave our waitress over to get the bill.  Food was OK. I had the beef stew which came with two very tiny pieces of baguette, no butter.  My friends flatbread (sorry I forget all the odd sounding names) looked fantastic and I wished that I had ordered from that section of the menu instead!  Overall, the price for beer brewed on site was FANTASTIC, food was tasty and I'd go back for sure. ",4
 Went for Winterlicious menu.  Food was great and you accommodated my garlic allergy.  Loved the Rolly Polly dessert. ,5
" Food was a good value for Winterlicious.  We were out for a company luncheon and there was 8 of us.  We were seated promptly however, our waiter seemed to be a bit snappy when taking the order and also when we asked for separate bills.  Other than that, food and atmosphere were pretty good. ",4
 Wine prices attricious.  3 people had grilled cheese. No one finished. Too noisy; should have checked atmosphere first. ,3
 A friend and I had brunch here on NYE. It was delicious. We had the Benny and the Fried Chicken and Crumpets. The portion was generous. I really liked the atmosphere and look forward to going back again to try dinner this time. ,5
 Upscale brew pub sports bar with very good food.  Great service. Not too noisy at all when we went.  They have screens for games but is not a typical noisy sports bar at all.  Imagine it would be busy after a TFC game.  But I would return for the food.  We all ordered fish and chips though there were other good options.  Fish and chips were very good.   We shared a fresh mini donut platter ( it's the holidays!) with yummy lavender custard and warm blueberry sauce.  Was perfect  for meeting up with some of my siblings over the holidays. ,4
" Always a great place to stop by for brunch. Haven't tried their dinner menu yet, but I'm sure it's also great. I miss the epic brunch poutine! Their smoker is what adds that special touch; always reminds me of camping. Highly recommended. ",5
 Food was ok - wish it was better because the service was awesome ,2
 Really cozy restaurant with a nice selection of beer brewed on site. ,5
 Such a cool spot for dinner out with friends! Great atmosphere and delicious food. ,5
" Had my mom and baba visiting from Niagara for the Royal Winter Fair.  From my home at Strachan/East Liberty and an elderly person, this was the perfect spot for us to spot to be active and walk to the fair, while having a pit stop for a lovely lunch that gave us the perfect break! Our server Cody was wonderful, and was very helpful for the indecisive at the table.  Thanks for the great service! ",4
" We were at Liberty Commons for a birthday party. The food, service, interior design were all good. Our waitress was quite friendly. Washrooms were exceptionally clean. Music choice they made was interesting. Hearing late 90s and early 00s pop songs  was surprising but OK. :) I’d recommend this place. ",5
 Manager and staff were amazing- can't wait to go again! ,5
 We've been served by very friendly Melanie who recommended us finest beer selection from a local microbrewery. Absolutely delicious experience. ,5
" Excellent as always, staff were amazing. New beers and menu items were enjoyed by all ",5
 Best brisket in the city ,5
" The food was decent, and was served promptly.  Not the best place for a quiet meal, but with a group this is a definite good choice. ",4
" Excellent service and a great atmosphere. E shared the calamari, it had a great crispy batter and portion size but seemed over cooked and too salty. For the meal I had the side ribs, not much to say here. Portion was lacking and taste was bland. The option for sides isn't available which left me with a potato salad in not fond of. She had the chicken korma. The dish itself was great, a good portion with full flavor. However, the naan bread is a left field personal twist that is far from authentic Indian which hurts this choice. The drink menu is limited and focused around cocktails mixed with beer leaving the non-beer people to tend for themselves in choices. Certainly something to be thought about. Now that the negative is out, the beer options are great. Flights at a reasonable price to sample some local brew. The atmosphere was great. Lots of tvs for sporting events with enough table privacy you can enjoy a date night to yourselves. And of you're a fan of big rock, head to their on site boutique, full of original gear and a few beer too. Overall, I'm heading back. They are getting on their feet with this new restaurant and service is worth the return. ",4
 Birthday Dinner ,5
" I enjoyed our table on the patio for a Saturday afternoon, pre-sports event at BMO field meeting with friends. The Classic Sampler flight of 4, 250 ml house brews I had ($10) was a good intro to the typical beers they brew. The Traditional Brown Ale was my favourite of the four. ",4
 My husband and I went for dinner before a concert on the weekend. I was leasantly surprised that this restaurant is also a micro brewery. They brew there own beer and we enjoyed the lager. We sat on the patio which was a nice setting and the wait staff were very attentive and on point. I would definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys pub food and beer. ,4
 I went with my boyfriend for our anniversary dinner. The food and service was great. I would definitely go again. ,5
 The service was very good. Prompt but not intrusive. Food came  quickly and was very tasty. Lighting was a little dim for reading the menu but overall the ambience was very good. ,3
" The music and sports screens made it more energetic, but made it noisy and we found it difficult to hear each other.  Even though the music was energetic, it was canned and we had to talk loud justto hear each other.  The service was great however. ",3
" Get ambiance, really good service, food was okay but not great. ",4
" We had a great server, unfortunately I cannot recall his name. ",4
 Get the mac n' cheese with bacon - it is the best! ,5
 Newly renovated.. an amazing place to enjoy a meal or drinks with friends. The micro-brewery has a great selection of beer to try. Well worth the trip. ,5
" The food, drinks and atmosphere was great. This was my second time here in two weeks. But this time our server was extremely rude and obnoxious. Its sad to say the one person's attitude was bad enough to ruin the visit for all of us. ",2
" The server here was very accommodating. Our friends called and they were going to be 49 min late. We had a show at the Budweiser Stage to get to so time was limited. The server helped us work out the time when to place our app order so it would arrive when they arrived- worked out perfect!! We felt it was a bit pricey, but the food was cereative for a pub! Server made it!! ",3
" Waitress was overloaded with tables - had to request another server take our order. Had to ask for drink refills 3 times.   Burger was requested with no bacon for religious reasons, arrived with bacon. Made a new one but took several minutes and no comp on bill or apology for the mistake.  Overall was much below our expectations. ",2
" Fantastic food in a funky, industrial underground  atmosphere. Interesting flavours of beer and cocktails and the marrying of different flavours in the appetizers and dishes was a treat. We'll be back. ",5
" Was there for summerlicious, had the lamb burger for main, it was delicious. They also have really good happy hour deals! ",5
 Our waitress Victoria was awesome! She remembered the little things which most servers don't. Fun twists on classic dishes. All Canadian wine list. Will be back for sure. ,5
" Food was good. Service was hilarious. Everyone there was really cool and easy to chat with. Love their drink selection.  I asked for the patio when I arrived, but they said no when I could see many open tables and no Reserved signs. When my friend arrived, she pushed for patio and they did seat us there after cleaning a table. The patio just opened the day before, so I couldn't make note on the reservation.    It's a great patio! Ask for it when you make a reservation!! ",4
 Food is good. Very nice pub. ,3
" Second time coming there. i owe you a review from my first visit. great staff, great menu. fairly priced. will definitely be coming back! ",4
" this is a great location! Great ambience but:  1) The server was spaced out.  Kept asking us what we wanted to drink after we told her 5 times, asking us if we wanted a drink when the drinks were still full! Did not understand and admitted that she did not know how summerlicious worked.  2) My son's burger was burnt and tasted burnt!  3) Ribs on my winterlicious platter were cold.   Give it some time to work things out before we even think about trying it again anytime soon.  It is too bad because we thought it would be great. ",2
 father's day brunch - nice brunch options.  Service was very friendly and attentive.  Loved the beer tasting options.  Ended up buying a giant jug of beer from the retail shop on our way out.  thanks very much! ,4
" Stumbled upon this place on Mother's Day but unfortunately it was reservation only..so I proactively booked for Father's Day. Dined with my hubby and our one year old. The place is huge a beautiful. The food was really great, and as my husband put it ""the best English breakfast since the Bristol"". They even gave us a free beer for Dad. Would totally consider going back for a TFC game or to plan an event in the barrel room. ",5
 Our servers were friendly &amp; we liked the casual vibe of the place. We went for brunch - really enjoyed our meal. Left feeling satisfied &amp; the food was delish!  Will be back. ,4
 This was my first visit to Sweet Georgia's Juke Joint. I received excellent customer service and the food was good. I will definitely go again and have already recommended it to some of my co-workers as a place to try for lunch. We were also fortunate to meet the owner and his party on our way out. He was very hospitable and appreciative of our support. I hope that people will support it. ,5
" This was my second time at Sweet Georgia's.The first time I went was on a Saturday night. The band was rockin' and the food was awesome. Unfortunately the service was extremely slow. We waited 30 minutes for an appetizer &amp; and hour for our food. This last time I went during the day for lunch. Once again, the live music was nice &amp; the food was great...but the wait time was still long. We waited about 40 minutes. Overall, its a great experience. But be prepared to wait. Perhaps its just best to have a snack before you go to Sweet Gerogia's.... ",3
" Sweet Georgia Juke Joint was an epic fail. While the cuisine was good, the customer service leaves much to be desired. Would not recommend until they've had an opportunity to develop a professional host and service team; that recommends the importance of professionalism and effective customer service. ",2
" The Ambiance was great! We had a girls night out celebrating a birthday. Our server Jasmine was very nice and accomodating. The food was good; However, the side items potions were small like tapas style. A little disappointing considering it was a full dinner menus. The crab cakes were awesome! ",3
" Good music, live band. Would recommend reservations. service and staff are good. Portions are good as well. ",3
 I went here for Sunday brunch and was surprised that I was able to change my reservation. I was late but they still accommodated me. The hostess was polite and welcoming. At the table the waitress gave great reviews for the moonshine list. I had the prefect selection of the moonshine mule. It packed a punch! We ordered our food and it took almost 20 minutes. The place wasn't busy and people who sat after got out food. Service was slow. When our food came the talipia was so undercooked it looked like the fillet had been seared. The waitress took it back and the manager apologized and offered complimentary dessert with a new meal. The waitress advocated for us to get a free Dessert and meal. I appreciated that. We didn't take the. Up in Fraser because we had waited long ended ugh and I had a flight to catch. The fried chicken greens fried green tomatoes and sweet potatoes were good.  Music was in point. Enjoyed myself but definetly will explore other Sunday brunches in town before returning. ,3
" Food is always delicious, I would recommend sitting in the diner area instead of at the bar. Service is much slower at the bar area. ",5
 The food was fabulous but it took 35 minutes to come out and we were the second customers to be seated for our 11:00 am reservation.   We didn't stay long enough for the   music but will visit for drinks and music next time we are in town again. ,3
" Tried this place for the first time on a date and it was perfect. The live Jazz and general ambiance were lively and engaging. Despite the noise level, I was still able to have a great conversation. Also, the Service was speedy and efficient. AND THE FOOD WAS AMAZING. I had the Chicken and Waffles and the chicken was perfectly cooked and seasoned and perfectly paired with the waffle. I recommend this place often and look forward to visiting again. ",5
 Celebrated my birthday here.  Great food and drinks.  Band acknowledged those celebrating birthdays and anniversaries.  Nice welcome to ATL!!!! ,4
" It was my 1st visit. Enjoyed the Trio band, the food, great atmosphere. Yes, I recommend this spot. ",5
" Always on the list as a ""must go"" when I am in Atlanta for work.  The food is amazing (had the Maple Glazed Chicken this time, with sides of collard greens and mac -n-cheese - YUM), and the band was awesome.  Always a fun time.  A definite hit with my colleagues.  I'll be back again for sure next time I'm in Atlanta. ",5
" Manager with keys to wine was not there so wines were limited, which makes no sense ",4
 The music was phenomenal!!! Cocktail tasted like sour mix on the rocks. Jambalaya pasta very amateurish but ok. Fried chicken and mac and cheese was delish. Music was the best part! Our waitress was brand new but very good. ,4
" Great food, I had he moonshine chicken with mac n cheese and greens, my husband had the shrimp and grits, we both enjoyed! The music was good too! It was our first time and we will definitely return. ",5
 I don't know what all the bad reviews are about but this place is great! We have date night every Thursday and we will be back for another round. The food was great Service was excellent. No complaints here. Our server was super attentive and friendly. ,5
 Birthday celebration ,5
" Fabulous food, excellent service, phenomenal music! We'd go again in a heartbeat! Reservations are a must. ",5
" I loved our evening at Sweet Georgia's. The atmosphere is great, although the music that night was too loud... and I have hearing problems. In spite of that, we loved hearing local favorite, Regina Troupe and her trio which included a dynamite female drummer and great keyboard guy.  A couple who got up and danced to one number brought tears to my eyes for their beautiful moves. I liked the fried chicken, but especially enjoyed the black-eyed peas salad and fried green tomatoes. One of the greatest surprises for me was an incredible mural on the wall by an artist named Stacey Brown (I looked him up). This exciting work is truly unique. I thought epitomized the spirit and joy of the place. ",4
 The food was great! ,4
 Everything was excellent! So good we are going again tonight before we leave town. ,5
 When seated the waitress walked pass us three times before acknowledging us then wasn't very friendly when ask about menu and prices. ,1
 Sunday brunch was adequate. Asked for hot sauce twice and never saw it. Waitress was MIA. Will not go back again. ,3
 It was a great day for my parents. They had never visited before and looking forward to me bringing them back. ,4
" Gary, our server, was excellent! He made my 50th Birthday Brunch bearable. Of the many times I've been here, the food was uncharacteristically mediocre this visit and not to the standard I've come to expect. The sides tasted warmed up, not fresh. The wings were great, but the other chicken, not so much. I bragged about this place and let my guests down. I'm gonna venture to say that Team B was on duty! ",3
 Open table references full menu which is not current. Was looking for choice between meatloaf and shrimp &amp; grits from other reference.  Not available.  Music was fun and atmosphere enjoyable but not really sure it's worth an extra $5 pp in the middle of the week. Band only played about 60% of the time we were there. ,4
" Good food, music, and date night atmosphere.  My husband and I were celebrating our anniversary and we will be back for future date nights. ",4
 We thoroughly enjoyed our first dining experience at Sweet Georgia's.  The food was very good and the service was great.  We'll definitely return the next time we're in Atlanta. ,5
" This place is incredible.  From the convenience of valet parking, the service,  the food, to the band everything was exceptional.  I took my wife out for her birthday and she had a wonderful time.  She had so much fun, she and the rest of my family ended up singing along with the band. ",5
 My wife and I really enjoyed  everything. The owner and the musician came over to talk. We will be coming back ,5
 Everything was great! ,5
" Parking is Very confusing.  The outside of two parking lots have the same Number 717, then when you get your ticket it has 171. I felt as though this is purposely done for one of the lots to make $3.00. ",5
" Perfect for friends getting together. The music level was perfect.  While they played, we could still have a conversation.  Both food, music and service was great. ",5
" Great food, loved the atmosphere. Spent the day visiting the Coke factory and aquarium, ending with a nice dinner and live entertainment at this establishment. Easily walking distance away from the above attractions (approx 20 min walk). Will definitely be returning next time I'm in the Atlanta area. ",5
 Slow service (extremely slow) and mediocre food. Our food was cold (fried okra is terrible cold). ,1
 Amazing food and amazing live music. I had the moonshine chicken and the peach cobbler ,5
" If you're in the mood for great (but very loud) music and good southern food-this is your place! My husband and I went our first night in Atlanta and it was the perfect start to the weekend. I had the fried chicken, and the portion was large enough that I'm eating it for lunch as I write this. It was crunchy and had a sweet drizzle of honey... delicious! My husband had the pulled pork and it was tender and the BBQ sauce was awesome. The baked beans were delicious too, I almost forgot to mention that. We enjoyed the music and the musicians all during dinner. They enjoy what they do and it's contagious. It made you dance in your seats! One last thing, do not miss the peach cobbler-to die for! Loved this place! ",4
 Too darn noisy to hear myself think.  Cut down the volume.  Server could not hear us and shew screwed up order.  You need more meat &amp; potato offerings. ,1
 Great food.  Really enjoyed the 2 jazz bands with my lady. ,5
 It was a pleasant experience we will definitely revisit this venue ,4
" First time at location with reservations. Came here for pre Mother's Day Celebration. The ambience was very nice and band was awesome. Customer service from both manager and waiter was terrible. The head chef was friendly and apologized with mistake that happened with our desserts. All in all I will be back at the location but I know what waitress not to work with along with the female manager.  Terrible first experience with my mother and I, but I won't let their terrible attitudes stop me from visiting again. Hopefully a second visit will be better. ",2
 Awesome experience! Great food and live entertainment! ,5
" it wasn't what the ""hype"" made it out to be. probably would continue to try other spots ! ",3
 We enjoyed the night and band. It was my husband's birthday we invited another couple to join us.  The service was great. Thanks for making the night special. ,5
 The atmosphere was great for the birthday celebration and the band was on point! ,5
 It was my birthday and I had a great time.  Server was very attentive. ,5
 Awesome bands enjoyed it a lot good good great drinks ,5
" We visited on a Sunday and while we asked if it was always so busy, and staff said not always, IT WAS SUNDAY BRUNCH!  Our waiter and all the waitstaff seemed stretched very thin.  Getting a refill on a $5 cup (and I mean cup, not big mug) took us asking as well as at least 20 minutes.  Those in my party of  four who ordered the lunch options-pulled pork sandwich, fried chicken, fried green tomatoes-said their food was decent, but my French Toast and bacon was subpar and soggy.  Disappointing after the waiter recommended it and after a long wait.  I worked food service for years and understand that the server isn't to blame for food taste and quality, nor for being overworked during a busy shift, but the entire experience could have been much better.  We had to ask twice for our checks and even that took much longer than needed.  The restaurant takes reservations and while last-minute parties were likely accommodated, it seems they were grossly understaffed given the popularity and proximity to hotels and events like festivals and sports events that would draw a brunch crowd.  Maybe the evening is a different experience but for my money, I'll try somewhere else if I'm in town again. ",3
" Was there celebrating our 32 Anniversary.  Both my wife and I enjoyed the atmosphere, service and food tremendously! The only problem I had was that my parking validation did not work! ",4
" While the food was good, it took a looooooong time for the food to come to the table and it was by no means crowded.  Also we had two orders of chicken at our table and they were inconsistent in the ""fry"".  Other than that a nice Sunday Brunch locale. ",2
 Had an amazing time! Food was delicious and fast! Entertainment was awesome! ,5
 I had a wonderful time eating dinner here. I brought my girl for her birthday. The service was great and the live show was spectacular. I enjoyed the food as well as the  service. ,5
 Very nice table was ready when we walked in! I wish the appetizer had been brought out before dinner instead of the same time! The band was amazing and very engaging! ,4
 I have enjoyed coming.  Over a two week period I have brought family from out of town to experience Sweet GA Junk Joint.  Each time they have enjoyed coming keep up the good work. ,5
" The band was fantastic. The shrimp and grits were 5 star. The Fried Chicken 3 Star, collards 1 Star (bland), mac cheese 3 star. Elevate the cocktails if the syrupy moonshine punch is a reflection. Pricey for the food cost. ",4
 Great place to chill and enjoy good live music and the food and drinks were amazing. ,5
 Perfect environment to have a date ,5
" The food, service and ambiance was great!!! The band was awesome! ",5
 Always a wonderful experience at the Juke Joint. ,5
 Food was great!  Especially the chicken and waffles.  Our server was excellent and the atmosphere was very friendly.  Fun atmosphere and good music.  We will definitely be back! ,5
" My friends and I had a very good time enjoying the ambiance, food, and music! ",5
" Great food, drinks and entertainment.  Our servers was tops!!!!! ",5
 Best fried chicken ever!  Musicians are definitely worth the $5 entertainment charge! ,4
 One of my favorite spots! Takes too long for the band @ times but overall...great! ,5
 Food was great but service was slow. Not sure if the problem was in the kitchen or with the server. Server was very nice but the food took too long to come out ,3
" Sweet... from front to back of the house. Our server ""Q"" was gracious with lots of southern hospitality and personality. ",5
" Food was awesome, drinks were pricey, music was fantastic.  I can only give the service 3 stars. We had a reservation, but they took 30 mins to seat us. One of the hostesses messed up the seating. When I asked about the delay, she pointed the finger to another hostess(she was right) but there was no apology or any kind of comp. Our waiter was great though! ",4
" My son told about the Sweet Georgia Juke Joint and I was coming to Atlanta anyway everything was awesome food ,cocktails and especially the live entertainment. I would totally recommend this place this is a must ",5
" I tried this place because I saw good reviews and I knew s few people that had been already.  It was JUST OKAY! It did not WOW at all.  There was nothing really on the menu I really liked. Ended up with shrimp and grits.  The grits was more like polenta. I've had better. Shrimp was underseasoned.  The waitress was nice, I assumed maybe overwhelmed. She didn't come but a few times literally to check back.  The food took literally about 20 min to get out.  The other person had salmon.   It was any apps ordered or anything outside the entree but a couple that came in after us, got their food wayyyyy faster than I did and they ordered wayyyyy more.  The 1st band was really loud to me but the 2nd band was really good. Overall I give it a 3.  Because I hate downtown, I probably wouldn't go back anytime soon especially having to pay for the expensive food and parking. ",3
 The food selection for brunch was very limited. The food was just ok. The ambience was shabby. The tables are small and the dining area was congested. They charged $5 per person for entertainment in addition to your meal. The band that performed was terrible and played for 10 mins. That was a complete ripoff. That was my first time there and my last. Other guest concurred with me. ,1
" I loved the food, and our server was the absolute best. What I don't like is the $5 fee for live music if they decide to play while you're there. I think it should be an option to if you want it or not. I honestly would never eat there if I had to listen to music I didn't want to hear. ",5
 Mac and No cheese had rosemary which was overpowering so much so that's all I tasted noodles where over cooked very mushy. Collard greens undercooked no seasoning I Couldn't even taste the smoked turkey. 1/2 rack of ribs a little dry thank God for bbq sauce. Fried 1/2 chicken crispy on the outside juicy on the inside cooked well; however lacked seasoning a sprinkle of salt after frying goes a long way. Mash potatoes ok. Atmosphere very nice. Nice place to have a drink and listen to the band. ,2
 food not great!  music wonderful. staff wonderful. great place to visit if on business or vacation  Thursday evening was just ok! ,5
" Good atmosphere, great food. The music was nice and jazzy. I really think the fried green tomatoes were awesome. ",5
 Great food and ambiance! Awesome entertainment! Great date night with hubby! ,5
 Spent the weekend in the city and decided to go to listen to some good live music and once again I was not let down.  The many times that I have dined at Sweet Georgia's I have always enjoyed the live music.  I ordered the crab cakes..OMG I live for those crabs cakes and the pulled pork..I am not a fan of the pulled pork but the BBQ sauce is good.  My guy got the salmon which he liked...All in all a solid spot for date night ,4
 Great place for friends night out. Band was good and food was amazing. Would definitely go back again. ,4
 I came here with family that was visiting from OH. We had an AMAZING time! The music was awesome.. Our server was teally friendly and knowledgeable of the menu.. And did I mention the music?!!! I will be returning!! ,5
 Myesha was the most exquisite waitress we've ever had. Extremely efficient and friendly. ,5
 Great food and ambiance! There was a band playing live music as well! Food was incredible. Get the Peach Cobbler!! ,5
" The band Soul Cartel was high energy, an our Server, Mr. Eddie was top shelf. ",5
" Portion of pulled pork was very small for $20.00. It was good, but the Mac and cheese was awful and the peach cobbler was a huge disappointment. Fried green tomatoes were the thinnest I've ever been served. Need to be thicker to be enjoyed. I would go back if they fixed all that. ",4
" Great food, great atmosphere!!! The live music was awesome!! We attended on a Sunday during brunch. ",5
 HORRIBLE experience... I made a reservation to entertain and feed my family after they drove 6 hours from NC . Arrived for 5pm reservation and was seated at 5:15. There was no crowd or other parties waiting at the time. Once seated and ordered our food ... the server forgot to put in our order and it took and hour and half before she even noticed no food had touched our table. After speaking with management they had the nerve to offer me dessert and to comp our drinks. I was insulted. If you visit be sure to pay attention to your server because management isn't. ,2
 Visit the restaurant on fathers day - Our first time dining there and everything was awesome especially my waiter she was great! ,5
" We dine here on Father's Day. I did like that i was called to confirm i was still coming for my reservation. We were seated within a decent amount of time. The server was nice enough. We ordered the  pulled pork sandwich with mac and baked beans, fried chicken and greens. The pork was sooo salty, the mac and  baked beans were just awful. The mac tasted dried out like left overs. The greens tasted like they came from a can and the chicken has honey on it, so its sweet. I sent my meal back for a burger and fries. The patty was super thick and small. I had more bread than meat, but it was good and so were the fries. The drink (the ceely) was really good. If I want a good drink i would come back, but i wouldn't for the food. ",3
 The service was beyond terrible. I walked in for a 2:30pm reservation and the hostess told me hold on she's having a conversation with her staff members. After waiting 10 mins my gf and i  were finally seated. 35 mins passed and not one single waitress asked us if we'd like a drink. So we ended up walking out. Was highly disappointed for a top 10 restaurant in atlanta. ,1
 I ordered the catfish and grits. When the first order came out the grits were cold...like no heat to them at all. My waitress was missing for a while so another gentleman returned my meal for me. They were very nice about it. The meal that my boyfriend has was great. No complaints. He had the braised short ribs. It was awesome. ,4
 Awesome time  Great music and wonderful drinks and food ,5
" We went to Sun Brunch &amp; the food was just ok. Flavorless chicken, hard dry waffle. The veggies were just ok &amp; we did not like the $5 live band fee per person. The band was not good to us or the table next to us! If they want a band they need to pay for the band upfront or up there prices to afford them. It is tacky to do this. Had we known this we would have booked somewhere else &amp; not taken an Uber there from our hotel.  I have eaten at the location in the airport &amp; the food was Much better! ",2
 The fried chicken was fantastic ,5
 Very good basic southern food Good music and vibes ,4
" Let me start by saying that the music was good, however everything else about my experience at Sweet Georgia Juke Joint was terrible.  Our appetizer went to the wrong table and when we finally received the wings we ordered they were cold.  I ordered shrimp and grits and my husband ordered the fried chicken with 2 sides.  My grits were cold (in the middle of the bowl of grits) and so were his sides.  I personally will not return. ",2
 This place was a blast! Service and food were solid as well! ,4
 We enjoyed the food and the experience ,5
 Did not like the deviled eggs or cole slaw..did not taste freshly prepared. ,4
" My family and I took our parents there to celebrate their 32nd anniversary and we all enjoyed ourselves! Service was awesome, food was tasty, and the live band was on point! I was able to slip in a shout out to my parents for the special occasion as well :) ",5
" I loved it!! The food, service, atmosphere and band were great but I hated the $5 entertainment fee per person. That was not the best. I don't get charged that at other places that have live music. Otherwise, all was great!! ",5
" The service and the food was good. The mimosas tasted more like orange juice than a mixture, but I enjoyed them. Nice and light for a Sunday brunch. ",4
" One of the best live music/food venues in Atlanta.  Great food, generous portions, good pricing, great Southern hospitality.  Reservations needed as wait times always exist. ",5
" I think the manger and the hostess should work on their customer service and not brush us off like we're bothering them.  Our server was great, very friendly!! Other than the manager, I had a good experience ",4
" The band was great, good food, service was good just can't hear while the band is playing. ",5
 Great place! Will always come back to eat! Great food ,5
 Food was good. Service was better. Friendly fast and fantastic. The staff is obviously invested in making sure customers are taken care of and they had just the right balance of attentiveness without smothering. ,4
" Went here to treat a friend to dinner for his birthday this past Tuesday. I was not impressed. He said his food good so I'm happy about that. I don't eat meat so I checked the menu before I left. Ordered a veggie plate. The okra was lukewarm and salty, the mashed potatoes were sorry, and the broccoli. Well, kinda hard to mess that up. The service was slooooow. The musician did his thing though! He was a one-man band. I doubt I'd return. ",2
" The cocktails were superb! Try the 'Sneaky Sneaky' and the ""Moonshine Mule'. On the menu,  the jambalaya pasta was perfectly seasoned, as was the braised beef (uber soft!). And the live music was great too. ",4
" Fun enviroment, wonderful staff very knowledgeable about the menu with a bubbly personality. We went early to beat the crowds and I'm glad we did it, there was nice music by a piano player but not so loud we couldn't talk. As we were leaving the place was packed and a band was getting ready to play. It looked like it would be a fun environment but the atmosphere we had when we were eating was perfect for our group at the time. ",4
" I walked to Sweet Georgia's Juke Joint from my hotel. It wasn't far, but because Atlanta doesn't boast a truly straight street and satellite reception is iffy downtown I got a little (not much) lost. Not SGJJ's fault, just  a warning that you should be sure you know how to get there if you aren't staying nearby.   I was alone so I chose a hightop table in the bar area. It was clean enough, but then my waitress dropped off some used cocktail napkins at my table on her way by. That was definitely weird. She probably didn't realize they had been used, but honestly, who picks up napkins from one table and gives them to another customer?!? I ordered a  Down South cocktail right away--it was divine, but took a long time to get, and I had to ask for a glass of water.   For my food, I ordered Juke bacon and eggs for my appetizer, and the pulled pork with Parmesan cheese grits and fried green tomatoes for my sides. I got the appetizer relatively quickly and it was good, but was something I could have made at home, so not special--just good. My waitress asked me twice to remind her what sides I got and still brought out the mac 'n cheese instead of grits, then when I finally got her attention to get this corrected (which took a long time since she was standing and chatting with the customers to my right) it took a while to get the grits. They were good, but again, not special. The fried green tomatoes, though, were heavenly.  The pulled pork was delicious, but very unevenly pulled and I had a couple of huge chunks mixed in with the rest. That was okay, but indicates a lack of attention to detail that was disappointing. Also, I'm pretty sure the BBQ sauce they brought with it was not housemade--it tasted an awful lot like Sweet Baby Ray's (which is good, but not ""signature"" as advertised in the menu).   SWJJ was a fun atmosphere, but the food wasn't really better than what I could cook at home, and when I eat out on the company's dime I like meals to be more special than that. ",3
 Very attentive and friendly service.  Fried green tomatoes! ,5
" The Live band was very good; however,  the place closed at 10 pm which is early for a ""Juke Joint.""   The service was good and the server was very nice but that could have been the $65 tip included on the bill.  The food was expensive and the portions were small.  My bill was over $400 for a group of 8.  If I visited the Juke Joint again, it would be  for the entertainment and drinks but not the food. ",2
" We weren't ask if we wanted to sit in the dining area, taking away our choice to pay the $5 per person entertainment fee. However, she asked the party in front of us. The food was mediocre at best. The band played one song and then left. We paid $10 for one song. The server was great and that was the only good part of the visit. Will not return. ",2
" My wife and I drove down to Atlanta from Greenville, SC to get away, hang out in the city and celebrate my birthday (February 23rd).  Sweet Georgia's Juke Joint was highly recommended to us to enjoy the food, atmosphere and live band.   We, along with our goddaughter who lives in Atlanta,  arrived at 7:45pm on Thursday, February 23rd but were highly disappointed when, shortly after we were seated, we were told that ""there were some issues with the band"" so they would not be showing up.  We ended up staying and eating, and a gentleman came out and played the keyboard and song for a few minutes, but it did not measure up to the experience we were looking forward to, or ""the hype"" to which this place was recommended to us.   In the future, we will call and make sure that the band is there, and playing, should we ever decide to return to your establishment. ",3
" I've tried Sweet Georgia's Juke Joint on multiple occasions and have only enjoyed the food once... when it first opened many years ago. I've gone back several times but still not impressed.  The food is average, which makes the prices higher than the quality/taste of the food in return.  I was there with 2 others and we all shared the same opinion. Another thing I find distasteful is the $5 entertainment fee if you sit in the dining room, where you must also purchase an entree. To me the purchase of an entree should waive the entertainment fee.  My waitress personable and nice, and the live entertainment was great. But not sure that's enough to get me to return. ",3
" Solid southern fare. Terrific three piece soul-influenced band. Perfect volume, crowd interaction. Friendly, great service, fun. Nice decor as well. Highly recommended. ",5
" We came here as our last meal of vacation for my birthday! The hostess was amazing. She was so sweet and helpful. She made sure to let us know their dining rules BEFORE we sat down so we weren't hit with any subjects (just that there's a $5 per person charge for live entertainment.) She got us a table quickly, was able to accommodate a request we had, AND stood with us while we waited for our Lyft home. She offered us suggestions for future transportation and ideas to get around. Her service deserves 5 stars. The service after here was not as promising. We waited 15 minutes before even being offered water. Someone from the kitchen saw us sitting there and went to find a server. We had to find him two more times throughout the meal. He did refill our drinks any time they got low though.   The food was to die for. We were sooo glad we came. We had fried crawfish as our appetizer, amazing! I am very picky when it comes to fried chicken, but I took a chance and ordered it. It was great I have no regrets. My boyfriend ordered the Jambalaya pasta. This was easily one of the best meals I've ever had (yes he let me try some). I wish I could get it shipped home to CT. Next time we come to Atlanta, I'll definitely return for this pasta. Last but not least, the best part of my meal and possibly my trip was the peach cobbler. I'm sure anyone around me who saw my face was judging me because I was in heaven. Sooooo good. I'd recommend the restaurant to anyone who loves good food. ",5
" My family dine here frequently and as of late the service is not what it use to be. My guest   and I waited 40 min (with a 2:30 reservation) to be seated. My wife and I flew into ATL to meet our guest who also traveled a distance to dine at your establishment. The hostess demonstrated poor customer service (however our waiter was great). When I finally spoke with the manager we were seated 15 min later. I often bring my family and business clients to the Juke Joint because of the atmosphere, food and service...unfortunately the later has not been impressive our last few visits.    Ronnie and Sheila Hooten ",3
 It was very good atmosphere and great music ,5
 Enjoyed the live entertainment of Lola and her band. ,3
" The service at the bar was a little slow, but the drinks were delicious. Best fried chicken I'd had in ages! The shrimp and grits were also amazing! The live music was fantastic as well. Would definitely return. ",4
 We were there celebrating our 31st wedding anniversary. It our first visit.  The atmosphere was wonderful. The band was outstanding and we appreciated the oldies but goodies. We look forward to our next visit to Atlanta. Sweet Juke Joint will definitely be given a return visit by us. ,5
" Great..cool ambiance.. Music was FABULOUS!!  ""Lola and friends""  they're great!!  Will come back just to see them. ",5
 The service was horrible. The food was cold. I left to eat elsewhere after paying 75 dollars. I will never attend again.. I called the manage and they were no help.. Worst ever.. ,1
 Good food and festive atmosphere.  Don't plan to have much conversation -- the music is the center of attention. ,4
 The glazed salmon was awesome! We also had the peach cobbler and the apple bread pudding were amazing. ,5
" The food was AWFUL!  Server was nice and the atmosphere was nice.  I would go back for a drink and listen to music, but I would eat before I got there.  Please change that mac and cheese recipe, it tastes like spoiled milk. ",1
" Great food, lots of drink options and awesome ambiance! ",4
" Great choice for our company holiday lunch, a group of 12. Service was fantastic and the Server recommendations were solid.  Service was attentive for both food and drinks.   The only mistep were the natchos which we found very salty.  Other than that everyone was happy with their mains as well as desserts.  Great new addition to the neighbourhood! ",4
" Great place, clean, and great staff. Great service. ",4
" Great food, excellent value. Beer is really good and well priced, and martinis are only $8, fantastic. ",5
 Service was good but the food was really bad. I don't think anyone in my party enjoyed their food. ,2
" Service was solid - polite and nice. The location itself is pretty cool as well. The food was awful not only in terms of price, but sheer quality. If you want a beer, this is a good place to go. If you want to eat, don't bother, it'd be a waste of money. ",1
 Worst service that I have ever received at a 3 Breweries. We got our meals before our drinks. The waitress could not understand what a Rye and Diet Coke was....I kept getting different mixes and she had to keep coming back and ask me over and over again what my drink choice was. My coworker had a beer sampler and the waitress took it away when she still had a full beer sample to go through. We went there for lunch and we were there 2 hours because service was so bad.  Tables around us that came before and after had finished up and left well before we could. Each table seemed to have their own dedicated server....I found that very odd. ,2
 I had a decent experience here. Parking is hard to find but the location is convenient and easy to find. The food was pretty good and the service was good. The place was a little cluttered and the owner should consider updating the chairs and tables because they are a little bit raggedy. There is a $5 per person charge added to the bill for the live band.... the band was just okay. ,3
" We expected a real southern flavor,it was not there. The chicken wings were a little large and slightly undercooked Not  cooked as requested “ well cooked, crispy. For the price of an entree with only one side is a little difficult to swallow. The peach cobbler was not a cobbler at all, it was a joke. Staff was a little too busy trying to wait and clear tables at the same time. This was my first visit and to say the least I was totall disappointed. Good luck and best wishes . ",2
" The atmosphere is unique and welcoming. I loved the upbeat Jazz band. Our waiter was very attentive and had a delightful personality. I ordered the fried chicken with Mac &amp; cheese and collard greens. Excellent meal and outstanding flavor! My husband had the chicken and waffles &amp; he equally loved his meal. The mimosas were flowing. No complaints here, all smiles. Going back this Sunday! ",5
 Very nice brunch ,5
 Very fun! We were here for a conference and were pleasantly surprised when we arrived here.  It was very energetic and great food! ,5
 Amazing! A great Atlanta experience. ,5
" I was hoping for livelier jazz, not the ""smoky"" jazz of the trio that performed. ",3
" Everything about this place was awesome!!!  I had Salmon which was great, fried green tomatoes and mashed potatoes!!!  There was a band there the night we went, they were awesome!!!! We danced off our awesome food!!!! ",5
 Brought my parents here for their 41st anniversary. They love the place the food was amazing the band was great and the service was good. We will be coming back here again. ,5
" Our waiter was not too friendly.  There were a lot of items left behind in the kitchen that we had to tell her that we did not get.  So I guess that may have agitated her.  The music was great.  I have been there 3 times total and this one was the worst.  Overall I enjoy bringing my out of town guest there for brunch and the music.  Thanks, Vicki Ryan. ",3
 It was a very nice place and I loved the live entertainment. Will definitely be going back! ,5
 Good food! Got the chicken and waffles! Traditional fried chicken wings and sweet waffle and warm maple syrup. Friend got the BBQ sandwich which was also delicious. A must if you want to do brunch right! ,5
" The atmosphere of the restaurant was fantastic and the food was delicious. Our party had a great time catching up. Classic Southern food with a twist, all of it very tasty. Moonshine and whiskey cocktails to be had in abundance. The peach cobbler is dangerous, so save room for it. The only thing diners should be aware of is there is an up-charge of $5/person during the live music portion of the evening. I'm not sure if this goes to pay the band, or what, but it seemed odd to me. Overall, a great restaurant in the heart of the city. ",5
 The food was great and the service was too.  Great music ,5
 The entertainment was the best part of the evening. The food was average. ,4
" The music was awesome, the food was  ""okay "" and the service was a bit disappointing.  The server kept disappearing for LONG periods of time to the point where we had to ask other servers for stuff.  I would   definitely go back there for the live music!! ",4
 Too noisy for business meeting. Food was ok. Not for calorie conscious audience. Peach cobbler was awesome. ,4
" Great food, great service! Live music was excellent! ",5
" Great service, great Jazz for a relaxing night after a long flight. Tasty food, not pricey. ",4
" Hubby didn't like his waffle said it was bland nothing spectacular. Although we enjoyed the catfish appetizer and I enjoyed my fried chicken, collards and mac and cheese. ",4
 Had the jambalaya pasta.  Sauce was tasty with just the right amount of spice.  The penne was overcooked with most of the tubes split down the middle.  I think it would be better done with rice rather than pasta. ,4
 Business dinner with co-workers.  We enjoyed everything about this dining experience.  The food and drinks were perfect.  Accompanied by an amazing live band that enhanced a perfect outing. ,5
" Nice venue aesthetically,  but the service was pretty slow and impersonal. Extra ""entertainment charge"" per person, and the requirement to order certain menu items. The band played a 20 minute medley of numbers with no break between, then took a break between ""sets"".   Not a great value, and the food was just average. All in all, not worth a repeat visit. ",3
 Great live music bands!!! Choices of food were excellent! Everyone in our party was satisfied with their food and drinks!! ,5
" Great place, so welcoming, fantastic live music and just a good place to be. Fantastic atmosphere. ",5
 This place was excellent!! The food was great mixed with a great band! That was the perfect place to take my husband on his birthday!! We will definitely come back!! ,5
 This spot is a must visit in downtown ATL. The food was amazing with local flavors and southern deliciousness. The service was attentive and very helpful. The music and the bands that added to the experience rounded off the experience to make this a must visit spot! ,5
" Everything from the moment we stepped in was perfect and I can't wait to return. The staff was friendly and prompt. I had the fried chicken with mac and cheese and baked beans, while my wife had the shrimp and grits. Both dishes were amazing! I'd recommend both easily. ",5
 Very nice restaurant for late afternoon and evening hangout.  Food was delicious and the service (Mr. Yousef) was awesome!  Will definitely go again. ,5
 Great food and entertainment was top notch! I highly recommend this restaurant. ,5
 The music and atmosphere were really great.  The food was okay.  I will be back to order other options to try out other items on the menu. ,4
 Great food and entertainment ,5
" Server has a very nice smile,she was not attentive or anticipatory. My son and i had to ask for drink refills,our table was clutered with our appetizer dishes and we had to wait on our check even though we were 2 if the last guest. Our table was wobbly as well. ",3
" The food was amazing, the service was impeccable, the music was full of fun! ",5
 HAD A GREAT TIME WILL COME BACK MY SEATING WAS GREAT ENTERTAINMENT WAS  GREAT MY SERVER WAS EXCELLENT I ENJOYED MYSELF VERY ENTERTAINING ,5
" Enjoyed the dining experience, although the server didn't ask anything about if it was a special occasion or if it was our first visit.  It was both.  Our time there as we just moved to Atlanta and also it was my Birthday. ",4
 Amazing venue! Phenomenal southern food. Had both the chicken and waffles and sampled the shrimp and grits. Delicious! Live music was enjoyable and love the fact they support local artists. A must visit for those both local and visiting Atlanta! ,5
 The staff are friendly and  professional.  I loved and enjoyed the band - Baatin &amp; Top Secret .  A variety of food.  The food was delicious. ,5
" First visit to Atlanta and this was across the street from our hotel.  Picked it out of convenience but was so glad we got to experience some true Atlanta culture. The band was creat, the crowed was juke-ing! Danced all night from my chair.... wish I got up and danced with the crowed of ladies! So much fun!! ",5
 I received an email saying I didn't respect the reservation. I did! ,1
" We were seated at the far end of the restraint with no view. However, we requested to change the seat, and they accommodated our request. so, we seated at the table with a nice ocean view. I felt very comfortable, so I called my daughter who lives near by to join with us. We had a nice dinner. thank you. ",4
" Lots of great wines, and phenomenal food. It's pricey, but foodies know that great food is worth it. ",5
 Very Chic - great view - European decor - terrific and friendly service - food was excellent although some dishes were more stellar than others... the escargot/mushrooms is awesome...meat is top notch and the presentation is attractive and eye catching. I'd highly recommend this restaurant for that special occasion. ,4
" Hostess made a comment about havingredients to seat us in the bar because there were no specifications on the table request. A) this was rude, B) a need to do so was not clear on the booking form. Why would you have to use bar seating as default? ",3
 The table we had was very close to the door and very drafty.  Our server was nice enough but not present when we needed her.  One person in our party ordered a burger with only ketchup and got his smothered in mayo.  They told us to make a new one would take time and boy did it ever.  Everyone was finished he did not even have his.  We were very surprised since the restaurant was not at all busy.  Not our best visit and glad we weren't in a rush. ,3
 We went for New Years Eve diner before going to the movies it wasn’t our first choice but it good food and good start for our evening. Same sports bar kinda food and ambiance. Will go back for a casual diner. ,4
" The chicken for one of our meals was a bit under cooked so they gave us a new plate right away and dessert for our whole party of and 10, on the house! ",5
 Great food ,5
" Excellent staff service, wonderful decor, outstanding cuisine!  Menu is truly special. Great downtown location for a meal, or bite to eat, before or after theatre, movie, hockey.  Such an inviting and warm ambiance! ",5
 Little bit irritated that i made reservation and the hostess sat us in the bar. Food was barely lukewarm i hade the tuna which was delicious and my sister had the Pad Thai both were on the verge of being cold. Server was amazing but very busy. ,3
 Great ambience. Food is always a little cold or lukewarm by the time I get it. Waitresses and waiters are always top notch friendly and helpful. Love the shirt slogans. ,4
" Varied menu with enough choice to satisfy all three of us, each with differing tastes, large selection of local beers on tap. Seated in booth on upper floor as bar area on ground floor too noisy. Pleased that there was an elevator between floors.  Early Monday evening not at all crowded, reservation had been made, but obviously not necessary, however still quite noisy even upstairs, with high ceiling and no sound insulation. My idea of a ""medium cooked"" steak was not the same as the chef's, it was too rare in the middle, around the edges was fine but the central piece was too raw to be edible, for me anyway - discovered too late to send it back for further cooking. Attentive, rapid and friendly service, though hidden away in a booth the server (Connor) kept a close eye on us and the bill was presented as soon as we had indicated that the meal was complete, though there was no pressure to vacate the table. A generally pleasant experience, though unremarkable for our first visit to any Jack Astor's Restaurant. ",4
 We had a nice evening here for our anniversary dinner - it was later in the evening but the crowd was very tolerable and the MBA finale game was on. The location is easily accessible from many hotels and situated in the liveliness of downtown Kingston. Food was great and service was kind and checked up on us and very polite. We would recommend this Jack Astor's for a nice meal. ,4
 Fantastic assistance and service to make sure I was happy and served in a timely fashion! Also folks serving seemed happy and enthusiastic! ,4
" We got a patio seat right beside the bar and there were crowds of people trying to get by us all night and it was so irritating. Not good seating, not a good atmosphere. ",1
" The drinks were super slow getting to us. They waited for almost 20 minutes to tell my friend that we out of what she ordered. Then it took another 15- 20 for her second choice in wine to arrive to have be the wrong size. The manager was fantastic, he did what he could to make it right. ",2
" Enjoyed a great meal with my son and my mom during our visit to Kingston.  All personnel were helpful when dealing with my son's food allergies.  Was in communication with the Food Service Manager prior to the visit, and information was clearly communicated to server and to Chef during our visit.  Chef visited our table within the first few minutes to review allergens noted and to reassure us that items of interest were free of allergens noted.  The precautions and protocols in place made me and my son feel very comfortable with restaurant and ordering dinner.  Aside from the attention provided in meal preparation, the meal was delicious!  The server we had was also excellent: friendly and very attentive to our needs.  I'm happy to recommend this restaurant to others...especially to those live with food restrictions and who have trouble finding a place with accommodating and helpful food service professionals.  Kudos to this crew. ",5
" The server was friendly and helpful. I was with a group of six friends. Did not particularly like the long narrow table with the high-backed chairs - we asked to be moved to a booth, and that was fine with the staff. The menu has a big selection; the Summer menu looked interesting to all  - the Sugar Shack chicken fingers were delicious, but next time, I'd ask for a bit more sauce to be applied underneath them.  The washroom situation near the bar is inadequate; ask for the location of the other washrooms when you arrive; no one should be lining up to use a restaurant washroom on a Friday night! Single stall facilities are for your house, not a public place! ",4
" Our visit was very good.  The only thing was that when I reserved online I was mislead to believe that I was reserving a rooftop table.  In the reservation they mentioned patio, and that is the only patio.  We were told on arrival that there were no rooftop reservations, they were able to find us a table on the rooftop, which we really appreciated.  I will not reserve online again for Jack Astors. ",3
 Hi my son picked Jack Asters for his graduation dinner.  Good choice!  Excellent service and good food! Would definitely go again! ,5
 Best Indian food in Kingston!  Delicious every time. ,5
 Loved the setting location by the window. My server was fantastic ! ,5
" I love  eating  at Jack  Astor’s  it's one of mine and my family's  favorite  places  to  eat  at. They have  the most  amazing  pan bread  there  and they make  an outstanding  bruchetta. As for  there entrees  I love there chicken parm  and if I  want  a good  hamburger  it's there holy smoke  burger.  There service  is usually  very friendly  and  they  are  quite  efficient. Great  place  to  eat all around  would  highly  recommend  this  establishment, plus I think  this jack  Astor’s  is the  only  one  that  has roof top  dining, I  can't  wait  to  try  it  now  that  the  nice  weather  is  here. ",5
 When we got there they didn't think they had our reservation which threw me off.  In the special requests on Open Table reservation I mentioned it was for a birthday and would like a song but no one asked or acknowledged that.  Food was good and we had a fun time otherwise. ,4
 Our group sat at high tops on the ground floor. Lovely rooftop patio but weather was not patio weather. Pub food and healthy choices available . Servers were very friendly and efficient. Great sports bar atmosphere but not for quiet conversation. ,4
" Great meal as always, and wonderful service. It was greatly appreciated as well to have the manager personally approach our table. ",5
" We were a group of 5 celebrating 2 birthdays. Service was slower than normal yet courteous. As there was a large table ahead of ours the management team compensated our lunch explaining they want clientele to return and count on quick turn around in the kitchen during the lunch rush. Makes sense to me and thanks to Jack Astors for caring for their clients, especially when it's not expected. ",5
" Three out of the four entrees were good.  The plain burger was just that-plain.  Service was quick, and pleasant.  Family of four, all adults.  We would go again! ",4
" wonderful time, accomondated everything! salmon was fabulous! thank you!! ",5
 We were there for my daughters 30th birthday had a wonderful time good food and fantastic service they even replaced the balloons we had that floated to the ceiling wonderful kind staff thank you for a wonderful evening ,5
" Really enjoy the waitress employees were enjoying themselves makes it a relaxing experience ,thanks see you all soon ",4
 NFL Playoffs ,5
" Love it, Every-time. ",5
 Family dinner before show. Why does it seem like the food portions keep getting smaller at this place. Overall good quality. ,3
 The service was great. However... The atmosphere was loud with terrible acoustics and awful lighting. Couldn't  have a conversation with out pushing your vocal chords. I have 20/20 vision and had a hard time reading the menu so I used my phone flashlight! Food prices in relation to quality and quantity are overpriced. Really overpriced. Being a chef by trade it could be a harsh review but it's my honest opinion.  The menu had a couple of interesting options but definitely limited. ,3
" If the weather is right, the rooftop is a wonderful place to be.  The food was very good and there is a nice variety to choose from.  The mixed bar drink was ho hum, but there are lots of other options.  i would recommend Jack Astor's as a reasonably priced place to go. ",4
" It was my son birthday - the staff was very happy about us coming to celebrate his birthday, great desert served with lights and great signing.  The only set back is that the OpenTable reservation is not valid for the roof terrasse (on the 3rd floor).  Will know this for next time because the terrasse has a great view over old Kingston.  Really enjoyed it - GF menu! ",3
 Little gem if you can be on patio! Good food and best view of Kingston. ,5
 We have been here before in a group and it was ok service considering there must have been 40 adults and kids. This time the service was worse because there were hardly any people dining upstairs and it was slow to get orders taken and food delivered. The only thing we thought could be wrong was that the patio was jammed full and that was clogging things up. The main floor wasn't even that busy.   Anyway we would probably go back if we were in Kingston because we like the menu and it has great options for kids. ,3
" Meal was very over priced ,  when I made the reservation online I said we were celebrating my teenage daughters birthday , I received a call to confirm reservation at that time, they said you are celebrating your  daughters  birthday, I said yes she specifically wanted to go there . A few other customers were celebrating they had a piece of cake brought to them and happy birthday sung by the staff . They never acknowledged it  was her birthday . so many young staff members just hanging around . We had dessert somewhere else . Nachos were the worst I have ever had . there was a salty spice on them as well as a mix of some grated cheddar and the fake nacho cheese sauce . main meal was cold . How hygenic  can it be bringing uncovered  food up three flights , past patrons on the stairs? ",2
 Our server Stefan was very good.  The meals were excellent.  And our small birthday cake/brownie was taasty. ,4
" This was my second and likely last time at this restaurant. The food is bland, poorly prepared and presented and is over priced. The point of going out for dinner is to have something that you likely couldn't make at home yourself and i definitely don't get that at this restaurant. I could make a far better dinner at home. I don't know how this restaurant has survived as long as it has. The only good thing about this restaurant is the roof top patio. ",2
" Staff, including management, were great as always. Our server always kept us hydrated, and serve time for  food and drinks was short, even with a busy patio.   Our business guests from out of town really enjoyed the experience. ",5
 Great view! Good food. Service not the greatest. ,4
 The food is very good and service was courteous but our Naan bread did not come until we had finished our meal. We had the dinner for 2 which was quite complete but a bit pricey. ,4
" 4 star review only because 5 star should be extremely rare. Food was very tasty , the variety we chose was mild to very spicy hot. Service was super friendly proffesional and polite. The staff are not Indian , they are from Bangladesh.  Similar to Indian but not culturally the same , and you can see subtle differences in the food. Well worth the visit. Enjoy! ",4
" Tasty and Fresh Indian cuisine. Attentive service. Clean, modern, comfortable, and spacious. Definitely worth a visit. One of our standby choices in regular rotation. ",4
 We were delighted to spend our 28th wedding anniversary at your restaurant. We ate the meal for two and we were very happy with everything we ate. Thank for the memorable meal. ,5
" Excellent food and service. Great menu, and able to accommodate a large group . ",5
" Ok, but nothing special. Nothing wrong just quite expensive and the food was typical indian ",4
" We had a very nice dinner here. The food was authentic and flavourful. Nice ambiance with friendly, courteous service. We had a great meal for our first visit and returned when we were in Kingston again.  We tried different items for our second visit and were not disappointed. We will definitely eat here again. ",5
" I've been here a few times and it's always good. Service is friendly and prompt. The naan is incredible. Butter chicken, shrimp boohna and saag paneer all delicious. Samosas are really good. Definitely recommend. ",4
 Food was very good particularly the chicken Khorma. ,4
 Absolutely some of the best Indian food we've had anywhere in the world !! If you love/crave authentic Indian food - this is the place. The cauliflower appetizer was over the top. A meal in itself ! ,5
 Best Indian food in Kingston by far ,5
" A friend and I were seated next to the window and enjoyed a quiet, unhurried lunch. The wait staff was professional, unobtrusive, knowledgeable and congenial. My friend and I both had the shrimp curry and it was very good. The presentation was lovely. Flavours of India makes the best naan ever. ",5
" Go here regularly because the food is amazing, the staff are friendly and the service is great. Always a very enjoyable experience! ",5
" Satisfying, tasty, and fresh Indian food and attentive service in a clean, modern space. I guess I would describe Taste of India as a modern take on Indian comfort food. It's a welcome addition to the Kingston restaurant scene, and our regular rotation for a nice dinner out. ",4
 Great food!!! ,5
 This is an exceptional place to eat at an exceptionally reasonable price if you like authentic Indian cuisine. ,5
 I took my husband here for date night.  The food was excellent and the service was fantastic. ,5
" Flavours of India was suggested by a friend who travels to India frequently. The food was great, with distinct flavours in each dish, and the service was also very good, all at a reasonable price. ",5
" Two of us went for dinner on a wet foggy evening. Not many folks in the restaurant but a number of takeout orders were going out. The restaurant is a modern, open space, comfortable, relaxing  and the decor is very well done. Nice space between tables, comfortable seating, cloth table cloths and napkins. We ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, eggplant bhaji and aloo gobi with a little rice, a regular and a garlic naan. Very good flavours and tastes and textures in the three dishes. I had pretty high expectations based on the TA reviews and they did not disappoint. The vegetarian dishes were really VERY good. I could easily forgo the meat in this place although the Tikka Masala was excellent and the naan was used to mop up every bit of sauce. Service was excellent, with both the manager and the waiter discreetly checking to make sure we were enjoying the food. It was hard to choose but i think that my favorite dish was the aloo gobi, potatoes and cauliflower, who'd have thought! Easy on street parking. ",4
" I discovered Flavours of India on-line, a place that received very good reviews, to which it lived up when we arrived.  The service was excellent, the food very good, with decent portions.  Perhaps there could have been a little bit more rice, and the vindaloo was about one level too spicy for this neophyte.  The ambiance was pleasant, with subdued lighting, and an open concept.   The staff even helped find me a string to help rig together my bumper after a fender-bender.  Thank you!  Overall, highly recommended. ",4
" Flavours of India ; first time there ...the food was very good, nice atmosphere...modern but cozy..service was good ...wait time was not long...the restaurant was about half full 700 pm friday night. Prices were not high,  not inexpensive , just reasonable. Best I've had in Kingston. ",4
" We were looking forward to our first experience at Flavours of India. I moved the reservation in the app which was an available time however when we got there they were full and running behind by 3 tables. Standing in the door way was awkward so we ended up leaving and walking down to Darbar, their competition.   Perhaps another time. ",1
 we all had a Madras style curry which was pleasantly spiced. Some people might find it too hot  however it was good for us. The samosas were home made and excellent in fact we took some to go once we were finished. Parking is an issue but on enquirer we found that was parking behind the building. ,5
" Great spot for East Indian cuisine. Modern atmosphere, open space, friendly service. Prices mid-range. ",4
" The food was great, quiet environment and good service! Would recommend ",5
 Friendly staff and good quality. Improvements are ambiance ( to much light) and more vegetables. ,4
 Good food and good service. Nice to see Ontario wine on the menu. ,4
" If you love Indian food this is a great place to go. Portions are generous and the food is delicious.  Pricey but not unreasonable. Clean, modern design. When I am back in Kingston I will definitely go back. ",4
" Very good meal , excellent service.  Warm and cozy ",5
" We went for my bday weekend and stayed at the Inn. Attended daytime wine opening at Glendora where food was also served. It was excellent - roast pork, lovely vegetables and potatoes - along with cheeses and fruit.  The food was so good, we excitedly anticipated our dinner for the evening.  We had reservations.  There were many tables open. We asked to sit by the window and were told by the gentleman seating us that they were set for 4. All tables were set for four we said. He then replied there was a power outage in Watkins Glen so they would be busy. Point is- we were paying guests and made to feel like intruders.  Not a pleasant start. Our waitress was excellent. Friendly. Helped me with my gluten allergy needs. We had read excellent reviews regarding the food but we were not taken to the level we expected with taste or conducive to the cost of the dishes. Presentation was nice - although my side  salad was too big, very large lettuce leaves and too much dressing.  My husbands squash soup was lovely.  I had salmon and he had ox tail. Both were very bland. The carrot purée with the salmon had no flavor. We brought home leftover ox tail and I added some sage and thyme. It definitely helped increase the flavor of the stew. Although we are not big dessert eaters, since it was my birthday we ordered a gluten free one. It was delicious.   We were concerned the wine tastings we had during the day may have impaired our tastes buds - although I was able to add flavor to the stew. We do plan to return and try again.  If we get the same host, I will speak up. His behavior put a negative curve on our experience. We had breakfast there the next morning and he again verbally made a fuss about seating others by the window. Embarrassing and caused undo discomfort. Breakfast, sadly was just as plain tasting. I NEVER use salt at the table but found myself salting my food.  I am truly hoping our next visit finds 5 star worthy food. The Inn and Winery are outstanding. ",4
" It was wonderful. A little chilly in the place but vaulted ceilings will do that. The special touches like the little bite the chef sent out before first course and, the dipping sauces with th rustic bread and the in house made chocolate at the end of the meal. So delicious so appreciated. ",5
 Wonderful meal - fresh local ingredients prepared to perfection ,5
" I had high expectations for this restaurant, however, it fell short.  The menu is too small to have two vegetarian dishes.  The grilled corn soup tasted like a chili base, not corn soup.  The overpriced filet mignon was very small.  The swordfish was overcooked.  We would not go back. ",3
" It was really unfortunate that this highly touted and expensive restaurant was such a disappointment. We ordered small plates because the entrees were so complex with ingredients, with some I’ve never heard of.  We shared 5 small plates and the cheese board for dessert. The time in between service was exceedingly long, because of the lack of sufficient staffing . The empanada was so highly spiced, as to burn my tongue. Also, many entries on the wine list were not a available. Sometimes when you have such a frustrating experience you can laugh it off, well, I’m not laughing ! ",2
" Most of the food was bland, my wife's steak was overcooked, then it took over 20 minutes for it to come back rare ",3
" We ate here for my birthday.  The mussels in curry cream sauce were amazing.  The crab cake had an abundance of crab.  The entrees were wonderful.  My husband's fillet was cooked perfectly and my snapper was wonderful.  Presentation was wonderful.  We had dessert too.  the lemon and the  caramel desserts were yummy.  There were 3 desserts per dish and they were tasty.  It is expensive, but with a bottle of Glenora Brut champagne it was wonderful. ",5
" As always, when in unfamiliar territory, Open Table gives us great options! Veraisons is a perfect example: Was visiting the Finger Lakes in NY for the first time and wanted a good restaurant with a lake view. This restaurant provided both! And excellent meal and a wonderful menu with several very good choices: We chose to share PEI Mussels in a fabulous curry sauce, and then each of us had small plate ""specials"": Wonderful crab cakes and lamb chops. Desserts were very good, but not as exceptional as the rest of the meal. Wine pairings at this winery were excellent! And the view of Lake Geneva was stunning and even included a double rainbow! (Not sure the rainbow is included in every meal…) Service friendly, efficient and helpful! ",5
 We stayed at the Inn at Glenora Wine Cellars and had both dinner and breakfast at   Veraisons.  Ratings above are based on dinner.  Wonderful view of the vineyard and Seneca Lake.  We shared both a cheese board and salad for appetizers.  Both were very good and generous portions.  The cheese board was especially interesting. For main courses we had the duck magret and pasta with lamb ragout. Both were good; portions were relatively smaller than the appetizers.  Service was excellent  Breakfast was good but we were somewhat disappointed by what we ordered (cinnamon bun French toast and cornmeal pancakes).  Eggs might have been a better choice ,4
" We had previously eaten at Veraisons and had a good meal.  This time was disappointing. The food was over cooked and under seasoned.  On the positive side, they do have a variety of gluten and other allergen free items.  The wine list was good with a good selection of local wines.    The restaurant itself is lovely and the view over the lake is spectacular.  The service was outstanding--if only the food had been as good. ",3
 Came up to Seneca Lake for a long weekend and found this place just by googling around. It's a great spot for a little more of an upscale dining experience. We sat outside on the patio which was cold but they had blankets which made it very cozy! We just didn't want to give up the view of the lake! The food was great. Farm to Table style. You need to try the duck carnitas small plate! Mimi was our server and we couldn't have had a more delightful person guiding us through our meal! We would love to go back if we're in the area again. ,5
" Beautiful view of Seneca Lake, lovely outdoor seating, although it was unusually cool and rainy during our meal so we could not take advantage of it. Pretty bar area separate from large dining room. Brightly lit. ",4
 The staff is friendly and attentive and the view is stunning and what separates it from most places . Definitely would recommend. ,5
 A very nice vineyard/hotel venue. Very good food and wine. Seated on porch that was very nice ambiance. Server was very nice but service was extremely slow. Waited 15+ minutes for dessert. ,3
" Glad to see a variety of gf options. Focaccia bread was stale but my gf rolls were delicious! Two orders of filet mignon were ok and the two orders of the gf lamb parpadelle were just ok, very bland. ",4
 Anniversary ,5
 We had a great dinner on the porch overlooking the lake. Service was excellent--we are vegetarian and the server made sure we could eat butter before bringing the bread. The views were lovely and the food was good. The only criticism is that the kids' flatbread was made with a strong cheese that wasn't quite kid friendly. Everything else was very good. ,5
" Great food, super service and a breathtaking view of Seneca Lake. A must for anyone who wants a wonderful and romantic dinner in the Finger Lakes. ",5
 Great outdoor dining &amp; view. Food was good ,3
" Without a reservation we were able to get a seat even though they were very busy.  They sat us at a beautiful table on their patio overlooking Lake Seneca.  The menu identifies things like GF-Gluten Free, DF-Dairy Free, etc. This to a person with allergies is great news. It also indicates that you have a professional chef on site. The rest of the staff is in tune with different types of restrictions as well.   We returned several times during our stay in the Finger Lakes.  They have a very well thought out menu.  Prices were reasonable. Service by Evan, Lacy and Sabrina were excellent. ",5
" We loved everything about the restaurant. The ambience, food, wine and view were excellent. We will definitely return if we go back to Seneca lake ",5
" The setting was absolutely gorgeous, overlooking the vineyards.  The food was excellent, but on the pricey side. You do have to allow a couple of hours for a leisurely dinner, since the service is slow, but the beautiful setting is worth it. A must when visiting the Finger Lakes. ",5
 We had a wonderful time. Great food and wine. Lots/plenty of house-made items from scratch. ,5
 Wine and food were just Ok and over priced for what we received. We seated in the downstairs auxiliary seating area as the main dining area was closed for a wedding reception. Thus ruining the view of Lake Seneca and the vineyards. Probably would not return. ,3
 Fabulous meal.  Fabulous service.  We had a vegan in our group and the waitress and kitchen made the entire experience a pleasure.  Can't wait to return. ,5
" We were thrilled that we were able to be seated on a Friday evening on the deck, even though we had just changed our reservation (from Saturday when we were informed there was a wedding to Friday). Thus we enjoyed a beautiful view with a good meal on the whole, but with some variability between our choices. The mussel appetizer with the curry broth was good to the last drop! The grilled corn soup though tasty was rather a strange color? The bulgogi lettuce cups were also delicious, but it was a shame there was so little beef and far too many lettuce leaves. We would recommend the charcuterie and local artisanal cheese boards, however. Everyone at the table wanted to try our fellow diner's lamb ragu over papadelle noodle-it tasted like our Italian grandmother had made it. The salmon and tuna special entrees were just average. The duck entree with cherry sauce however, melted in your mouth! Everyone enjoyed a spoonful of the lemon plate desserts. Although the servers were friendly, they were often absent and seemed a little inexperienced-we were without a spoon, a knife or a fork at various times and for some time. They also chose to reach across the diners to clear plates, even though there was plenty of space to move around us. Overall, the evening was a hit confirmed by several other parties celebrating different events. ",4
" Our meal was excellent!  In fact, we were guests at the Inn and decided that there was no need to drive around looking for a better dining experience. so we had dinner there the second night too. Again the food and service were wonderful! ",5
" We wanted to sit out on the veranda but all the tables were taken, however  it only took them a few minutes to set a table for us. The view of Lake Seneca and the vineyard was bucolic.  Had the cheese board which was magnificent with local cheeses, sweet grapes and good bread.  The butter was super creamy, couldn't get enough of it.  Had the salmon, the pappardelle with braised  lamb, and the chicken--all delicious. The portions are large so be warned --not for the petite of appetite but you would have great leftovers to enjoy later with the wines of Glenora.  Enjoyed the Glenora Brut and the Pinot blanc. The rose was very drinkable. The Cabernet Sauvignon was somewhat flabby, not much body or structure to it, so sad to say it disappointed. ",5
 I requested their best table for my wife's birthday.  A wedding party had reserved the main dining area so we were seating in their wine cellar.  The food was good however some of the service lacking.  I noticed we didn't get a bread basket prior to our meal as the surrounding tables.  I had to ask for it after our meal was delivered.  It would have been nice to have the bread with our wine prior to our entrees being served. ,4
 I went with the $45 Steak special. Asked for it Medium and it came out extremely Well-Done.  The potatatoes that came with it had the consistency of sand. ,3
 The mussels are amazing and the wines are wonderful! ,4
 Birthday dinner out in the deck.. great view to match always great dishes and wine. Never a bad night here!! ,5
" One of the nicest restaurants on Seneca. The food is relatively inventive for the area and well prepared. Nice array of options for all.  Views to die for over the lake...if you get the right table. There was a wedding when we went and the top floor was unavailable (the better vistas), so we went to the bottoms level which lacked any ambiance for a restaurant of this caliber. This floor has limited lake views also.  The restaurant would really benefit from more outdoor seating facing the lake (there is some on the front patio facing the road). Feels like a missed opportunity for them and/or a more casual sister restaurant (a growing trend in the business).  Bottom line: they delivered on expectations and it was a nice evening. I'll likely be back too. There's just so much more opportunity to make things better. ",4
 We waited 20 mins to be acknowledged by our waitress.  It was not busy.  The food was okay but not worth the price.  The winery was a much better experience than the restaurant at Glenora. ,2
" We were here for a birthday vacation. I made these reservations based on the reviews. However we were moved to the lower level because there was a wedding. They called it the wine cellar but it felt more like an office space. The server didn't tell us the specials. I had to ask and I only did because I heard the server behind us telling his table. I ordered split pea soup which was basically beef broth with peas. I also ordered the pappardelle with braised rabbit, which was horrible. There was no flavor. I had to ask for salt and pepper. I couldn't even eat a full bite. It clearly looked like it was sitting under the heat lamp too long. The pork belly buns were mediocre at best. We were there for two hours because the service was so slow and it was only the two of us. One couple came in after us and were finished their meals before we even got ours. For the price we paid and the quality of the food, I would not recommend this to anyone. There are way better options. ",1
 The cheese plate was excellent including the crackers.  The desserts were well thought out and amazing.  There was a beautiful view of the lake at sunset.  This is one of the few upscale restaurants in the area. ,5
 We stayed at the Inn so it was nice to eat right there in the restaurant. Friday night fish fry was very good. ,3
" Fish tacos were dry and smelled fishy. Not enough beyond fish to make this palatable. The dessert was pretentious and overpriced at $12. Something with a roasted beet, a poor red velvet cake and some other things that added nothing. The cream cheese ice cream was the only decent thing in this dessert. A simpler creation would work so much better. ",3
" We ate here twice during our stay. Our waiter, Kyle, was the best.  We tried both the cheese and charcuterie board, soup and salad as well as 4 entrees.  All were well prepared/presented.  Squash soup was outstanding, salad OK.  Salmon, pork chop, chicken and duck were all flavorful and creative.  Extensive wine list with the majority Glenora or sister wineries.  The dining room presentation was great as was the pacing of the delivery of the food.  Full bar was available.  Good coffee for after dinner. ",5
 We had a blast!! The music was wondeful!  The food was good.  Definitely going again. ,5
 We enjoyed everything from the band to the food. Nice spot for entertaining guest ... ,5
" Waitress was fantastic, however, hostess was rather rude; she refused to seat us until one person in our party (who was running 5 minutes behind) arrived.  Once our final party member arrived/we were all there, she told us to wait until she seated two separate parties who did not have reservations. ",4
 Music was great and so was the ambiance. Fried chicken and waffles were very good. The peach cobbler was awesome. Friend had shrimp and grits and said they were great. ,5
" They wouldn't seat us until our entire party was there which sucked, especially since it's was kind of empty! Our server was great! Food was pretty good and bottomless mimosas!!! The live music was kind of loud but we still had a great time!   We went for Sunday brunch around 1pm and it wasn't packed at all!! Prepare to pay for parking ($10) ",4
" Fun atmosphere, great food. Get your talking in before the music starts because once it does you won't hear each other, which is ok, the music was worth giving your full attention to. ",5
" We love Sweet Georgia's Juke Joint!  We eat there every time we are in Atlanta for business.  In fact, last week we ate their 3 times in one week!  All of the servers are fantastic and the live music is always great! ",5
" What a hoot! Loved Rachael the server, a warm wonderful person! Great food great energy. Loved it. ",5
 We received great service here...from the hostess to the waitress.  The food was excellent.  Live music - jazz was very pleasant and not too loud . ,5
 Hubby birthday enjoyed good and live band.which I was happy to find on a Tuesday night ,4
 We loved it! Didn't know about he entertainment fee but it was well worth it. ,5
" Good food and environment. Love the entertainment David Scott, one man band was amazing! ",5
 Server and Band ,4
" The food is overpriced and we have a waiter that was rushing us so they could prepare the table for other customers. If this establishment is going to charge an entertainment fee for each dining patron, then they should understand that customers will want to stay and listen to the band for a couple of hours. Being told that I have 30 minutes after eating is rude when we had only been there for about 45 minutes. ",3
 Visited Atlanta and heard about Sweet Georgia's Juke Joint. We had an absolute blast! I would definitely recommend this restaurant. ,5
" The Jazz and the atmosphere was really good. The food was was typical Southern fried chicken macaroni and cheese, collard greens, and cornbread Delicious. However for a party of two; it was overpriced. Jazz artist Dave Scott was great! Kudos on the Juke Joint lemonade blackberry and strawberry fermented to perfection. Appetizer fried green tomato need a little work, prepared in the wrong batter. ",5
" Food was marginal, some dinners came out cold &amp; generally not good.  Oddly enough they had an automatic $5 pp entertainment fee added to the check.  Ok I get it - music was ok a bit too loud but they started playing as we were finishing dinner.  So we heard sitting on the dock of the bay &amp; happy birthday to someone in the restaurant...2 songs at a low price of $5 pp.    Don't waste your evening or money ",3
" We came for hubby's birthday. His first time there.  He said it was ""cool!"" Which n means he really liked it and he wants to go back! !! I always enjoy when I'm there! !!! ",5
 Went for Sunday brunch to celebrate boyfriend's birthday. Music and live band was awesome. They included the audience in their dialogue and gave shout outs to people celebrating anything. Food was delicious and so flavorful. There was not one thing we had that was bad.  He really enjoyed everything which made it more special. The waitress brought him out a peach cobbler with a candle at the end too! We are still talking about that macaroni and cheese.   Mmmmm. We can't wait to go back. ,5
" My girlfriends and I had a blast. We were gathering for a birthday and decided to do Sunday brunch. We all enjoyed the food, jazz, and overall ambience. I would definitely recommend it to a friend. ",5
" This place was so much fun - the entertainment was GREAT, the service was GREAT, the drinks were GREAT, and the food was, you guessed it, GREAT!!!  Although it is a Juke Joint, pay attention to the hours, as it does close earlier than one might assume... ",5
 Awesome Experience! ,5
 Great meal. Ambiance was lovely. Everything tastes good from appetizers to dessert ,5
" Food was ok, nothing great, but reasonably priced. Enjoyed the live music. ",4
 GrEat date place or just get together with friends.  Food always on point. Chicken n Waffles are alllllllll that! ,5
" Had a really nice, relaxed, grown folk time and dinner here on Nov27, our 34th wedding anniversary! Will be back! ",4
 Awesome experience.  I went for my birthday and planning to go again soon. ,5
" Very great place. Great experience. My only complaint was it took a while for our server to show up, and then a little longer than expected for our drinks to come. Our server Brandy more than made up for it though. The entertainment was awesome, food was even better! We will be back! ",4
 First time attending will become one of my lifetime favorites.  Ordered appetizers and drinks while enjoying live music performed by Punkin Pluto and she was awesome. ,5
 Came here with my brother his GF and kids.  Loved the music.  Loud but awesome band.  They don't tell you about the $5 pp entertainment charge but I saw it in a review.    Food was good.  Fried chicken pulled pork all very tasty.    Service slow but very nice.    Overall not knock your socks off but a decent experience. ,3
" Just about every food item that came out was like warm at best. Several items I wanted from the menu weren't available. Mind you this was a slow Tuesday evening. The taste of the food was okay but soul food shouldn't come at the cost of $20/plate if it just going to be okay. Tourist area, tourist prices, I won't be fooled again. ",3
 This was our first visit to Sweet Georgia's and we loved it! My boyfriend and I love live music and love southern comfort food so this spot was perfect. Food was delicious and he ambiance as nice. Prices are reasonable for portions and quality of the food. Parking was easy and nearby. This will be one of our go to spot every time we visit Atlanta! ,5
" Great night with great music, great energy and great food! ",5
 Great restaurant really enjoyed the live band and friendly atmosphere ,5
 The best fried chicken ever! ,5
" A little clumsy seating procedure; finally got a seat near the music. Average soul food (pork chop and shrimp and grits. Band was ""ok"" stayed 1 set. Very short walk to the Westin a plus. Just short of 4 stars. Would give it another chance, Wed night may have been an ""off"" night. ",3
 My second visit here and it was great!  Brought family vising from out of town. ,5
" We had a reservation on Open Table, worked perfectly.  Ordered the salmon, chicken and ribs. Food selections were great, fresh, homemade sides (cheesy grits yum), then deserts of peach cobbler and bread pudding. Just the best! ",5
 Very friendly place to eat &amp; listen to good music. ,5
" The food was great,  the ambience and music were outstanding. ",4
" food was great as always. as for making reservations, the wait time for my party was the same both times with the first time a walk in reservation and the second time a month in advance on line. there was no urgency from the hostesses in seating us. ",5
" It was awesome, the band was great!! ",4
 Wow!! what a great place to eat and spend time with friends/family. Food was superb (especially crab cakes stuffed with shrimp.)Clean atmosphere. Beautiful restaurant. Hostess and waiters professional and accommodating for large crowds. Went on a Friday night Toni Byrd and Band performed they blew the roof off!!!...I plan to go back real soon!! ,5
" Go for the music!! Food is just OK, but the live music and ambiance totally makes up for it. Highly recommend for a fun evening out with your date or a group when you want to take in some good jazz blues. ",4
" The food here is typically good. I have been there 3x and had the shrimp and grits twice. It is really delicious, but has lots of butter. The portion this time appeared to be smaller, with only 5 shrimp, and a little dollop of grits. The chicken is always phenomanal, the fried green tomatoes are quite good. I find the drinks a little pricey, and a little too strong, a little over the top. You'd better travel with your Designated driver. Overall it is a very good dining experience, they will validate your parking ticket which is quite a nice touch, staff is friendly and attentive. I will return again. I enjoyed the music as well as the meal! ",4
 I can never get enough of this place. It is wonderful. I love the energy and the live music. The food was heavenly and the service was outstanding! ,5
 YaYa Sisterhood really enjoyed ourselves. The band that night was so good and the food was on point. I will make sure to tell all my friends out and in town this a for sure spot to check out!!! ,5
 Went for girlfriend's birthday and had a great time. This was my second time going while in the Atlanta area...I went back in the Fall and the place was packed. It was a nice crowd but know where near my last visit. The drinks were on point! Would definitely go back when in the area. ,4
 Music great! Mixed crowd of all ages. ,4
" My date and I made reservations 5 before we went to Sweet Georgia's Juke Joint. The main reason we wanted to go is because one of my favorite local bands, Gritz and Jelly Butter gigs there regularly. We arrived and ended up waiting an hour past our reservation time. Another couple that was waiting told us they had been there just past an hour. While we waited, we witnessed several groups of people walk in after us and get sat right away. The hostess was very apologetic, but the fact remained that we had been skipped in our wait for someone who was obviously more important than us. Otherwise, the place was good. The manager Daryl came over and comped us on drinks and a desert. They really need to work on organizing the reservations better. ",3
 Our reservation was for 9pm but we weren't seated until 10pm and only after complaining because later arrivals that were regulars appeared to be seated first regardless of reservation time. They were extremely overbooked and did not seem sure how to get things back on track. The food however was excellent and the manager (Gerald) did everything to attempt to make it a pleasant dining experience. ,2
" The food was just ""average."" Each of us ordered something different, so I had taste samples of the brisket, ribs, pork chop, and I had ordered the fried chicken. The drinks were great and so was the peach cobbler with vanilla ice cream ",4
" Our first time there, as a couples outting. I've raved about this spot every since. I will return again and again. ",4
 I had fun and its a nice date place or go and chill with your girls place. The service was excellent and everyone there made sure you were ok and all your needs were met. The food and drinks were top notch and cant wait to go again. It's gets packed so its best to make reservations ,5
 For my first experience it was kind of rough. Eventhough we had reservations for 9:15 we didn't get seated until about 10. I know that is beyond control because from what I saw everyone with large parties did not do what they were suppose to do and have all of their people there on time so in many cases others (smaller groups) had to suffer. Once we were seated there were some minor issues but once the music started nothing else mattered and we just partied the night away and had a blast! ,3
" Went there for my birthday with my wife, and glad we made reservations first off. Second, the food was very good, but the band was outstanding!!! Toni Byrd, and we came on a night that had a special guest, He was awesome as well. Already recommended this great place to our friends. Will be back soon. ",5
" Excellent entertainment on Friday; some menu items are EXCELLENT, some should be dropped; could probably support larger space, but have only been there once; time limit to sit at table should be clear. ",4
" Nice ambiance and music. Food is mediocre and was served at room temperature. Nice place to hang and get drinks, but not the best place to satisfy your food appetite. ",3
" Not very customer-service oriented, AT ALL! ",1
 The energy in the building was awesome!!!! The food to me wasnt great my chicken was very dry and needless to say I only ate Peach Cobbler for dinner.....My reservation was at 8:30 but my party of 15 had to stand for an hour to be seated.....Due to the time in which we had to wait to be seated.....Everyone in my party was given a FREE shot and they did apologize for the wait.......The band was GREAT!!!! N Da Groove was the band that performed on the night we had dinner....I would recommend this place for dinner but if you want to hear good music and have dessert and drinks this would be a great place to visit..... ,2
" Thanks for fulfilling my request to sit right in the front. :) Drinks could have been a litle bit bigger but hey, this is Atlanta right. Good taste though. ",5
" I loved the atmosphere, the ambience was great. The shrimp and grits dish was amazing. The house salad was superb. Music was on point. Great date night. ",2
" My wife and I dined at Sweet Georgia'a Juke Joint for her 32nd birthday and we really had a good time. We were looking for a place that was classy, with good live music and good food and we found it. Outside of being a little crowded, our experience was most pleasant. ",5
" Loved the live bands! Our reservation was for 8:45 PM. We were privy to different bands performances. The waiter forgot to put our order in. He was gracious enough to advise us of this. The manager discounted our meal because of this and put a rush on our order. My sweet potato fries were cold. The rest of the food was good. The waiter surprised us with free deserts, because of the mix up of our order. We will go back. ",5
 The 911 Band was great! Went there for my birthday and had a great time. ,5
 My friends and I really enjoyed ourselves. My only disappointment was the party next to me got extremely large which took over our space. Overall it was great and I love the band...911!!!! ,3
 I really enjoyed the live band. ,5
" No reservation was requested before 5pm, able to seat yourself. Server was very nice. ",3
" This was a very pleasant and enjoyable dining experience. The food, the service, and the Willie Hill band was great! ",5
 Overall the experience was very good. There was one incident in which the server brought us our bill before we had even ask for it. We were not through ordering so he had to take the bill back and revise it. ,4
 We had an excellent time at the Juke Joint. Every aspect of our visit was outstanding from the food to the wait service to the live music. ,5
 The wait for a table even with reservations was extremely long. ,3
 Wonderful supper club type joint. excellent performers. ,5
" Great food, great music - had a ball on a girl's night out! We decided to try something new and this turned out to be a great choice. The service was great from the valet to the coat check (free) to the server. We will definitely be back!! ",5
" Brought my husband here for his pre-birthday celebration. I really enjoyed the music and the ambiance. The food was another issue. Our entrees were FANTASTIC! I had the salmon and my husband had the fried chicken. We had a sampler platter for an appetizer that included fried green tomatoes, fried okra and onion rings. I think there were 5 shaved onion rings on the entire plate and the fried green tomatoes were greasy and tasteless. As I indicated, the entrees were wonderful but the vegetable sides...not good at all. We had the cabbage and the spinach. Both require some form of seasoning but had none. The Mac and cheese was ok. We will return again and hopefully we will figure out the food selections that will make our meal great. ",4
" Sweet Georgia's Juke Joint is amazing! I had the crawfish bruschetta appetizer, along with fried chicken, sweet potato fries, and mac &amp; cheese. All were AMAZING. The holiday jazz show with Toni and the Walk Ups was fabulous. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE! ",5
" This was my second visit and it was as enjoyable as the first. The food was good and the service was excellent. When you go ask for Logan to be your server. The managers/owners took the time to make sure that we were happy with with everything. The band was good and the atmosphere created allowed you to interact with them and each other. By the end of the evening it was like one big party of new found friends. It was a great place to celebrate my birthday. Though the attire lends itself to more than casual - the ambiance is one of just hanging out having a good time. I would definitely recommend it. Being from Mississippi, it was nice to hear some blues. ",5
 The mood was perfect. Great jazz band. The hostess was the mostest. She really gave our party superb attention. We will definitely return. The food was tasty and reasonably priced. ,5
" The food was great, but the service was mediocre. Our appetizer came before our beverages, and we had to remind the waiter that we asked for water. We were also not informed of the $5 (per person) entertainment charge that would be added to our bill. While the live entertainment was great, it was also too loud. This is no place to catch up with old friends or have an intimate conversation. ",2
" The host was outstanding. Our waiter was nice, but not very attentive. We were seated for 15 minutes before our orders were taken and then we waited an additional 40 minutes before our food was served. One meal was inaccurate, although we ordered exactly as it was on the menu. 2 in our party of 8 had to remind him that we were still awaiting a side dish. The retsaurant was not very crowded but the wait for food was unacceptable. We traveled from Cobb Co. for lunch during the business day and found the service completely unacceptble. This was not my first visit as I've dined there on a Sat. evening with 3 friends for dinner and the experience was similar. Sadly, it is unlikely that I will return or recommend this place to others. ",2
" This our first visit to the downtown location. The atmosphere was great. The pianist came by and chatted. The service was fantastic. Our server, Rachel, was very friendly and attentive.  The food was incredible. Southern has never been jazzed up so well. ",5
 I loved the live music and food! Troupe Trio-Regina was AMAZING! The grilled pork chop entree (real juicy) and shrimp/crab cakes were delicious! You get a lot of food! The peach moonshine punch was perfect for me....sweet and not too strong! The server brought out a peach cobbler with a lit candle for my love's birthday. ,5
 The entertainer for the evening was AWESOME.....I really wish the patrons would have given her a little more love....but I LOVE the resturant.... that cool vibe there....really nice ,4
" Great food-fast, helpful service- live fantastic music- reasonably priced ",5
 Great dining experience.  Ambience was great. Server was great--Rodricus!! ,5
" Great Southern food, excellent service and talented musicians.  What's not to like.. ",5
" Love it. We really enjoyed the food, live music &amp; dancing ",5
 Enjoyed the live jazz band. Food was good and portion was large (I had the fried chicken with greens and mac and cheese).  Waitress was friendly however hostess could have been more friendly. Overall enjoyable evening and would return when in the Atlanta area. ,4
" This place was very nice. The live jazz music was a great compliment to the great food. Loved the mac-and-cheese, some of the best I've had in a restaurant and I've eaten plenty. If you are looking for a nice environment and some good food and live music this is the place. ",5
" Great location, wonderful  service and we loved the entertainment . ",5
 Server was amazing. Very sweet and knowledgable. Great southern food! ,5
" Service slow, food very average, didn't realize this was a music place, much too loud for conversation. This is a tourist trap. ",2
" I did understand that there would be live music, but to be charged $5 per person and the 2 person live band was on break during our entire visit. The restaurant did show video of Seal's live in concert. They could have skipped the band and show big screens. As far as the food, I ordered the waffle and chicken wings which unfortunately not hot when brought to the table. My boyfriend ordered shrimp and grits which was not the best. He said the shrimp was good, but the grits a big disappointment. I could see what he meant, very runny, almost watery.  Although it was not very busy, the service was slow. The waitress was good, but not her fault about the meal. I would like to think we hit on an off day maybe, but  we don't plan to return to find out. ",3
" Great menu! Lots of Southern faorites. Jazz trio was very good, ",5
" solid southern food, flavorful without being greasy. great drinks. on the pricey side but not unreasonable for what they offer. great live music, but not a first date destination! ",4
 Great choice for any occassion. Food was excellent. Entertainment full of old school classics was awesome. Will recommend to all my friends visiting the ATL from Tampa. ,5
 The food was great and the band and the singer are awesome. Worth the $5 entertainment charge. The drinks are a little overpriced. ,5
" I didn't care too much for the cheeseburger and peach glazed salmon. Both dishes didn't have any flavor or good seasoning. Therefore, I was a bit disappointed in the food. The fried chicken wings were pretty good and I loved the ranch dressing. ",4
" Overall ok. Great food. Emtertainment good. Would have like a heads up on automatic entertainment fee charged at end on the bill for each person. Also, it would have also been good to know about the table time limit instead of being pressured by management through our waitress to leave when first of all there were other tables available and secondly we had paid for entertainment that we couldn't enjoy after being watched and stood over by management. I would recommend to a friend only because it's a historic place, food and entertainment good but with a note about the hidden fees and table time limit. ",3
 Sweet Georgia's is a great spot for live music with a good bar at the end of any day in downtown Atlanta ,4
" If you are in Atlanta, you will really miss a fine experience.  You owe it to yourself. ",5
 Food was great. Band was excellent.  Between the band/video it can be loud. it was great for a girls night out. Just don't expect to hold a conversation it will be too loud. ,4
 Enjoyed the atmosphere! Our waitress was really goodI! ,5
" Food is just okay...very average.  It's a touristy spot in my opinion and not worth making a special trip. The band was really good, though. They automatically add an 'entertainment fee' to the bill which seemed silly to me since 'juke joint' is  kinda the theme of the restaurant. ",2
" My daughter made reservations for 9 people at 8pm. We all arrived by 7:48 but was not seated until 8:30. Myself nor my  guest realize the restaurant closed at 10 pm. They came far to celebrate with me for 1 1/2 hrs. We were rush out by our waitress, her service was poor and she never gave us desert menus. One sad birthday :( ",1
" I was in Atlanta for a business trip and was looking for a place to get dinner.  Excellent place with great service, food and live music.  I will happily come back my next time in town. ",5
 Great drinks ,4
" Many folks come here for the music, which is live and usually good.  I come for the food and have never been disappointed.  Like gumbo, try theirs, and don't forget the main part of the meal - dessert!  Yum! ",4
 Best food in the south!! This place is worth a visit every time. Elevated soul food at its best.   I won't come to Atlanta without visiting again ,5
" We had dinner here and loved it. entertainment was great, and the food was fantastic. The  peach cobbler and banana pudding were incredible! ",5
 Great overall experience. Out of town guests want to visit again because of the entertainment ,4
" Enjoyed this spot with the hubby on Sunday. Hostess was a little spacey but tolerable. Ordered bottomless mimosas BUT, our waitress was too slow on the meaning of Bottomless. Not a deal breaker since the food was good and tasty. We'll go back again for sure. ",4
 menu  needs more. entermantment charge is a rip off  .This is why I skip this restaurant at times ,3
 Best peach cobbler ever!  Food is southern and very good.  Music is great. ,4
 This restaurant was not prepared to handle a huge event/convention. ,3
 Great food and equally great service ,5
" Our server was OUTSTANDING!!  Unfortunately I can't remember his name, only that he was a young African-American male.  He certainly has the temperament and personality for customer service.   The fried chicken and peach cobbler did not disappoint.  Your front desk personnel were very pleasant and helpful when part of my party arrived late.  I enjoyed the jazz combo.  The restaurant was a bit too crowded and noisy for me and distracted from the ambiance.  When I visit Atlanta in the future, I would probably try to visit your restaurant again at less crowded, less noisy time. ",3
 Great service! ,5
" Sweet Georgia's Juke Joint is a must stop while in Atlanta.  Great food, atmosphere and music. ",4
 AWESOME time. Music was great and so was the peach cobbler!! ,5
" The live band was amazing! We went on a Thursday and we had amazing service although I with the online menu was up to date I had my heart set on those short ribs. I settled for the fried chicken instead which was still amazing. Great time, great vibes, and good laughs. Had so much fun I forgot my servers name but he was amazing as well. The peach cobbler... was so good I was dancing in my seat. Will definitely be back! ",4
 Service was terrible. Our waitress was very slow and then non-existent. We later found out she had to leave and someone had taken over our table. We weren't informed and thought she was just helping out. ,3
 This is my second time coming here and each time I had  an excellent time... The food and the band there Thursday night was truly amazing 😉. ,5
" Interesting drink menu and I enjoyed some of the monshine drinks.  Food was okay--not great.  Pulled pork was dry but the shrimp and grits was tasty and a large serving.   Our server was attentive.  Music was enjoyable.  Would have stayed longer, but had another place to go to. ",4
 Great time only thing is table for 2 is very small and tight you dont have room for drinks and food almost knocked over 😂 ,5
 Went here for Southern food as we were attending a conference.  Great choice ....  Food was great and the service was excellent.  Also had a band there that was also very good.  Would recommend again. ,5
" If you are looking at the name of this place and thinking ""That looks like a good place to try"" then you should definitely  go!  The music is great.  The food is better.  When we went the band started at 7:00pm, go get an earlier reservation if you want to talk some.  But after that, be ready for good soul/R&amp;B music and authentic southern specialties.  Great night.  Can't wait to go back! ",5
" Went to brunch with family. Service was amazing and we had no wait for seating at the bar. This was my 2nd time and the food wasn’t quite as good as it was the first time (a little cold, not lacking in flavor), but still a great experience! ",5
 We had a great timr ,5
" Had a wonderful time! Would definitely recommend, especially for special occasions. ",4
 It was my aunt’s 60th bday. I have another aunt  who has a bday a couple days prior. They are from a time where their mother owned a light club that sold food and had juice entertainment so i wanted them to experience that once again. Our experience was awesome and we laughed the entire time! ,3
" This was my 3rd time dining at Sweet Georgia's Juke Joint, like they ALWAYS do...They delivered.  It was my Grandmother' 85th birthday and there was NO other place I would have taken her.  I hope to take her for her 86th birthday.  My family loved the food and the trio that played that evening was ON POINT.  What a GREAT night!!! ",5
" My first-time visit was a good experience. There's live music which has $5 fee per guest, plus additional costs in parking with an average of $20 for the entree and drink. The chicken and waffles seemed to be ordered the most, in which I also ordered. It seems to be a nice hangout spot for the entire family during lunch, but I'm sure it's gets really ""grown and sexy"" at night. Be sure to make your reservation with open table to ensure it won't be too long of a wait! ",4
" This was a first visit for the 5 of us. Over all the brunch food was tasty but not over the top, with some items overcooked (eggs in the crab Benedict and omelets). The parmesan grits were a hit and so were the deviled eggs appetizer.  We did want to both enjoy the music and visit with one another but found it hard to talk at all when the singer's performance was underway (loud). If there were a way to tone the vocalist's volume just a bit it would be more enjoyable over all (we were sitting at the seats furtherest from the stage). The music was fun and enjoyable. When the singer took breaks and the musicians played, some of the time it was very pleasant and not so loud as to be overwhelming. ",4
 Great server!!! ,5
" Great atmosphere, loved the live music  Service great, food pretty good. I'd  like to come back for the Sunday brunch ",5
 Here for the trade show. Great music and service after a long day. ,5
 The food was cold and mediocre at best..wasn't worth the 30.00 I spent at all. I sent the appetizer back because it was cold and it came back cold again. I probably want go back. ,2
 The restaurant is conveniently located and easily visible from Peachtree St. The hostess was a little cold and short when we first entered the restaurant but improved as we talked to her more. This can also be said for our waitress who turned out to be awesome. I felt that we had to joke with them and convince them that it was okay to be nice and provide good customer service. The food was well seasoned and you received large portions which were both positives. ,4
 The second band (The Trio) was quite a hit!! ,5
 We sat at the bar on a Sunday for brunch and football. The service was excellent. The bartenders were very attentive to our needs.  The food was fine. I had shrimp with grits and my husband had an omelet.The endless mimosas were great. We just wish we knew in Georgia you  can not serve alcohol before noon. ,4
" It was fun, entertaining, the food was delicious, the service was amazing. All around great experience. ",5
 This was my 4th visit since last year and the service was just ok. The food wasn't as good as I remembered either. I was disappointed. ,3
 The live music was excellent! I enjoyed everything about the place!⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ ,5
 It was great! Good service! Great food! And good endless mimosas! ,5
" Sweet Georgia's Juke Joint was a blast. The entertainment was excellent, and certainly worth the cover charge.    the Bloody Mary was excellent, and the fried chicken was delicious. One of my friends said she typically never eats the skin of the chicken, but this was a rare exception!  We went for Sunday brunch. The customers were there for a good time, and a good time was had by all.   I  found the staff to be very nice, not necessarily experienced. But their willingness to serve superseded their experience. My recommendation to tourists or first time visitors is to remember this is a Juke Joint not a 5 Star restaurant. Once  you remember that, all is well! We found the price to be very reasonable. ",4
 Bad all the way around ,1
" This place offers authentic reasonably priced southern cooking accompanied by danceable blues music with an easy-going vibe. The music limits conversation but the band takes breaks, and the place has personality. ",4
" We all enjoyed our food, and our server, Eddie, was very accommodating and attentive. The music was on point for festive ambiance. ",5
 Great fun night with real Atlanta southern cooking  Love the band ,5
" friendly service, good food, great music and good value ",4
" Every time I come to Atlanta I make it a point to visit. Great food, awesome live music. You can’t miss! ",5
" Great atmosphere, waitress was very  polite . The food and drinks was awesome, I really enjoyed the entertainment. ",5
 I loved every bit of the experience and atmosphere ,5
 The live music was the perfect complement to the good food. ,4
 The waiter forgot our appetizers which made our wait longer for food. The greens were not hot and the mac and cheese was very dry. Our reservation was for 7:15 however the food should be served hot. ,3
 Good food and great atmosphere. Overall wonderful time with the family ,5
 They charge an “Entertainment fee” of $5 per person. Food was decent but service was absolutely horrible. ,2
" Great food, great service, great atmosphere.  A friend came in town and stayed at the Ritz.  I didn't realize it was across the street when I made the reservation.  Highly recommend!!! ",5
" Fun atmosphere with live music and southern classics like fried green tomatoes and shrimp and grits.  While we were there a spontaneous conga line broke out and pretty much everyone in the restaurant joined in! There were lots of groups celebrating birthdays too.  It is noisy but fun.  The food was good, although it was heavy fare.  The waitstaff was friendly, service was pretty slow.  We went for a fun night out with entertainment and good food and we enjoyed ourselves. ",4
 This was our first time here and the experience was great!!! The food was delicious and the service was excellent. My husband and I were celebrating our 3rd wedding anniversary. We can't wait to go back! ,5
" I truly enjoyed the ambiance at this restaurant. The food was pretty good. I had the Salmon while not the best I ever had, it was pretty tasty. I also had the Pleasure of trying the sweet potato cheesecake..Delicious would be an understatement. It was so good, I had to buy an additional one to take home. Will definitely be back ",4
" They have a terrible brunch menu all to choose from is breakfast food and that was only 6 choices. There dinner menu doesnt start until 4. This is a nice spot to have a meal and listen to the live band, just not till after 4. ",1
 Sweet Georgia Juke Joint is very elegant and relaxing at the same time. The waiters and waitresses are very pleasant. The live Jazz is what create the ambiance for the place. ,4
" The service was slow, but the food was very good. The trio that played took to many breaks, however when they did place it was very good. Thanks for the valet service was great for families, singles and older people. ",4
 The restaurant is decorated very nicely although the tables were rather close together. Our waiter was a bit scatterbrained and forgot to bring out parts of our meal. Actually he was rather slow in general. So we had to call on other people to assist but they quickly responded and got us what we needed. ,3
" This is an awesome venue for a date. My husband and I celebrated our 6 month Anniversary last night at Sweet Georgia Juke Joint! We had a blast! Awesome food, great drinks and the entertainment was phenomenal! ",4
" Went on a Friday night, 7:30 reservation. More mature crowd than I expected (between the ages of 35 and 65.) Food was decent. We had a difficult time hearing the singer based on where we were seated, but the music/band was nice from what we could hear. Our server was very attentive, but not intrusive. Nice ambiance for couples. Some tables full of woman out for celebration. Would go back again and be more specific in our table request. Hope that's possible. It took 2 weeks to get our reservation. ",4
" The entertainment and food were great. Also,the service was wonderful! We will be back! ",4
" juke joint service needs improvement. Valet opened the passenger side door and never came to the driver side to open my door. once i opened the door he was there to give me a ticket and take my cash. once we entered the hostess was not at the desk and two other parties were in front of me waiting. hostess should always remain at the desk to welcome guest. by the time the waitress came to our table to take our drink order we were already prepared to order. we had time to review the entire menu and prepare questions about the menu b4 she arrived at our table. there was at least 30 minutes before we received our food. we ordered peach cobbler but they did not have ice cream, it had all melted according to our waitress. ",3
" Although getting in and waiting to be seated was a little chaotic the service was good. The food was very good and served hot, over all a good experience. ",4
" Overall we had a good time. The server was very friendly. There was a small mix up with our original order; but the chef came out to clarify. Once the food arrived, we were all pleased with the presentation, the portion size and flavor. Apparently Georgia's is new to the Brunch scene. I would recommend they update the Brunch menu to include the Side Dish information. The band was great, very nice touch for Brunch setting. They do validate parking; but valet service would be a nice touch. Sweet potato pie for dessert is a winner. ",3
 Loved each time I have been there ,5
 Live band and great energy... Food and service was ok.. Nothing special. ,3
" The food was on average good. The table provided for us was small and not very roomy. The wooden chairs become uncomfortable after sitting for a while. The entertainment was ok but not worth the added $5 to the bill. The service was great, top notch!!! ",4
 The food and service is not as good as when they first opened. The restaurant was not as crowded as it was several months ago which means business is not good. ,3
" This restaurant is good, but they have a lot of rules and do not seem too focused on customer service. For example, they have an entertainment fee that may be applied per person even if you order a meal because they have live music. They also have a limit on the amount of time you can sit at the table. I was shocked that a southern restaurant did not have biscuits or cornbread for the table until I asked the waiter and was told that it was only available upon request (if you know to ask). However, I was even more shocked that they did not have candied yams on the menu. All that said, it's a decent place to eat with good food and average prices. ",3
 Loved the setting and the food and drinks were great ,5
" We had great service,food, and music! ",5
" Horrible service. Jamilah, the hostess has a HORRIBLE attitude...I think she forgot her job title...HOSTESS. ROOT WORD <strong>*HOST</strong>* ",1
" Food was okay. Waiter was good, made a few good drink suggestions. The wine list was subpar. As far as the music, it was okay. Good thing is, they don't have the same musicians play every night. Overall it was an okay place to visit. ",3
" Friendly staff, good blues with dinner - not too loud to carry on conversation. The bread pudding was devine! ",4
" I was there on Sunday, April 8th with 2 friends, the music was especially soothing. The Lead Guitarist and Key board player were very good, the songs were very appropriate and refreshing to hear. ",3
 Went on a Saturday evening for my friend husbands birthday and had a really great time. The waiter was great very personable. Generous food portions. The birthday guys received a complimentary cheesecake with a shot of moonshine! The band was awesome! My husband &amp; friend danced to the band. My friend never gets out but she enjoyed herself so much that she's ready to come back. ,4
" While visiting Atlanta and staying at the Marriott Marquis, the Sweet Georgia Juke Joint was within walking distance. The musical performance was great. The food was delicious, and our server was attentive and charming. We enjoyed it so much, we went back again on Friday! That group was even better, and since we sat at the bar, the bartenders were engaging and our drinks were superb! I definitely recommend this place as one of the finer live music locations downtown. ",4
" The service was second to nOne, the music was great and the food was decent. I will be back!!! ",5
 Took my niece and daughter who were visiting and they loved the live jazz. I will be back. ,4
 Not good for groups because there are a lot of RULES and extra FEES. I will return however I will always sit in the bar area. ,3
" Definitely recommend reservations, b/c it will still take 30 mins. to be seated. Great band, &amp; great food. The drink was just ok, but could have been a bad choice. All in all, I would come back again. ",3
" This restaurant is nice, but the 3-4 young ladies standing at the front counter are HORRIBLE. We notified the ladies that our party was sitting at the bar @ 9pm. We were rudely informed ""your reservation is for 9:30pm, so you wont be seated until then"". Then they started a conversation as if we weren't standing there. There were 3 empty tables along side the wall, one side was a long booth-type seat. I didn't want my night to be ruined, so I went back to the bar &amp; continued to enjoy the band. When 9:30pm came, no one even acknowledged that we were waiting. The 3 empty tables were still vacant as we waited, then 9:40, then 9:45pm. I asked for a manager, then all of a sudden, we were seated in the same spot that was empty when arrived. ",3
 Food was very good. Service was very bad ,2
" Service was unattentive!!!!! Service was very slow, meals came out 15 minutes a part, drinks weren't refilled, and the hostess was rude! Fried chicken was delicious, but I'm not sure the poor service is worth going back for it! ",2
 Food and jazz makes up for the horrible service. ,4
" This was my second time at Sweet Georgia Juke Joint and the food was better than last time. I made a reservation 3 months prior and the hostess tried to seat my party in the back of the restuarant. However, when I asked to be moved, they did accomodate my party. The waiter,(I can't remember his name,provided stellar service). He is a keeper! He recommended what we should order and he made the evening special, since it was my birthday. ",4
" The music was awesone, however, the food was below what I expected. It could have been because it was really busy, but that should not matter. Go with the fried chicken! ",4
 Went for our wedding anniversary . We were treated first class and the band was awesome . ,5
 Need to have more flexiblity on reservation and length of time to dine. ,4
 Had a great time! The band kept the crowd involved and the food was good! The waitress recommended the Peachtini and I ended up buying 4!!! Great for couples or groups!!! ,5
 I had a great time at the Juke Joint. It really has a nice atmosphere and the staff was very courteous. I would definitely go back and reccommend it to my friends. ,4
" I really enjoyed my experience at the restaurant. The live entertainment was awesome and the food was great.  The chicken was not crispy like I like, but it had great flavor and it was moist.  The peach cobbler was the best and I ordered two servings of Mac &amp; cheese.  I will definitely be returning To enjoy the live music.   My server was patient with me and overall a great server. ",5
 Enjoyed live jazz and awesome Gumbo. Only regret was that the music stopped about 10 PM on a Thursday night. Band was great! Did NOT want them to stop. ,5
" Went for southern cuisine and music. Was ok, different. A lot of fried food. ",3
 Food was good but was serverd just lower than room temp. Would be alot better if it were severd hot. ,3
" Fun setting, good food, great service &amp; atmosphere. ",5
" Great food, awesome music the night we were there. ",4
 Having a group of nine at this restaurant was a challenge I thought would give us a problem in a downtown Atlanta restaurant at lunch time. The restaurant was surprisingly uncrowded. We were seated promptly and our server was quick to take our drink order. It fell apart after that. I'm not sure if he was the only server on duty that day but he seemed cold and not very helpful. I would have been much more understanding about this had the restaurant been very crowded but it wasn't so there was no reason why he couldn't have been more attentive. Otherwise we had a nice experience. ,4
" We had an amazing time here celebrating my husband's birthday! The food and drinks were really good. The service was great. Everyone we encountered was pleasant and helpful. They seemed to enjoy being there- I would too with such great live music every night! The band was The PR Experience and they were great. By the end, everyone was up dancing with them.  I read reviews where people said they waited a while for their table even with reservations. We arrived 15 minutes early and were sat 10 minutes early. Pleasant surprise! And a great table at the front right in front of the band. There were a LOT of people without reservations waiting for tables for at least 30 minutes so a reservation is a MUST.  We're positive that we will return ",5
 Great place for dinner and entertainment. The staff and food were excellent! ,4
" Though they say they're known for their fried chicken, you think that they would have mastered ""cooking"" the chicken. My chicken was not fully cooked. The other items ordered were just ok. The best thing about the venue is the live music. So if you want live music, and don't care too much about service and you're not really out for the ""food"" this is the place for you. ",2
" I heard so many great things about the Juke Joint. On my first visit, I was very impressed with the food, service and restaurant itself. I was so impressed, I planned a group luncheon with my co-workers. They were as equally impressed and will definitely plan to return. I chose the peach salmon and potatoes. It was absolutely delicious. I am planning to bring my husband back for his birthday celebration. Great place to be. Love it! ",4
" This was my second visit to the restaurant and I must say the food was not as good. The grits were cold and mealy. My friends broccoli had ice crystals and t his was her first visit; therefore, she wasn't very impressed with the food. You must get the food right every time and all the other stuff won't matter. ",3
 Place was packed and they turned people out so we were lucky to eat there. ,5
" The food &amp; drinks were delicious! The portions were decent &amp; the prices reasonable. We enjoyed appetizers, the main course &amp; shared a dessert. The fried chicken was actually a half chicken, delicious but the side portions were smaller than expected. The shrimp &amp; grits could have had a few more shrimp, but it was good as well. I also enjoyed the Sweet Ga Peach-tini!  We really enjoyed the live performance as well. There isn't a lot of seating &amp; they have time limits on how long you can stay seated (2-3 hours) so expect to wait a minimum of 45 minutes to be seated. The do accept reservations daily so I recommend making those as far in advance as possible. They do have valet parking which is $10 right outside the restaurant doors. ",4
" After making a dinner reservation I was called and told everyone in my party must order an entree. That was my first rude and unprofessional contact with Sweet Georgia's Juke Joint. We tried valet parking and found there really wasn't valet parking as they only have room for 4 or 5 cars. The hostess couldn't find our reservation. Our server was friendly but he was assigned so many tables his visits were few and far between. The sound system for the live music kept going in and out for the lead singer. And finally the hostess decided to make the table for 2 next to us a table for 4, so when we tried to leave there was no way to get between the tables. All in all good food, good music when we could hear it but badly managed ",2
" The food was awesome, the band was hot and the atmosphere.  Make sure to  have a reservation.....makes a big difference. ",4
" Excellent serving staff. They worked as a team, which can be a rare find in the restauant setting. ",5
" Love the resturant, food was great. They should really inform you when making your reservation that you will be rushed through your meal cause you only have a 2 hour period to be at your table, even through there is live music that your coming to see and will not be able to see the entire show. Then 15 mins before your time is up a very unfriendly hostess comes to your table to tell ask have you paid your bill yet cause someone else is waiting on this table. ",4
 The food was average. The price of the food was too expensive. ,3
" I took my husband here for his 24th birthday and we had a blast. When we arrived I had to make last minute changes to our reservation and they were very understanding. We only had to wait about 15mins to be seated. Once seated, the waiter was great! He always made sure that we were comfortable and had everything we needed (all 12 of us). Those in attendance ranged from our one year old to my husband's gradmother--everyone seemed to have a great time. We truly enjoyed the live music and really didn't mind the $5 entertainment fee. It was wonderful seeing my parents and inlaws grooving to the music.Additionally,the restaurant gave my husband a birthday shout-out on the outside monitor AND the owner gave him a shot of ""moon shine"" on the house ",5
" The environment is great and the ambiance is really nice, but the food was just okay and the service could have been better. I would be willing to give it another chance. ",3
 The live music was very good. It definitely meets a juke joint's standards. The food was very good too. ,3
 Love this place. Great music and food!!! ,5
 I was a little unhappy at first after a little hiccup regarding my table being set up with items I provide and drop off for a surprise dinner with my boyfriend. But after talking with a Manager we got it all worked out. When I arrived it was packed and there was a crowd of people waiting to be seated. There was only one hostess and she had to check in people and seat them by herself which made for a very stressful situation for her and guests waiting. Thankfully my table was reserved and we had a good time. The food was good and my waitress was decent. I think they could benefit from having a few more employees working and a little more attention to detail and exceptional customer service. Overall a pretty good experience. ,4
" The food was good, the band was outstanding. The atmosphere was great. It was the weekend before Valentines day and I don't think they were ready. The service was slow, our server was obviously overwhelmed. Overall it was a good experience and I will definitely go back. ",5
 I had the worst experience ever. The wait staff was awful and the general manager was rude and very unprofessional!!! I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone. ,1
" Food was excellent!!! Waiter was overwhelm that night, I don't think he was prepared for the crowd. ",4
 I visited for the first time on my anniversary. We had a good time! ,3
" I will have to say this is one of the best dining experiences my wife and I hav had in downtown ATL. Great food, great fun, great music moderate price...""wow"" expereince. ",5
" My second time at SGJJ and it will probably be my last.  1st, they charge you a $5 entertainment fee, per person, for the band!  Are you serious? I came for food, not for a band. Why not charge me an extra $5 for the bathroom access also? At $5 pp, you have to figure that they make well over $1500 on Sat/Sun in entertainment fees. There is no fee if you find a seat at the bar however...good luck.  Make sure to have a reservation because the place is packed on the weekends. The food is average, nothing spectacular. After ordering appetizers, entrees, desserts, and drinks, they charge another $5 if a new band begins to play during your sitting. The service is lackluster and the hostess make you feel like they're doing you a favor. Overall C- ",3
 When we arrived the lobby was packed which was scary.....but once I informed them of my reservation we were escorted to our table in minutes...the evening was fantastic and the band was great!!!! ,4
" We really enjoyed Sweet Georgia Juke Joint....The Food, Band, Service and Ambiance was AWESOME!!!We loved the old school music the band was playing. We will definetly be returning and we will recommend this spot to our friends. ",5
 We really enjoyed the house band that performed Friday night; they were simply amazing! We will return to hear them again and experience the great food and ambiance at Sweet Georgia. ,5
" If you want a great night, with great food, and no additional stops for entertainment (ie: movies, concert, etc.) Sweet GA's is the place that has it all. Great atmosphere, great servers, and great food. The Seared Duck is to die for! ",5
 Sweet Georgia Juke Joint is a nice spot! Will definitely return to enjoy live music!! ,4
" Pure Excellence!!! Excellent food, entertainment, drinks, and service! My husband and I were out for a well deserved date and all we could say was WOW!!! So glad SGJJ is here! Our server, Nic, was awesome; the owner was very personable and outgoing!We will definitely be back! ",5
" 1st timer!!! Everything was great. Only area of opportunity would be wait time, for parties that make reservations (we waited about 30 minutes) but with the great service, music, and food...that seemed minor afterwards :) ",4
" it was my second time at the Juke Joint! (food was amazing, like last time)! definitely would recommend it to others!! ",4
 Great tasting southern food. After moving back north I've missed some of the simple pleasures of southern food. Enjoyed fried green tomatoes and okra as a starter and shrimp and crawfish étouffée for my main course. All very tasty. Next time will try the catfish and grits. ,4
" Everything was perfect for my dad's birthday occassion. The only thing was that the service was a little slow. We weren't in a hurry so we didn't mind, but our server wasn't necessarily the warmest person either. But great jazz/ live music for a Sunday and the food was amazing. ",4
" Celebrated the birthdays of two friends and everyone in the party enjoyed the setting, the food, the band. It was great, will definatly go back. ",4
 Food was disappointing. Fish  was soggy and appetizer was still frozen ,2
" We met for dinner here with a group of 4 couples, four of us have been friends for a long time, but don't get to see each other very often. We were looking forward to meeting up around the holidays to catch up and enjoy a nice night. We snagged a last minute reservation at 3 Brewers, but shortly after we were seated, a live music act began setting up just behind our table, making it nearly impossible to have a conversation. Just as our food arrived (terrible timing on our part), we asked if there would be any way to switch tables, just so we weren't directly next to the speakers. Since their other large tables were already reserved, the wait staff graciously offered us the private function room, where we could still hear the music performance, but we could also hear each other. Our server came by often enough to make sure we had what we needed and the food/drinks were delicious. The staff really went out of their way to make our night enjoyable and best of all, our bill was quite reasonable. ",4
" It was very good, great place and perfect service! I recommend ",5
" We went to the bar to watch the Canada/USA outdoor game and although there was only one other party at the restaurant at the time of the game and they were watching it, the bar would not put the sound of the game instead of the music which made our time less enjoyable. We also did not see our server for the last hour we were there. ",2
 Great spot for post-Marlies game eats on a Saturday. ,4
" Great service and the food was spot on. Pretty standard menu but they delivered on all of our orders.  I ordered the rack of ribs, and they were fall off the bone with a tasty BBQ sauce. Like I said, pretty standard fare but well done. ",5
 Always a great meal at a great price. And that beer! ,5
" Horrible experience!! Went for dinner with my daughter before a play downtown. I ordered the Reuben sandwich and upgraded fries to ""beer battered Maxi fries"" while my daughter had the goat cheese and roasted red pepper sandwich with regular fries. My Reuben had 2 thin slices of smoked meat and looked like those triangle sandwiches funeral homes put out after a service. The ""Maxi""  fries were not battered at all and looked like regular fries that were over cooked! My daughter's sandwich was cold and the peppers were soggy. We waited 10 minutes to get the malt vinegar and ketchup we asked for because the girl bartending was also one of the 2 servers in a fairly busy restaurant. She didn't stop by once after we got our food  to ask how things were and after waiting 20 more minutes after finishing our horrible food, we asked the only other server for our bill. That also took 20 minutes!! Time to hire new kitchen staff and more servers or no one will eat at 3 Brewers!! ",1
" Jackie our server was delightful, friendly and service oriented. ",4
" We were greatly disappointed with our experience this day. We were there for lunch prior to the Argonaut Playoff game which started at 1:00 pm. We arrived on time at 11:30 am and ordered our meals at approximately 12:00. At 12:50 we still had not received any food. We stayed as long as we could and then advised the waiter that we would be leaving.  To his credit, he did not allow us to pay for our drinks. This was our second time at this establishment. Our first visit was satisfactory but I for one will not hurry back. ",2
 the beer here gives the worst hangovers. My particular dish was awful and looked nothing like the picture. ,3
 Good food and good beer. Slow service because they were not staffed properly. Pleasant wit staff. ,4
 Great spot to check out the game or have a quick bite with friends. ,5
" Amazing place, had such a great time. Food was delicious, beer was superb, service was phenomenal. Thank you for everything!! ",5
 Service and food both very good. Great place to eat if going to Exhibition Park. Easy walk to park. ,4
 A very chilland friendly environment. The staff goes out of their way to help out in any way they can. ,5
" Food and ambiance was good, kitchen was a bit slow but we were a group of 6 so having fun. They brought us fries on the house to make up for it. ",3
" Food was good and came quickly , the waitress was excellent, very attentive. ",4
" Unfortunately my party of six did not have the best experience at our outing to 3 Brasseurs.  The venue was selected over others in Liberty Village based on its high rating and positive reviews.  This was a special occasion for us with my sister, brother in law and two of their friends who had traveled from North Bay to attend a concert featuring the Doobie Brothers and Chicago at the  nearby Budweiser Stage.  We reserved two hours prior to concert time however due to a lack of staff present (one staff tried to cover the entire second floor) service was very slow.  A nice setting for a visit however we were worried the delays would make us late for the concert (which it did) and when the food finally arrived we had to eat as quickly as possible, pay and run off.  Not the experience I had hoped for. ",2
" Food and drinks were quite good, but restaurant was horribly understaffed on a summer Wednesday evening. Despite having a reservation we were seated upstairs in what appeared to be a closed section and waited a lonnng time to be served ",3
" Food wasn't well prepared - either too cold or over cooked. Ordered poutine - cheese curds were cold and fries were lukewarm, kids burgers were overcooked and dry, kids ice cream dessert was completely melted and missing ingredients. The other dishes (tuna poke, sausages) we had were good. Service was pleasant but painfully slow. ",2
" Went here for dinner before a concert. The food was excellent with some unique dishes such as the chicken and waffle sandwich. The service we received was terrible. We had to flag someone down to get service after a lengthy wait to start. Parts of our order was missing, we were never given any condiments and no one came back to check on us. ",2
 The beer is amazing ! Food is also good. The vibe was a little confusing for the restaurant but I really did enjoy the service and food ,4
 Pre Toronto FC dinner. Excellent beer and food. Gets really busy so good idea to reserve. Will definitely visit again. ,5
 Came with family and friends for a quick bite. Food was ok. But wasn't looking for a gourmet meal so was pretty much what I expected. Staff were nice but took forever for someone to take our order or check in with us throughout the meal. Music was too loud. Front colleagues need more coaching and with that and better noise level the place will be much better! ,2
" Food was ok...got a chicken sandwich, and it just seemed like they slapped a slice of cheese on it at the last minute. ",4
" Great place to stop at for an evening out with friends. Atmosphere is great.. The food was decent. I had the chicken and waffles but the chicken was a little rubbery. Management took care of that pretty quickly though and the service was great. The ""flamm's"" (flatbreads) were really good.  I would definitely go back again to try some more food and enjoy some more beer. ",4
" The food was great and the service was friendly! There was a decent selection of great sounding foods to try, which made choosing a dish difficult--and obviously means I'll have to return. The advertised Brunch also looked delicious. ",4
" Went to watch some sports, have appetizers &amp; a few drinks. If you're only going with 2 people tables are situated in the best spots to get a tv view. Nachos were o.k barely any cheese. Drinks were good and service was alright. ",4
 Way too loud...TVs. Otherwise great food and service ,4
 Our server is on fire! Super attentive in a non intrusive way! ,5
 Good food and service.  Only downside was there were too many people standing at the bar and the top of the stairs and where we were seated people kept bumping into us or the table.  Other than that great place to meet before or after a game. ,4
" The beer was very, very good.  Much better then the first time I tried their in-house brews 8 years ago (when they first came to Toronto).  They have come along way since then and I commend them for that.  :)  The staff were very friendly and our waitress even commented that we looked like were friends catching up so she tried her best to not intrude too much when checking up on us.  The food was good, there was lot of room; as in they did not pack the tables too close together so you could barely move.  The decor and ambiance were also very relaxed but inviting.  I look forward to checking them out when the whether is nicer to see what kind of patio they offer. ",5
 We ordered the chicken entre and the portions were small. The pull pork was very salty ,3
 3 Brewers is good restaurant. Value for money is there and the space they are in is really nice. The food is solid and the beers offered are great. ,4
 The food and service was amazing! My server was fun and on top of things. The food was delicious especially the beer battered garli  fries!!! They accomodates me special request for the party and ensured we were ok witj everything! The beer selection was great as well. And the deal of getting a row of beers and a free pizza is always a good restaurant in my books! Will definitley be returning! ,5
 First time going here and i lived it.  The beer was great and so was the food.   I've already recommended it to several friends. ,5
" Good for couples hang out have some conversations, but for the service, not really what we expecting ",3
 Great beer. Service was fast and courteous. Altogether made my brief stop easy and enjoyable. ,5
" First time to this chain. Very empty and quiet on Jan 2 but that's ok. Seated right away, service initially was quick but towards the end we had to wave our waitress over to get the bill.  Food was OK. I had the beef stew which came with two very tiny pieces of baguette, no butter.  My friends flatbread (sorry I forget all the odd sounding names) looked fantastic and I wished that I had ordered from that section of the menu instead!  Overall, the price for beer brewed on site was FANTASTIC, food was tasty and I'd go back for sure. ",4
" The food was OK but highly priced, the service was lousy. We had an 11:30 reservation and one of the first groups to arrive and the only one with a reservation and was seated last. The food took about 45 minutes to arrive. No bread served even when asked. Had to wait another 20 minutes after getting to go boxes for the check to arrive. The music was good and the restaurant had a good atmosphere, they need to work on service however. ",3
 the seared ahi was overcooked. the fish seemed like it was cooked in a pan that was not hot enough to do a quick sear of the outside of the fish. ,4
 Our experience in December was nice but this time... Japanese chef has been already left ?  We miss the wagon service of pupu and fresh and beautiful pastas... ,3
 We really enjoyed the ambiance at the restaurant with the band which kept us entertained all night. We arrived at 6pm and did'nt leave until about 8:15.Not enough food for the price. The service was pretty good but overall we enjoyed ourselves. ,4
 For so many southern favorites the food was average. However drinks were very good and it was great to watch live music. Stick with apetizers and fish sandwich ,3
 Too many hidden prices! The parking which usually is complimentary with dinning is $10 soon as you pull up without warning There is an additional $5 per person entertainment fee just to eat while the entertainment is going on! The food was not that great and my meat was badly burned! I do believe there concept is great but all of the extra fees takes away from the classiness of the place! ,1
" The food was nothing to write home about and the hostess team was not helpful, inefficient and provided invalid information about parking. The atmosphere was great. Dinner somewhere else and dessert &amp; drinks here go well with the LIVE MUSIC. ",3
" Co-workers and I (11 people) decided to have a holiday luncheon. We were seated promptly but our waitress was very slow, rude, and not very accomodating. She was very unprofessional. Her demeanor was not friendly. She was very slow in taking our food orders. Our reservation was at 12:30p and our food order was not taken for at least 30 minutes. The restaurant was not packed with patrons. In fact, another group was seated near us at least 20 minutes after we arrived and they received their food before us. They were getting their checks as our food was being delivered. I asked for a sandwich without bacon and upon notifying the waitress. She told me that ""she does not work in the kitchen."" I was very disappointed with teh service. ",1
 Went to Sweet Georgia's for my birthday and had a group of 12 with me. We were easily accommodated and the service was excellent. The music positively added to the ambiance and I was still able to hold conversations and hear my friends over the music (sat right next to the band). ,5
 Overall great experience for my bday celebration...the show was awesome and overall the food was good but our server had to many tables ,4
 I think Sweet Georgia's Juke Joint is a great place to visit.Great entertainment and food! Sunday at 7 was really slow but due to another large party going on our service was slower then liked. However band kept our mind off of the slow service. ,4
" Good service. Great food. Parking not so easy, but to be expected for downtown Atlanta. ",4
" Edwana was CELEBRATING her 75th Birthday and it was Great! Because of the Holiday weekend it was ""sparse"" but worked well because Edwana and Guests could be comfortable and have FUN! If we could do it again we would!  Life is GOOD! Would recommend it to Anyone! ",4
" Beautiful venue with a great ambiance. Food was ok, but the service and ambiance were great! ",4
 The service was fantastic but the food lacked big time. The manager did come to our table and appologize because the Chef was new and did compensate the overdone steak. He and the service staff were awesome! We've been there many times before and everything was great but this time it was different. Hopefully the Chef will get it together. ,5
" It is special because respect is evident and felt all the way around - the place, the beauty, the manners, service, food - one feels as in a long established place of traditional beauty in all respects, and feels special just being there, then is treated with special respect. Did not find it 'short' anywhere. ",5
" Love the new restaurant located on the former John Dominis' site. Elegant and classy, definitely a special place I hope to frequent! ",4
 Where can you find a lovelier spot! The view of Diamond Head and ocean is unbeatable. Great service and elegant restaurant. ,4
" Quite disappointing. It is definitely geared for the Japanese trade. The hostess, Stephanie was terse. The food was fairand the head waiter didn't listen to my request to bag tne uneaten entrees instead he blamed me for saying that I said I was full. Also people in shorts were allowed to dine so why do you even stress a dress code? ",1
" I question the value (and appropriateness) of reviewing a restaurant that is still in its soft opening, because there is so much in flux and what you're getting may not be their ""final product"". That said, our experience here was fantastic...from drinks before dinner to cappuccino. The structure and view are breathtaking, food was excellent, and the service was top-notch (thanks Jay!). I highly recommend their Seafood Showcase appetizer: Maine lobster, alaskan king crab, ahi, kampachi and seared scallops. It says you need to order for two, but I could've easily ordered this and finished it myself.  Really, a great dining experience. We'll be heading back for sure. ",5
" Excellent Itlaian cuisine mixed with local seafood dishes that work well together. Absolutely beatiful new restautant with awesome views along Waikiki toward Diamond Head. Still some uneven service (forgetting items, empty glases, rushing courses, etc.) that needs to be worked out for a truly fine dining experience. ",4
 Food was outstanding and the price fixe menu a nice surprise. Very good value for lunch. Kelsey provided excellent service as well. I'll be back. ,5
" Beautiful views, decent food (a little salty and the portions were tiny), great service. The wine pours were a little light. My client complained about the wine pour and the waitress took it away and came back with the same amount. ",4
" Great view, Great food, Great service and Great for wedding celemony or party. The view of Diamondhead is amazing!! I will definitely come back the restaurant soon. ",5
 The view is fantastic &amp; I recommend going for lunch or early dinner. The menu is adequate but could use a few tweeks as well as a few more vegetarian items. I have been there 3 times and have enjoyed the food very much. ,3
" Flavors are exceptional, very attentive service, piano bar exceptional with Noly at the key boards. ",5
" Upon arrival we were ""WOWED"" by the dramatic entrance and warm welcome. We loved the classic and very understated decor (although the table was a bit small for 4 people). We tried several of the recommendations including the Rib Eye (Chef's Specialty); unfortunately, the food was just okay. We were enjoying ourselves until a big group came in-- they were very loud and didn't seem to care if they were disturbing the other guests. Conversation became difficult and the intimate and cozy ambiance was destroyed. It would have been nice if the staff had asked them to tone it down a little. ",3
 entrees were average but everything else was excellent. ,5
" Liked the ambiance and stunning view of Diamond Head and Ala Moana Beach. Also enjoyed my opakapaka although I didn't like that it was placed on top of the sweet potato.  There was a couple with a baby who needed a high-chair. The chair was placed on the walkway side of the table which made it difficult to pass through. Other than that, it was a nice experience. ",4
 The oceanfront locale provides unparalleled stunning distant views of Diamondhead and the surf. Go for lunch as it is a great value inclusive of a selection of appetizers and dessert. The Itallian cuisine is good but predictable. Noise level can get high though probably due to the floor to ceiling glass and marble. Overall worth a visit for special occasions and out of town friends. ,4
" Everything was great. The service, the building, the views, and the food. But only the fillet mignon steak was too blunt and disappointing. ",4
" 53 By The Sea continues to deliver wonderful dining experiences after several months of operation. The Spectacular Views of Diamond Head, Kewalo Basin and Ala Moana Beach combine with a truly elegant facility and a well trained staff that consistently deliver exceptional food &amp; beverage service at a reasonable price at lunch. The isolated location near Kakaako Point Panic is still close to Waikiki by Car/Taxi; this is not a restaurant that will ever receive foot traffic. The combination Appetizer/Entree/Dessert for a set price really adds to the value of the dining experience.The Restaurant also houses Wedding Chapels/Banquet Rms ",5
 food was terrible and over priced limited menu  would not refer a friend or go back ,1
 The view is gorgeous and the service is top-notch! The lunch value is outstanding - included with your meal are appetizers from the appetizer cart and a small dessert of the day. I recommend the lunch highly! ,4
 This was my third visit. The first was with a friend; the second with the friend and a couple; and this was with my office staff. The first two visits were at night; the last one at noon.I still would like to have the occasion to sit outside.I wonder why your phone reception tells me all the time that there were no tables available at the time I requested and when I come one third of the tables are not occupied? ,4
" This restaurant looks fake and out of place in Hawaii. I thought we had pulled up to and then entered someone's tacky house in Las Vegas. When we pulled into the drive there was even an open garage looking door with a lot of cars and equipment inside in it and it was very unsightly. The so called entry is out of proportion and so are the furnishings. The staircase is roped off which didn't matter. The windows facing the view are highly reflective and don't open. The wait staff can't figure out whether to have their white gloves on or off. The menu has a decent selection, but poor delivery. The tomato soup tasted like Marinara sauce from a jar and our friend liked his fish but there was so little of it, he went home for PB&amp;J. ",1
 I love here. They are always welcome guests and great customer service. Foods are good also. I could not eat any seafood though they make special dish for me. :-) ,5
" I went to this restaurant recently and the service and food were both excellent. The entrees are ala carte, so the sides are family style, enough for 2 maybe 3 people. ",5
" Nice view of Waikiki and Dimond Head from distance.  But, expect to wait 30 minutus for your first dish to come out and 15 minutes between dishes. ",4
" Very friendly service by waiter Scott and helpers. There could have been a little more attention to detail for a fine dining restaurant. We had to ask for our water to be refilled twice, more bread and also waited while our waiter couldn't find dessert menus. We enjoyed the appetizers but the best dish was the Lobster linguine. Great presentation, nice portion size and excellent tasting. We would definitely order the Fresh sea bass and Seared ahi again. Excellent view of Waikiki Friday night fireworks! The wait staff let's you know in advance that the restaurant lights will be turned down so we could enjoy the beautiful fireworks show. Nice touch for special occasion or out out of town guests. ",5
" Our whole experience was 1st class, have already recommended 53 by The Sea. They has a special dessert plate made for us for our 18th wedding anniversary, will definately go back soon ",5
" Attentive staff, simple and tasty menu options, fine dining at an affordable price. What more can you ask for? ",5
" Food and staff were great EXCEPT for the waitress. She clearly didn't want to be there and didn't know how to work tables. It was so bad that I told a floor manager about the service on the way out. The bus boys and helpers were awesome. The food was good, the view was nice. ",4
" They had sea bass, always a hit with me and it was delicious!! They made a special birthday dessert for my husband which was very sweet . The service was very good, over all an excellent experience. ",5
 Excellent overall felt like it was a great value for the ambiance and food ,5
 We went for my wife's birthday. Table was well situated with an excellent view Staff were very helpful and attentive. Food selection was good and prepared excellently. Definitely will return. Only thing missed was the stream that used to rub through John Dominis when it was there. ,5
" It was my wife`s birthday and put this in the comment when we booked this restaurant. We were looking forward to the special dessert or something special. I even told the waitress that it was my wife`s birthday when we sat at the table. The dessert came out at the end of our meal but didn`t look special and her birthday was not acknowledged. We thought maybe this restaurant does not give out anything special for birthdays and decided to leave. Just before we exited, I asked the male manager if the restaurant acknowledges birthdays and he said yes. I told him what had happened and he just said he was sorry and will speak to the waitress concerned. My wife and I were very disappointed. The food was great but service was disappointing. ",3
" Food was very good, excellent view, great service, but the noise level was terrible. Could barely hear conversation of people at my table. ",3
" It is new and replaces a very special John Dominis. The building is beautiful but very neutral. The view was not as grand as the previous. All in all it is very nice but for the money there are much better experiences. I would recommend Michel's, Longhi's, and many others. Also great for a wedding. ",4
 It has a great view with ocean and very clean.. Next time I will try again if possible. But the price is......... ,4
 Beautiful restaurant with great view! ,4
 The Lobster Bisque is over priced and tiny. Don't waste your money! ,3
" Amazing views, very attentive service and great food at a reasonable price. I have been there twice for client meetings. It is a beautiful location, nicely off the beach and slightly away from all the tourists. Spectacular views and a beautiful space. ",5
 The pastas we very al dente to the point of having to really work on it. Tastes were very good. Ambiance was very good with an upscale flare. You get a view looking out toward Diamond Head and the ocean. Service was excellent. Lunch prices would be considered reasonable considering it includes appetizer and dessert. Two types of bread is served. I would heartily recommend this restaurant to all. ,4
" Most places with incredible views in Honolulu have average food. The food here was good. It wasn't as good or special as the price was high. However, the view was worth every penny we spent. The service was very good except that they cancelled our Open Table reservations for no reason. We were able to call and reinstate them. I would go back for a special treat and would recommend it to anyone who wanted to celebrate a special occasion. I grew up in Honolulu and know of a lot of great ""view"" places, but this one ranks near or at the top. ",4
" The food was good, but portions were mini-sized by Hawaii standards. The menu was very limited, a couple of pastas and a couple of sea food dishes, and the smallest steak I have ever seen served in a restaurant. Service was rather slow but decent, nothing to rave about. This is a restaurant obviously owned by and operated primarily for Japanese tourists who are looking more for an experience than a place to eat. The view of Diamond Head and the coast along Ala Moana Beach Park is fantastic. For locals, this might be a good place to go for cocktails and a relaxed conversation. Don't go if you are hungry, you'll be disappointed. ",2
" What a wonderful surprise and near downtown instead of Waikiki. The decor is outstanding and elegant. The food presentation was beautiful and very tasty. A bit expensive, but totally worth it. ",5
" I'd had been hre b4 4 dinner &amp; had great time - atmosphere, service &amp; food - it was all excellent. But, this time I came for lunch. Unbeknownst 2me....after reading other reviews - I read the original chef went back 2Japan. True or not, the food took a nosedive in quality. Void of flavor, vegies overcooked &amp; an appetizer set up that is the WORST concept imaginable. A cart of a variety of appetizers of which small amt is given. Some were tasty &amp; some not. But NO CHOICE. First time 4lunch, perhaps I was to already have known this? Attention to detail by wait staff definitely not up to expectations. Forgot requests, unfamiliarity with dishes &amp; handling the appetizer cart ""process"" was not good. Never again 4 lunch...maybe 1 more try 4dinner? ",2
 I really like the OpenTable mechanism to make reservations but I have actually stopped submitting reviews including private notes to the restaurants because there has been ZERO follow up and/or acknowledgements when they were requested. So please discontinue asking for reviews. ,1
" Impressive ambiance, awesome food, great service, for a newly opened restaurant. Definitely will go back there again! ",5
 We enjoyed our dinner very much. Jay was a gracious head waiter as we're the other servers. While waiting for our table we were comped our drink - club soda. Very thoughtful of restaurant. Halo green salad outstanding and plentiful. Bass awesomely prepared and delicious. Sorbet and eggplant desserts perfect conclusions to the meal. Mahalo for a lovely evening. ,5
 Awesome place and great food and service. This is worth the reservation if you can get one! Make this a stop on your list when in Honolulu. ,5
 Great restaurant; excellent food and ambiance; KILLER VIEW!!! ,4
" I had a great lunch time with guests from Japan. It was cloudy but enjoyed scene from restaurant, we enjoyed our lunch. Our server was good job, food was good, exactly I'll back to lunch again. ",4
 Excellent service! Excellent food! Making reservations for my birthday :) ,5
" Gorgeous, romantic view of the Waikiki skyline. Only thing was the noise from the two large groups seated nearby. Otherwise would've been very romantic. ",4
 Excellent food and outstanding services! ,5
" Awesome view, great friendly staff and spectacular structure. ",5
 Celebrated a friend's birthday. She felt so special because of the fantastic food and atmosphere. Service was attentive. Will be back. ,5
 EVERYTHING WAS AMAZING!! From the service to the staff friendliness to the ambiance to the food to the attentiveness to everything...simply amazing! ,5
" Just happen to notice this place on a bus ride and decided to do 'something different' for our anniversay. Although it was stormy and raining, it was a wonderful time. The food was great and the music a pleasent surprise. Love it! On the website it said there was valet parking, but when we pulled up, no one was outside to take the car, and parking in the suggested parking lot was a nightmare to walk out from, as we and another couple we ran into, could not find our way out. The space is a nice size and I love being able to make reservations on line. Over all it was a very nice evening. ",5
" This is a great spot for good food, live entertainment, excellent service, friendly patrons, all in a very beautiful setting. SGJJ is a nice blend of modern-chic club and traditional juke joint. Always fun for a couple or a group. ",5
 I visit The Juke Joint Often I bring my client for dinner and entertainment we always have a great time ,5
" Juke Joint could be a good option for people working downtown or groups who are looking for a casual lunch, and want a little more than a foodcourt. The food overall was pretty good, and the space was nice as well. What kind of overshadowed the quality of the food though was the really bad service. Especially for a place that I'm sure hopes to attract fairly big groups, the speed of the service needs to be improved. Specifically, it took 25 minutes for our drinks to arrive, and 45 minutes for our food to arrive. For a lunch place in downtown, it doesn't matter how good the food is, it needs to be faster. ",3
 the service was very slow for a lunchtime crowd that was not large - our waitress had no clue what being on a gluten free diet ment - she didn't seem to be in any rush to get us through our lunch - portions are tiny - we tried this because it was near the office and wanted to try something new - we will not be going back and I would not recomend this place to anyone ,1
" I really like the idea of this place. The menu looks great and I want to support downtown small business, but the execution was not great. The food was bland and not the right temperature; like it had been sitting out awhile. Maybe better as a night time cocktail place. ",2
" Most of the southern specialtys were unavailable the day that I went. Food was not spectacular at all. Very touristy, overpriced and loud. Not for native Atlantans, good for groups on business trips trying to get a false sence of southern food. Music was not even playing and it was loud. Staff was friendly. Food took too long to arrive. Would not recommend nor would I return. ",2
 Very nice atmosphere and the food is very good. I have only been here for lunch and there is always a big crowd. I will have to go for dinner. ,5
" Went around 1:15pm for lunch. Seated immediately! Decor very nice! Based on the website was expecting live music. Apparently, soloist did not show up. No music(disappointing), but what you could hear was a large party's conversation and because the restaurant was quiet except for the party's loud outbursts, it felt more like a school lunchroom, than a nice dining experience. As for the meal, I had the fried chicken wings, mac n cheese &amp; collards, my friend had the salmon, with the same sides. The wings were hot, but the rest of the food was only luke warm. Meal just ok. Quality of food not high, portions small, especially for the price $33 for the two meals, w/ no drinks. ",2
 Entertainment was great - Menus selections should be changed ocassionally. Table service was very good. ,3
" I went with a business associate and our experience was excellent. Our server, Antonio, was terrific and we really enjoyed the live Blues music! I would certainly give this spot a high recommendation to others touring in the downtown area. ",5
" Since we had reservations, the wait wasn't very long. However, we were seated so close to another party, we might as well have been dining with them! It was a little too close for comfort. I ordered the half fried chicken and it was a little dry. My husband said his brisket was a little too salty for his taste. The entertainment was great though. This place may be more suitable for late night drinks and appetizers only. ",3
" I must say that my experience at SGJJ was not exactly great, mainly due to my critical palette. If you are not afraid of spicey food, then this is the place for you. From our table for four we ordered Rib eye, Catfish, Ribs, Shrimp and Grits, and two Desserts. I am afraid that no one was able to give rave reviews. Our side order of greens and the rib sauce splattered on the ribs was so hot that it was very difficult to get down without a fire hose. The mac and cheese was not hot and had to be returned and the dessert (Peach Cobbler and Bread Pudding) was less than we expected. The music and ambiance was great, so if you are looking for somewhere to hang out for drinks, than this is it, but eat somewhere else. ",2
" I love this place, I think the staff up front seemed a little inexperienced and they were getting confused on seating people so they were very friendly. However my waiters, yes waiter because she was trying someone were great. The food was awesome, and I love the selection. I crawfish, and the shrimp and grits, plus sweet pototoes (one of my favorites) and mac and cheese. Potions were big I did not finish and I weight 185. However, I was talking to my friend and I said this place would be great if the bring out breadcorn to start. I swear right after that all the waiters start bring they ppl cornbread, some how we did not get any!! I was a little upset about that but I did not need them lol.. O yea remember to get Ms. Celie Lemonade ",4
" Very excellent experience. Food was great! Awesome atmosphere. Band was good, great service. My friend, who was visiting the city, returned the very next day. ",5
" Love, love, love Sweet Georgia Juke Joint! This has definitely become one of my favorite restaurants.  I've taken my family and freiends there and they all have fallen in love with this eatery.  The food is delicious and service is outstaning! I can't wait to go back again. ",5
 I tried the Juke Joint on a whime and it was wonderful! I had no idea there would be live jazz and the food was excellent. I highly recommend a trip to downtown ATL and visit this spot. ,5
" This was my second time visiting Sweet Georgia within a month and both times my experience was excellent! I went at the beginning of March and they'd only been open for about two weeks and this weekend was evident that the word has gotten out about Sweet Georgia. It was packed and standing room only. The live music is the best I've heard in a long, long time. I rated the service good because it does take a little longer for the food to get to the table and this was my experience both times. Our waitress was fabulous and served like a pro. I am looking forward to my third visit! ",5
" The food was great, the band was great (the fuzion project), and the price was straight. ",5
" Nice atmosphere....great band, (Breeze Kings) and the food was very good. ",5
 The Music can be somewhat load for such close quarters. Otherwise a very wonderful experience. ,4
 I enjoyed the experience my family and I had on Friday evening. The staff was very friendly. We got the food very quick. The music was great. I will be back with friends. ,5
" My girlfriend and I were very happily surprised by this restaurant. We were a little unsure from the outside, but as soon as we went in we felt welcome and noticed how cool and upscale this place was. Great atmosphere, with a great live musician playing on a stage just a few tables away. The food was good barbeque, not big portions but tasty. We left smiling. ",4
" I had a great time at this place! Music was good, food was good, great crowd and band. However, we sat for 30 minutes (yes thirty) before a waitress finally came over. ",4
 the band Infusion Project was the best part of the night. they were excellent. ,3
 Met friends from out of town who had been there the night before. The staff remembered them. The owners visited our table several times to make sure we were having a good time. Wait staff was pleasant and attentive.You could tell that they work well together. The food was good - Southern with a twist. Especially enjoyed the White Cheddar Macaroni! The entertainment was great - Ms Valerie Hines really enjoys entertaining. She even walked around after her set and thanked everyone. Fuzion Project was also good. I'll be telling friends about Juke Joint and will definitely return. ,5
 I was very pleased with my visit. The atmosphere was very relaxing and vibrant all at the same time. I will visit again and recommend to all my associates. ,4
 Great place for mature audience ,5
 The restaurant is in a good location. The atmosphere was good with a live jazzy/blues band. The food presentation was nice and delicious. ,4
" The order is late,The first plate is 60 minutes laterThere is no service.All is too slow. ",1
 Food could be better to match the decor. ,4
" I wonder if it would have made a difference to have an early lunch rather than 1:15pm. Would the food be much better? The noise level during the lunch period was high. We were seated facing the ocean and the glare from the sun or reflection from the water was a bit annoying. It was recommended to us to have lunch at 53 by the Sea because of the abundant selections of appetizers, which was not the case for us. Although the 4 selections we did have was pretty good. I had a pasta dish which was a little dry for a pasta dish. ",3
" Ambience was romantic. You could tell a lot of money was spent to build the restaurant and surrounding facility. View of the Ala Moana and Waikiki area was beautiful. Wine list was extensive. Service wasn't as bad as I had heard. In fact, Tia was knowledgable about menu items and very attentive. Bar area looked interesting and so did the outdoor seating (bar). Server said it can be nice, but also windy outside. ",4
 Too bad the weather was not good. The view was great expect for the over cast weather. I enjoyed the food very much. The price for lunch was reasonable for special occasions. ,4
 What a delightful new restaurant. Can't wait to go back ,5
 We had an excellent experience. The view was incredible and the food as well. ,5
 Not too impressed. The foods were OK. We had better with the same price range before. The service was OK. I think you can spend your money at other place and get better foods. We go to Honolulu every year for X'mas. I am pretty sure. We won't go back there in the future. ,3
" Seafood stew was excellent. Since I like things on the hot side, others may want to request a more mild dish. ",5
" As others may have commented, this is a beautiful and romantic restaurant. If only the service was half as good. We had inquired with our waiter on whether a spicy dish could be done w/o spice. We had to ask him twice until he checked. When the dish came out, it was spicy. His response was that at least we got another for free. We were there celebrating my gfried's bday. Earlier waiter advised that she will get a dessert. We ordered a separate dessert, but her bday dessert never came. We had to remind them. His assistant waitress was very nice and pleasant. He got the nerve to tell us at the end of the night ""He enjoyed serving us."" Did he really? ",2
" Been there 5 times this month, Entrees are excellent; appetizers are okay. Service is inconsistent. Generally good but on many occassions, we had to ask for pepper or cheese (for pasta). ",4
" The food was very good to excellent. The service (Christina) was impeccable, perhaps the best restaurant service I have ever encountered. Not an inexpensive evening but at the same time, very special. ",4
" Ask for a table by the windows--there are many. Food, wine, service and ambiance are good but the view is one of the best. It was tough to get a reservation when we wanted to go. We tried several times without success. Not sure how long in advance it really takes to get a prime time weekend reservation, but it is certainly more than a week. We finally went on a weekday and even then needed several days advance booking. ",4
" Food was so-so for a place with so much ambiance. But price was reasonable for a place with this much ambiance, too. ",3
" A beautiful view, great food and excellent service. We will definitely be back. ",5
 beautiful view of diamond head; fair price but could include iced tea or coffee; great for lunch with the girls ,4
" This was our first time visiting 53 by the Sea. We have been to most of the fine dining locations in Honolulu. 53 by the Sea was outstanding. We had a wonderful time and the food was fantastic. The staff were very friendly and amenable to our needs. We started out with the 53 Seafood Showcase and we loved it. The lobster and scallops were perfect and the sashimi melted in your mouth. The Heart of Romaine salad came next. The waitress rolled up a cart next to our table and prepared the baby romaine hearts in front of us. Presentation was nicely done and the salad, and dressing, was delightful. For dinner, my wife had the Grilled Veal Chop and I had the Grilled Black Angus Filet Mignon with the Cabernet wine reduction. Both were excellent. ",5
 A great addition to Honolulu dining. Spectacular views of Diamond Head and ocean. Outstanding service. Too bad there is no outdoor dining yet even though the restaurant has the space for it. ,5
" Our first time here. The service was outstanding, the best anywhere I've been. People who work here behave like they appreciate the business and value their customers - something often lacking in many fine dining places. The restaurant is more than adequately staffed, good for customers but concerned me whether they could sustain it. The food is prepared and presented with care. Food is delicious, steak perfectly cooked, not over-seasoned. View was a delight, they were able to accommodate my window request so we got a great view of the fireworks. I look forward to going again! ",5
" Overall a very nice dinner, with good service. ",4
" Excellent service and if you remember what John Dominis looks like, it is nothing like Dominis. I ordered fish and it was too overdone, but I didn't have the heart to complain because the service was out of this world excellent. ",4
" Had birthday dinner here recently, there were 6 in our party, overall the experience was good. everyone enjoyed their meals, the salads were large enough to share, we had teh ceser and 53 by the sea nalo greens. For entres, I had the opakapaka which I enjoyed, other meals were the Mahimahi, risotto, linguini with red sauce and sausage, opah, and lamb chops. Waters were kept full and bread served promptly. Since it was a birthday celebration, a dessert combo of tiramisu, fruit sorbet and slice fruit on a plate decorated with a chocolate birthday greeting was complimentary. All went well till the end when a gelato order was missed, and then our left over to go bags never appeared. ",4
" Our table was beautiful and the waiters were great. However, I would recommend that you eat @ the bar. The bartenders are the bomb and made our night enjoyable. The service is also a lot quicker there. Enjoyed the 53 Seafood Showcase, Mushroom Risotto, 8oz Prime Rib and the Lobster Bisque (although it's very pricey for such a small serving). The Chilled Lobster w/Fresh Local Greens, Escargot Stuffed Mushrooms and the Fried Zucchini (bland - needs to be accompanied by a dip)left something to be desired. The Lemon Cream Cake was okay - would have preferred a bread pudding, chocolate cake or creme brulee. Quite pricey - but would go again to hang at the bar and have the Risotto. ",3
" We were unable to get the reservation we wanted, so we were seated at 8:30 p.m., long after the sun had set. When it is dark outside, there is no view. We had asked for a table close to the door, as one of our party had trouble walking. So of course, we were ushered to the very very very back of the restaurant. The thing that hit us immediately upon entering the restaurant was the very loud noise. It was not ""energetic""... it was just too darn loud, probably because so much tile and glass is used in the construction of the restaurant. Our waitress was very patient and courteous with us, explaining the menu and so forth, but there were several times when we wondered where she had gone and what she was doing. She certainly didn't hover. ",3
 We enjoyed the experience and great food. ,4
 not too fond of the armless chairs but they do look nice. ,5
" Beautiful restaurant from location to decors! Exquisite entry and staircase welcomes guests to a totally panoramic view of Diamond Head n the ocean! Outstanding services, comprehensive wine list, the prix-fixe menu is deliciously varied and tastes so good that calls for encore dine-out!to Dessert was exquisite, light, yet flavorful and beautifully prepared! Just a wonderful dining experience! Thanku Chef!!!! ",5
 A+ in all aspects! My new favorite restaurant ,5
" Three of us celebrated a friend's birthday on December 7th. We were told it is ""dressy casual"" but there were several Japanese couples that seemed to have arrived after a day of touring: shorts, t-shirts and slippers. The restaurant obviously is aimed at the Japanese market. Our waiter, Scott, was as good as it gets. He was professional, explained the menu thoroughly and checked on us constantly to insure we were satisfied with our experience. We were shocked to be charged $15 for a birthday plate which, incidentally, had the same items as the prix fixe menu which two of our party ordered. Warning: don't tell them it's a special occasion or you will be charged for it! ",4
" I had dinner at 53 by the Sea. The restaurant is beautiful and brand new. The staff was courteous and friendly. I ordered the $70 course dinner. The food was OK. The main dish(grilled opakapaka) came cold and the pasta(Fruitti de Mare) was over spicy. With same kind of food, I would prefer going to Taormina or Bernini. ",3
 53 By the Sea is great! The food is AWSOME! 4th time we've go e and taken someone from the mainland and they loved it too! ,5
 Lovely light and fresh food. Attentive service wonderful ambiance. ,5
 We had an excellent experience at 53 By the Sea. It was a birthday special occasion so the service and atmosphere was perfect. Will recommend and will return... ,5
 Lovely location along the waterfront at sight of a previous local favorite. No one liked the pieces of dried bread offered in the beginning and had not been served water or drinks yet. Were a bit slow to fill water glasses in beginning. Nice table side presentation for salad. Soup of the day delicious as well as entrees of risotto and clams and chicken Marsala. Favorite was the lemon cake for dessert. All found the lowering of the house lights to be able to watch the fireworks with synchronized piano music very special. One in our party wears a hearing aid and found the back ground noise/acoustics plus piano music a bit difficult to carry on conversation easily. ,4
" Beautiful view of Waikiki, quiet place for lunch if you get there early. Very attentive service.  Good place to take visiting guests. Fresh pasta was excellent! ",4
 Very nice and relaxing atmosphere. Wonderful service and food. You might want to make an earlier reservation so that you can stay there longer to enjoy everything! ,5
 Fabulous from the appetizers to desert. One of the best lunches I've ever had. The food and service were stellar ,5
 Overall dinning experience was fantastic. Waiter was friendly and knowledgeable. Restaurant was clean and the view was awesome. Food was fantastic. Appetizers were amazing. ,5
" A wondeful setting, good service, ono food, but an epic fail on desserts. ",4
 The restaurant is in a beautiful location with a fantastic view. Both food and service are good too. ,4
 Food was good but very over priced. Very noisy. Could not hear the waiter when he arrived at our table to recite the specials. Could not hear the conversation with my friend. No local people in the restaurant. Seems to be a tourist restaurant. Poorly designed. The marble tiled floor and the walls did nothing to quiet the reverberation sounds of all the patrons in the restaurant and other noises in the restaurant. Not a place for a quiet romantic dinner. ,2
 Food should be coming-in in a shorter interval. ,5
" The restaurant is in a dumpy-looking neighborhood (we passed by some homeless people's tents) but once you get there, the building looks very nice and the view of the ocean from the dining area is great. We liked the idea that appetizers and dessert were included in the meal. There was a variety of appetizers - however, there was only one choice for the dessert which was a chocolate cake with a small scoop of gelato. The dessert was kind of disappointing... I couldn't taste the caramel drip on the plate - it was kind of bland, and the gelato was hard as a rock when it was first served. I had to wait a few minutes for it to start melting. Otherwise, the entree and service were very good. ",4
" food &amp; service was excellent. liked the veal marsala better than the ""chicken parmagiana."" note, both were good but would have liked a thicker piece of chicken. only negative is they forgot to address my friend's birthday. when i made my reservations with open table, i made specific instruction that it was his birthday. the server did acknowledge it &amp; apologized but after i told him. overall, was pleased &amp; will come again. ",5
" It was first time for me. I and my friend went to lunch. The view is nice, their service is nice, food also nice. we had lunch in very relaxing mood. I'd like to go back soon again. ",4
 Very classy. Appetizers and dessert included with entree. ,5
" The restaurant is beautiful.I took a friend out to celebrate her recent retirement. We were seated at a love seat, which is probably much more appreciated by couples looking for a romantic experience. My friend sat in the love seat and I took a separate chair, which was sort of awkward. Diners should be asked if they want one of the love seats. There are plenty of other tables in the restaurant.  Service was not up to par with other high class restaurants. We had the hearts of romaine with caesar dressing (which I could barely taste). The server never offered fresh pepper for the salad and there were no salt and pepper shakers on the table. My friend said her steak was excellent. I would have preferred my ahi without sweet and sour sauce. ",3
" Overall, the quality of the restaurant was very good. The wait staff were great (very attentive), the food was very good and you couldn't beat the view (although it was a little cloudy that day).  I think that this restaurant could easily be rated an ""Excellent"", but I have particular expectations with my dining experiences and just this just didn't quite hit that ""magic"" element I was looking for.  Unfortunately, I don't really have any negative comments about the restaurant(other than it would have been nice to have been offered appetizers from the cart a second time around and since we were only one of 5 tables in the restaurant, it would have been nice to see the maitre d').  I would DEFINITELY go back again! ",4
" Terrific spot with convenient valet parking. Menu is priced reasonably - considering that every item is served fresh. The wine and cocktail menus are conservative in a good way - not intimidating or over-done at all. Service is noteworthy, with a very attentive staff that speaks with a much-appreciated candor in regards to selections. ",5
" Great atmosphere!!! Great view!!! Very romantic! In addition, the food and service were BOTH absolutely WONDERFUL!!! ",5
 The interior of the restaurant is extremely lavish. The service was very good and our waitress tried to provide the best service possible. However the fish dinner that we were looking forward to came very overcooked with very little flavour. We had to send it back because it was too dry to eat. It made our dining experience one that we would not recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for a good meal. We would have left without eating if we hadn't driven so far to get to this restaurant that came so highly recommended. All and all IT WAS A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. If you want a good meal go elsewhere. It is all about the decor not the food. ,2
" The restaurant is in a beautiful location with a fantastic view. The food was nothing to write home about. We own a private country club in Texas and our food would be as good as what we were served with half the cost. I know that you pay for view and also if there is a well known chef. The presentation of the food was very good, and the waitstaff did very good with his service. We would only recommend if you want a fantastic view and money is not an object. The decor is fantastic, but a little on the cold side. ",3
" This is the 2nd time we've been to 53 by the Sea...it was fantastic, again. We really love it, food is great and also the service is AWESOME! ",5
 Waitress was excellent. Food service was very slow but compensated with desserts. ,3
" This was our second visit, first time for dinner, second time for lunch. Menu was excellent for lunch, as was the special ""treat"" of appetizers and dessert that was included in the price. Attention to every detail was absolutely fantastic. Thank you 53 by the Sea. ",4
 Went for my one year anniversary - they made it truly an enjoyable experience! ,5
" Tables are not close each other, so we really enjoyed our dinner. Outstanding scenic view, lunch time must be more nicer.  Food was OK kind, the grilled opakapaka was too plain, needed help. The seafood trio appetizer was great.  The floor workers looked too busy walking around. ",4
 Awesome food and experience. We will be back soon! ,5
" Great environment, bathroom with seat warmer and toilet wash station ",5
" To be honest, I am disappointed at this restaurant because 1)there was no welcome feelings at the entrance at all. I have to open the heavy meal entrance door to get into ths building. I understand this restaurant is a part of wedding facility and so they do not care too much about the restaurant's guests, 2) this restaurant is not open air setting and located in a part of lobby area in a wedding facility. The valet parking service was fantastic. ",3
" Beautify facilty, well prepared portion control food &amp; excellent services. Notable wine list.  recommented: Seafood Showcase pairing with Sancerre wine. ",5
" Really enjoyed the food and the band. Had the Shrimp and grits and loved it. the band was tight, played songs from yesterday and today and overall made the place really fun. If you are going there to have a serious conversation, you may want to go when the band isn't there. ",5
 My husband and I were here for a church conference we needed something to eat and I went to open table. I checked out the ratings and read the reviews and we decided to try the restaurant. We had good food and great service the music was good also.  The only thing that I really didn't care for was the band fee that your charged. Other than that we enjoyed it. ,5
 Nice ambiance. Not too crowded on a Monday night. Tasty meal. ,4
" Was not happy with the band fee.. Food was not as good as it has been in the past,  however the band was nice.. ",3
 We had a wonderful time from the time we walked in to leaving. The band this evening was interactive and had us singing some great songs.  I enjoyed  seeing children along with our 15 yr old who were exposed to great music and actually knowing the words.  Smile on our faces the entire time.  We are already planning our second trip back with friends! ,5
 The atmosphere was wonderful ,4
" I had planned a romantic lunch with my husband, the food was very good but we were disappointed that the Live Entertainment did not show up for the assigned time of our  reservation. ",5
" I was very excited to finally try this place since its always been booked in advance. We were seated extremely close to another table (as they all are) and our waitress came after about 10-15min to say she will be right with us. It went downhill from here. 30 minutes later the hostess noticed we still had no service and offered to at least bring us water to get started (yes! I'm thirsty and starving at this point) 15 min later another waitress noticed we still had no service and offered to take care of us. Wish I remembered her name because she really took care of us once she took our order. We both had shrimp and grits that were awesome; the mac n cheese and fried green tomatoes, not so much...very over-seasoned to my liking. The fried green tomatoes were too salty/inedible/and made me drink my whole glass of . Luckily everything we didn't approve of was removed from our bill. By the way, the band did not show up which is one of the main reason I wanted to check this place out; however, we were not charged for that either. I think I came on a bad day. ",1
" Beautiful soulful atmosphere. Good  food, good music, great service.  This will be my new spot in Atlanta :-) ",5
 Looking for a spot to wind down and enjoy great jazz and excellent food look no further ,5
" This was our second trip to the Juke Joint. We visit Atlanta once a year for a trade show. After visiting the Juke Joint last year, we knew we wanted to go back!  Cliff was our server and he makes dining a special event! We enoyed the music, food and service! A definite must when visiting Atlanta! ",5
 the live band would be the only thing i would recommend. the food was aweful. the service was aweful. the drinks were aweful!!!! ,1
 A business associate and I enjoyed a great dinner and live music at Sweet Georgia's. We had the jambalaya pasta and ribs for entrees. Both were excellent. Nice cocktail and beer selection. The trio that entertained on a Monday night were very good. Can't wait to visit Atlanta again so we can enjoy Sweet Georgia's. ,5
" Loved the food, service and entertainment! ",5
" What a wonderful evening we spent at Sweet George's. Great soul food, but the special surprise was the entertainment. The singer and band made the place jump and the same time the volume was not over powering. What a great experience. ",5
" What an awesome experience! The food was good, our waitress was absolutely fabulous and the entertainment was phenomenal! ",5
 I did not like the fact we had to pay 5.00pp for an enterainment fee. ,4
" Thanks go out to the staff. We originally made the reservation for 6 people at 8PM. On the recommendation of the staff, we wanted to move the reservation to 7PM in order to see more of the show. In addition, we needed to add 4 more people. They were very accommodating.   Beverly ""Guitar"" Watkins was performing with her band. Great Show! She was phenomenal and the 12 year old young man who played a few songs on the drums was great also.   Finally, the food was great! Service was a bit slow on drinks but understandable given the crowd. ",5
 I have been to the Juke Joint several times for dinner and the food was amazing each time.  I finally went for Sunday Brunch and the food was very good and it seems to be the best time to go. You can get a reservation or walk right in.  The entertainment was not as lively as the bands at night and he was late. Plenty of $5 parking.  Overall  it was a great time. ,4
" The Sweet Georgia's Juke Joint is a great place to dine.  Our food came out hot and it was delicious.  Malika was our server and she was outstanding.  She was very attentive and knew exactly when to visit our table for refills and additional service.  We will definitely dine at Sweet Georgia's Juke Joint.  We will also, request Malika as our server. ",5
 I brought mister here fur his 47th birthday and he loved it. The food was delish except for the steak which was plenty but unseasoned &amp; tuff. The live entertainment was great as well as our waitress who was very knowledgeable &amp; gave us great customer service. We week definitely go back again ,4
" The server was one of the best I have encountered.  I was in the restaurant/bar industry for quite some time.  His level of professionalism, expertise for recommendations, and upselling techniques were impeccable. ",5
 Shrimp &amp; Grits; Gumbo; Salmon ,4
 This is a wonderful place to eat aline or with a group. The food  is exceptional. The service is grand and the entertainment  is sooooooooop good. All of this and great prices will make you want to go back three or four times a week. ,5
" This place was beyond my expectations. Our server Chris was the best server I have ever met in my lifetime of dining out. The recommendations were superb. The food was absolutely carefully prepared well presented. I had never eaten salmon until this day. We are more than pleased with the food, music and ambiance. We will definitely be back as a choice of dining. ",5
" I brought my father here for his birthday and he really enjoyed himself. The live entertainment was great, awesome waitress and the food is good. ",5
" The service was spectacular, ambiance was clean and warm. The only thing that dampened the experience was my steak was a tad overcooked and my girlfriend's salad vinigrete was to sweet ",4
" Decent fried chicken. Nothing special. The shrimp and grits were ok. There was liquid surrounding the grits and I didn't know if it was butter or excess water from cooking grits. Grits texture was firm and nice. 4 shrimp in the 24 dollar dish seemed a bit pricey for value. The Mac and cheese was slightly better than Kraft.   The crab cakes and deviled eggs were outstanding. This truly saved the meal.   Service was good. There was quite a bit of ""selling"" how great the food was there. Seemed to set you up to order stuff! But clearly we were disappointed with overall meal.  In summary, I heard a lot of great things about this place. The music was fantastic! The food was a dissapointment. Service was friendly. Not sure I'm a big advocate, but did enjoy the tunes. I would go for music and appetizers! ",3
" My sister and I came here for lunch last Friday. We made a reservation, but it wasn't needed, the place was practically empty. There were two wait staff on hand and a bartender.   We were seated immediately, however the wait staff took a moment to acknowledge us. The waitress was a sweetheart. She was very nice, suggested food to try. We ordered the rock shrimp and crab cake  appetizer, which was good. I ordered the fried chicken meal with fried green tomatos and Mac n cheese. My sister got the fish and chips. We both were not pleased with our entrees. My sides were good and I ended up sharing them with her because she was left with just fries. Her fish wasn't seasoned well. My chicken was seasoned well on the outside, but very bland on the inside.   Maybe we came on the wrong day. The service was slow, the food took a long time to come out. The staff were all really nice, it just felt like they were moving at a snail's pace. ",2
 great place for a birthday dinner with entertainment! ,4
 I have been several times but this time my food was not  very good ,3
" Great space for large groups.  Good food, good service, good atmosphere, equals a return visit! ",4
 The food was good and the music was perfect for a Sunday Brunch with family! ,5
" Had a great time. Live music 7 days a week, great food. ",5
" Great selection of Southern cuisine and live music began at 7 pm. Service was very good. Great trio (soloist, keyboards, drums) offered a selection of classics like ""My Girl"", ""Stand By Me,"" and others. ",4
 Really wanted to love this place but the food just was not what we hoped. Our server was really wonderful. The music was great. Those are the reasons to come. The food was just okay. Best was fried chicken. ,4
 Great location for a romantic dinner.  The food was good but the atmosphere and music was GREAT!  Would definitely recommend Sweet Georgia's.  In fact we plan to go back in the near future for a different act. ,5
 had so much fun dining here. terrific place to go to with a group of friends from out of town to enjoy Georgia at its best ,5
" Five colleagues and myself attended a conference last week in Atlanta and we decided to try this restaurant out. It was by far the best dining experience we had in town.  The food and beverages were delicious, and the band was outstanding.  It was hard to sit while eating, because we wanted to get up and groove.  Our waitress was so sweet and funny.  She photo bombed a few of our group shots, recommended drinks that were a big hit, and the menu items she suggested were simply fabulous.  I tried the fried green tomatoes, and grilled salmon.  I absolutely loved this dining experience.  If I ever get to return to Atlanta, this will be my first stop. ",5
" Great ambiance, live music, energetic wait staff.  Nice variety of food and cocktail  choices on the menu. ",5
 Poor Service!!!! Had to wait ten min. to get a waiter. Five dollars charge for entertainment is crazy. ,2
" The band was good, the food was good and the atmospher was great. I will definitely return! ",4
 The service was great and so was the food. Do not come here for a quiet romantic evening or a business discussion. Do come to get your groove on because you will not want to sit still. It's a Juke Joint for a reason. ,5
" Went with a group of technical people after a day of meetings. Was a fun environment after a long day of meetings. However, there was some problem at the bar. We waited nearly 1/2 hour to get 5 beers and 2 glass of wine. When the beers finally came they were in small glasses. The server later brought out a 1/2 pitcher of beer in a rather feable attempt to appease us. One of us almost jokingly told him it was embarassing, and he came back with a full pitcher. --Eventually he satisfied us, but service is need of improvment. Food was not all served at once either. The music was good tho, and some of us even got up to dance. ",3
" My husband and I were visiting Altanta and happened upon this restaurant. What a great find! It's a very cool restaurant offering live music and excellent food. We started with the mixed appetisers-fried green tomatoes, fried okra and fried vidalia onions. I had the e'touffe and my husband had the pork chops. It was all delicious. The only disappointment was the peach cobbler. It was undercooked, gooey and cold in the middle. If we ever come back to Atlanta, I would be sure to visit again! ",5
" Great food, friendly wait staff, fun music ",4
 We loved the Southern food. The atmosphere was terrific. ,5
" Live music, a beautiful array of people, and delicious food all make for a great evening in Sweet Georgia June Joint. Everything about this place is stellar and I always feel happy when I leave. ",4
" My first time here. The food was good but not great, the portions were quite substantial. The two of us had one cocktail each, dinner entrees with 2 sides included, and dessert for under $94 but I thought that was a bit much for comfort food. OUr server was attentive and pleasant, but he did not volunteer a dessert menu..we had to request. The music was very good, but too loud for the size of the restaurant..we couldn't talk to one another without yelling..not sure if there was any seating away from the noise. The ambiance is cozy and the restaurant is set in a good location. The valet parking was convenient but pricey.Be prepared to pay the $10 fee up front. I would have preferred to self-park but couldn't find it easily. ",4
" The ribs may need another sauce, the salmon was a little dry. The service was poor and unfriendly.. I waited for months to come to this restaurant only be disappointed. I will be in no hurry to attend again.. Maybe because it was Sunday, however it was slow aroung 5pm and you would think the waitress would be more attentative. ",3
" This was an excellent dining experience, the food was great and they had a jazz band. My friend was celebrating her 50th birthday and the manager gave us complimentary sots of moonshine...very nice! ",5
" Music was great - food was not, so so at best. The fried chicken was greasy. Server was friendly but not attentive enough.  With the right entertainment, this could be a fun spot but the food is not special. ",2
" LOVED it! Great food, great music, great service. Will go back!! ",5
" Love the dining experience at the Junk Joint! This was my second time dining there and the only thing I missed was the band. If the only music playing is from the junk joint radio and the playlist was not that good. Please bring back just regular mac and cheese, did not care of the change. Also, if the band is not performing you may want to play music videos on the screen. Food and drinks were great!!! Love the Blueberry Moonshine Cocktail... ",5
 first experience and really enjoyed the service. friend from out of town accompanied me and she enjoyed it as well I will definitely come back. this time I will make reservations on a Saturday or Friday night... the staff was very friendly ,4
 Lots of entertainment and great food! ,4
 I wish we had one where I live; I would be a regular! ,5
" Our waiter Mr Robert was most professional, curious and hospitable. His knowledge of the menu was most helpful. Our experience at Sweet Georgia was a most delightful and memorable one. We will always cherish the memories of sharing our 27th wedding anniversary at Sweet Georgia's. ",5
" This is a nice place to take in some reasonably priced good food, and relaxing Real Jazz. The service was somewhat slow, but the hospitality was warm and friendly. ",2
" It was my first and will not be my last visit to Sweet Ga's Juke Joint. I am from Baltimore, Maryland and was in Atlanta over the Labor Day weekend. I tried to visit your restaurant last year in September when I was in Atlanta, but it was full. So, I made reservations months in advance to ensure I would get in....and it was well worth it!!! I loved the atmosphere, the service, the food and especially the live entertainment! A great experience!!!!! ",5
 The service was terrible. Had to ask a different waitress three times for help because ours was MIA. It was lunch time and it took 45 minutes to get our food and it was clear it had been under the heat lamps a while. ,2
 Great spot for true southern food. Went on a night with live music. It was great. Will definitely be going back. ,4
 The food was fantastic. Our server was not attentive to our needs. I am not sure if the establishment was short staffed or if the server was just inexperienced. I would go back for the food. ,3
" I took my boyfriend here for his birthday and he did not enjoy it. We went on a Monday evening, it was not busy but we still waited a very long time for service at out table. We ordered an appetizer and it was cold. By the time our server brought us a warmer one, our meals were already out. I can say that the macaroni-n-cheese and the sauteed spinach was good. Other than that, don't think that we will go back. ",2
 I was expecting more of a selection from the menu. I was a little disappointed. ,3
 Always a nice place for good food and entertainment! ,5
" I went to the Juke Joint with a group as a girls night out. We had loads of fun. The food was yummy, the drinks were good (strong) but good! Our waitress, who I believe was name Franki (female) was very nice and vibrant! And the band, Gritz &amp; Jelly Butter, were awesome! The atmosphere was energetic and fun. We had a wonderful time. Word of advice, definitely make reservations in advance or the wait is about 1.5 hours or more. Glad we used opentable to reserve our spot. Fun, Fun, Fun! ",5
" My friends and I had an awesome time!! The restaurant and ambiance is outstanding! We were celebrating my friend's decision to go back to school for her Ph.D and everyone had a fabulous evening. The food was excellent and our waitress, Simret, was very polite, attentive, and so on point with servicing our group. Great customer service!! The band, The Soul Cartel, was wonderful. Everyone in my party raved about what a great evening they had. This was our first visit and we will definitely come again and again!! ",5
 The food is nasty. Canned greens. Yuk... Abnormally large and dark fried chicken. The brisket was drowned in BBQ sauce. ,2
" I've been to Sweet Georgia's Juke Joint on a couple different occasions and have never had a bad experience. The food is great! The drinks are great and the bands are awesome! It's a great place for inexpensive but fabulous southern cuisine. The service is always good! Nice place for brunch, date night or just hanging with good friends!!! ",5
 This place never disappoints. The wait staff is always on point; though I would like to see some newer items on the menu. The music is what makes this place truly special. I have never heard a bad musician/band. ,4
" This was our first visit to Sweet Georgia's Juke Joint. We were celebrating our 32nd wedding anniversary and wanted a memorable place for dinner. We were seated a a small table that was on the wall with seating too close I felt to the next diners. We enjoyed the entertainment but it was too loud to engage in any meaningful conversation. We were not aware, either that there 2was $5.00 per person entertainment fee added to our bill. We thought the entertainment was a part of the evening. ",4
 Overall I had a great time the band was fabulous. The hotess at the front desk was not so great. The food was alright nothing to brag about. It was very hard to hear when talking and felt like I was shouting when talking. It was very noisy. ,3
 Always like this restaurant. Didn't know they closed at 10pm on Sundays. They didn't have any live music. ,4
" The atomosphere and staff was wonderful,we came to see our friend Regina Troupe sing and really enjoed ourselves. ",5
" We really enjoyed it! I was a little concerned after reading other reviews, as they either rated it as great or terrible due to service issues. But all 4 of us loved it. The staff was uniformly professional and courteous, and our server, Darrell, was terrific. Service was prompt, food and drinks were good, and the music was great. I'd definitely recommend making a reservation -- we were there on a Wednesday, and the place was hopping. ",4
 Southern comfort food done right. For dessert don't choose between the peach cobbler and pecan pie get them both! ,5
" Exactly as expected. Great music, energy and visual entertainment. ",4
" This was our 2nd time to visit The Juke Joint. The 1st was a much better experience. The second Time our service was lacking. Our food was brought out hot But we had no silverware and it took her 10-15 min to bring it, by Then our food was getting cold. We had to catch her on the run To ask for drink refills, it would then take 10-15 min for her to get Back with us. I will still go back and just hope that we get a different Waiter. Perhaps the one we had the 1st nite. He kept our drinks refilled Without us even having to ask and basically did that with everything Else you could think of. The food and atmosphere is great, the service is The only complaint I have. ",4
" Poor service, good music; Food that was brought on time was good, other food was cold Waitress not attentive ",2
" Excellent, fresh, locally produced and delicious food. Excellent service,  very nice local wine choices and lovely restaurant. The best option in the entire area! ",5
" very good food, very good seasonal menu. very nice local wine list-reasonable. service was very attentive, excellent. ",5
" We came to this restaurant with friends to buy them dinner and were surprised at the cost of the meal.  There were many fruit flies around the food as it was served and we had to keep cocktail napkins over our wine glasses.  The waitress explained that the grape harvest season always brings the fruit flies, but we did not encounter those elsewhere. The food was fine, but not special and the atmosphere was somewhat bare.  To be fair, the weather was awful and the view was obscured by the rain and fog.  I would suggest that the restaurant have some way of cozying up the ambiance in times of bad weather or for evening.  We could tell that their emphasis is on summer dining with a huge veranda.  Our waitress was very nice, but we asked for one water without ice and had to remind her twice before she delivered it as we were finishing up.  Little things make a difference. ",3
" Wonderful experience, service, and food. ",5
 Service was way too slow . Food was good and you can see lake from the dining place ,3
 Outstanding view of vineyards cascading down to Lake Seneca while dining outside on the large covered deck.  Abeautiful venue with great service and good food.  Wonderful ambience. ,5
 Went there to celebrate our anniversary.  It is expensive and the portions were tiny.  But the food and service were very good.  The view was outstanding.  Great view of Seneca Lake.  Very nice deck overlooking the grounds.  Very pretty place. ,4
" The food and service were good.  Unfortunately, there was a wedding at the winery that day so we had to eat lunch in a wine cellar area instead of outside.  Would go back in hopes of sitting outside and enjoying the great view of the lake. ",3
" Tofu tacos and pulled pork were excellent, modest portions, great view of the lake, friendly staff ",5
 The food was excellent. Chicken was not overcooked or dry. Our desert was outstanding.  Enjoyed the outdoor eating experience with a view of the valley and Seneca Lake. ,5
 This was my first time visiting the restaurant. I had an amazing time. The ambiance was AMAZING. The food was great. And the band was the bomb. Great date night spot...will be recommending this place to friends and family. And I'll definitely be back :)) ,5
" Being my first time I found it really pleasurable. The atmosphere was the kind of thing that you can have a good time. We are looking forward to returning in the future. The food was excellent, the service impeccable, I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a good place to dine. Can't wait for the next visit. ",4
" There is a cover charge of $5 for each person at your table if you dine on Thursday, Friday or Saturday. ",3
" Loud, noisy, vibrant and fun. Don't come here for a quiet, relax with a glass of wine kind of meal. For as busy as the restaurant was while we were there, we had top notch service and our large table of guests enjoyed themselves. We did not expect haute cuisine. And we were pleasantly surprised by very enjoyable, well presented tasty food. It was as busy as all get out and management went out of their way to check numerous times that our meal was going well. Would we go back? POSITIVELY especially if we were in party frame of mind. ",3
" Don't go without a reservation and if you arrive more than 15 minutes late for your reservation they will not seat you. Moonshine happy hour drinks were wonderful. Great service from staff, but food arrives slowly. ",4
" This is a great spot that can be frequented 1 or more times per week and you'll never have the same experience. The ambiance is awesome staff makes you feel like you're in a house party from back in the day. The bands are off the chain, this past Wednesday the audience was in participation of the young lady singing and it was great!!! My first visit was an invite to afternoon drinks with girlfriends and I've returned again, and again...... You can come alone, on a date or with friends and always have an enjoyable time. ",5
" The music and the moonshine are the main reasons to go to this restaurant, particularly if Mike Jones is entertaining on his sax the night you go - there is simply no better musician in the world! Our service was outstanding, although the recommendation would be for smaller groups as opposed to large groups, as the entire restaurant seems a bit flustered when 6+ enter through the doors. The shrimp and grits was the best entree (we tried them all), and the fried green tomatoes on the sampler starter were to die for. Will definitely be back! ",4
 Very Enjoyable southern cuisine. Live music during lunch was a pleasant surprise. Will return to see what dinner is like. Great location - convenient to the Peachtree Center Station - either exit puts you steps from the restaurant door. ,4
 Loved the food and the live band was great! ,4
 Went to Sweet Georgia Juke Joint for 15th wedding anniversary dinner &amp; entertainment. We had a great time. Only complaint is I felt like we were far apart from one another. The tables alongside the wall are long which created a lot of space so it felt less intimate &amp; with it being loud it added to the space between us. But the food was EXCELLENT and the band was really good. A good spot but maybe not for a romantic evening out. ,4
" The four of us loved the atmosphere, live entertainment, food and service. The decor was urban chic and tastfully done. We definitely plan to return again in the near future. ",4
 Nice expeience great entertainment ,4
" The food was very good. The entertainment was good, but not as good as thought it was going to be. The service was a little disappointing. ",3
 It was a girls night out and it was so upbeat and fun!! I would recommend it for a girls night or date night. The band was wonderful and entertaining. THREE THUMBS UP!!! ,5
 Great food. Great jazz. Great way to spend our Friday night. We loved Sweet Georgia's. Toni Byrd was awesome!! ,5
 Great for girls night out or date night! Be sure to make reservations if your going on Friday or Saturday night! ,4
" Great food, service was pretty bad ",4
" Food was OK. I did not like where we were seated. The service was very bad - spotty, slow and then we had to wait more than 30 minutes just to get our check. ",3
" good food, bartender and bar service slow and very slow Waiter was wonderful but in a bad spot regarding drinks if the bar service was better, I would have given it at least 1 more star if not 2 ",3
" It was my first visit, I ordered the rack of lamb..I wanted it well done and the waiter talked me out of getting well done and I went with his recommendation of medium well...needless to say there was blood all over the plate..I ended up eating my collard greens and potatos. Everything else was wonderful. If you know how you like your meat stick to your guns about it. The manager did refund half my money for the rack of lamb. ",4
 I took my mom on monday and she totally enjoyed her self. ,4
" This is a great spot for girls night or an intimate dinner. The food was delicious and the entertainment added a nice touch; however, I was not aware of the $5.00 entertanment fee during dinner prior to arriving at he restaurant. ",5
" Took my best friend for her birthday celebration! The ambiance and the food were a HIT!ONE CONCERN: Due to the lighting (dark/romantic)I was not able to clearly see the fine print on the veeeeeeerrrrrrrr bottom of the menu I will say that the small print; on the menu in regards to the $5 per person entertainment fee was a JOKE! Didn't even see it at the verrrrrrrrrrrry bottom of the menu in small print. Ummm..so the extra charge to my bill way VERY CLEAR, other than that...I WAS A GOOD OLE JUKE JOINT TIME! ",4
" We had a great time. the food was good and the service was nice. Our waiter was around when needed, but was not over bearing. The atmosphere was good and the live entertainment was very good. If you like rythem and Blues along with good southern style food, this a great choice. Its a little loud, but that is to be expected with a live band. ",4
" I had a great dinner party for 14 here. The service was a little slow and every time we asked for extra side plates it took forever to get them. When my guests told our waiter it was my birthday they got a slice of cake for me. Well they restaurant put he cake on my receipt. After one my friends told them about it they did take it off. Overall, the food was outstanding! The band was awesome! I would definitely go back if I am ever in Atlanta again. ",4
" Great Music, especially for a week night. ",4
 The food is good but it should be made clear what is considered a show and qualifies for the $5 per person fee when a reservation is made. I made reservations for 6:45 on a Sunday and the website said the show was at 5 so naturally I thought the set would be over and so there would be no show fee but when I got the bill that was a different story and I didn't argue it because it was father's day and I wanted to just keep the meal nice. I probably will not be back any time soon if at all as this added $30 to our bill which seemed crazy. ,2
 I enjoyed the brunch on Father's Day. My fiancee and I both had the chicken and waffles. The waffles by far was the best I have EVER had! It was a bit too loud for my taste for brunch with the live band but the noise wouldn't have been a problem for an evening with friends. Would like to come back on a night when romance is in the air. Overall I give it 5 stars. Drinks are pricey but the food is priced well. ,5
" I did not enjoy the female singer on Saturday, June 16th. Overall a great place for an evening out ",5
" I was not pleased from the moment we walked in. The hostess was not friendly and forgot our name, did not make us feel like welcomed. Our server Electra was OK but kept forgetting to bring us items we had requested, however she was friendly.Food, on the Southern Starter appetizer, the okra was cold and the tomatoes were hot. Our entrees, Shrimp and grits / Catfish and grits - grits were instant and the shrimp had no seasoning, no flavor, shrimp taste like it was just boiled and sat on top of the grits. Lastly, when we left, the hostess did not thank us for coming nor did we get a good bye. ",2
" Rules about how long a customer can stay is too strict. One additional person who was unexpected showed up for our party and the establish was unwilling to accommodate citing no tables, but the tables never filled. ",4
" I took my friends visiting from one of the Caribbean Islands and they fully enjoyed the ambiance, food, music and adult crowd. I recommend Juke Joint to anyone looking for mature music filled relaxed entertainment. ",4
" Arrived at the end of the brunch service. Enjoyed the jazz band - not too loud - as well as my meal. Had the shrimp &amp; crab cake with brunch potatoes and loved it. The three cakes were moist &amp; tasty and the portion was more than enough. Enjoyed the sweet potatoe pie for dessert - crust was flaky and the filling was sweet like I like it! Hubby had turkey club - said ingredients were very fresh, making a delicious sandwich. We'll go back! ",5
" Truly a good find, food, service and live entertainment was excellent. Hope to visit again soon. ",5
 Great place for food and entertainment ,4
 Great atmosphere and good music too!! ,4
 I love this place. The live music is great! I love taking new people to this place so that they can have a new place to go to. ,5
" The band, Something for the Soul was splendid! The food was delectable! Miss Celie's Punch was great. Our server was phenomenal. Several managers/owners stopped by our table, introduced themselves and shook our hands! Exceptional Customer Service! We were celebrating our 6th Wedding Anniversary. We will be returning! ",5
" This is the perfect place to go for a night out with your girlfriends! There's lots of yummy food, good drinks, and great live entertainment. The food is upscale soul food with a few interesting twists. Some of the drinks are made with real moonshine, they're really tasty, but pack a big kick. ",4
" Food was fair, sides were not good, service was lacking. Nice for music. ",3
" It was my son's 19th Birthday and he picked Kelsey's as he had just been to the one in Brockville and had the Doritos crusted chicken fingers. Upon arrival greeted warmly and shown to our table. When we started looking through menus we all agreed that the print was pretty small on the menu, and on top of that lighting above had been removed and changed to red bulbs to ""set the mood"" we were told. When we did mention about the lighting the manager did pop over and mention they carry braille menus....um...what? Lol She then explained she had a larger print menu as well. 2 orders were fish and chips and  the rest of the orders were  a chicken ceaser salad a mac and cheese and  an award winning burger. My son was pretty dissapointed as in Brockville the pieces were much larger (dorito crusted chicken)and came with a variety of dipping sauces one being peanut butter which he loved this did not have the same . The fish and chips were both soggy from the cole slaw on the plate and were barely warm  by the time served, they also said it was way to much batter to fish ratio . I really did not like the sauce on the ceaser salad so basically left the salad and ate the pieces of chicken. The mac and cheese was a hit along with the burger so 2 of the 6 meals ordered.  The staff were great and the manager comped my sons dessert and gave him a ""hands free"" bday shot which was appreciated. I will return only for the appetizer of 4 cheese spinach dip and their sangria pitchers in the summer but I am afraid it will not be a place to choose for dinner out anytime soon. ",2
" My husbands food was cold when it brought out, took a long time to get our food. ",3
" I know the food is good, just made a bad choice that day.  Server was rather cold until he brought the bills to the table, then very friendly.  Had to ask twice for glass of water.  Tipped him anyway.  Hey, its Christmas.  Had a great time visiting with friends.  Made reservation on line, but restaurant had no record of it, even though it said it was successfully submitted.  Did not have to wait though. ",3
 The food was good and the service quick and pleasantly done. ,4
 Very noisy. Service ok but slow to bring the bill once meal was complete. ,3
 Wing night ,4
" I loved having birthday dinner with my dad. Food was great Kingston Location Nicole waitress AWESOME! However I booked  a reservation the other day online, and did not realize being classed as a beginner in anything cyber related that i would be bombarded with emails i cannot seem to unsubscribe from. Please remove me. Im a lady of limited means and if i am lucky after saving all year I may eat out once. So i find these completly unnecessary and a waste of time.  Ty in advance. Take me off your email list asap  please. I would greatly appreciate it... Tammy Bedder squab65@yahoo.ca ",5
 I picked up my wife after her shift ended and surprised her wirh dinner and a movie to celebrate her life goals she just achieved this past week. Everyone was very nice and didn't make us feel rushed to order. Drinks were great she loved the recommended big momma. I love the bison burger and she loved the chicken parmesan. ,5
 Our server was incredible! The food was amazing. ,5
" I went with my Japanese customer for lunch. I was sure they would love it and they did. Really enjoyed service, food, view and atmosphere of the restaurant. They said good cost performance. ",5
" Weather was not cooperative, overcast and rainy. I opted for the soup of the day, Minestrone. For $12.00 it came to a $1.00 a spoonful, barely enough to savor a taste. I don't mind spending money for an excellent dinner but half filled bowls leaves one wanting. Since they were already out of the Ranchers Prime Rib (at 6:30PM) I had the Filet with the Cabernet wine reduction. I was pleased with my choice. As a side I ordered the Homemade French fries. Bad decision. They were awful. Nothing but overdone dry potato wedges of which there were too many. Skimp on the potatoes and offer more soup. My companion had mahimahi which she said was good. We had 3 nights in Honolulu and all three dinners we had left a lot to be desired. ",3
" Excellent service, food was very good , I will be coming back &amp; letting all my friends know about 53 by the sea. ",5
 Highly recommend this restaurant! ,5
" The food was delicious. Escargots were exotic but a little on the salty side. A little less salt and it would have been perfect. The calamari salad was very nice, grilled calamari would have been better than battered ones. The vegetable linguini was very nice, almost perfect. The spaghetti Bolognese was very rich but delicious all the same. The service was first class. The view was fantastic. Overall, a very pleasant experience. Definitely will revisit with friends or for special occasions. ",5
" Took Mainland relatives for lunch. Makes a terrific impression, especially for visitors familiar with Honolulu, because this is a new, special place to dine. Jimbo (server) was very attentive and friendly. We ordered some new things this time and were surprised and very pleased. ",5
 Awesome setting for a delicious dinner and fine wine with dear friends. Beautiful evening view of Waikiki. Enjoyed our dining experience at 53 by the Sea.... ,4
 Not as good as Michaels and Hys. ,4
 A very special restaurant that locals should celebrate special occasions and business people should not miss. ,4
" Food below average, service good,very pricey,noisy, would not go back. ",1
" While dinner can be quite pricey, their lunches are quite reasonable. Entree selections automatically include appetizers and dessert and seem to average around $20. The views of Diamond Head and Kewalo are spectacular, and the tables are optimized to take advantage of this. ",4
" Three tries and I cannot say I will be back, except for happy hour to show out of town guests the view. The seafood pasta (like spaghetti) tasted reheated from lunch, dry without flavor, and not much in the way of seafood. On a previous visit a friend ordered this for lunch and it looked and tasted freshly made, so after two more times ordering it at dinner with the same result, I would not order it again. The filet my husband had looked overdone and when he complained they brought it back and said it was because of the tinted windows, so he ate it without further fuss. The manager came over and asked if everything was alright and reexplained about tinted windows. My husband said it still tasted overdone. ",2
" What a wonderful experience. Our expectations were high and they managed to exceed them! Congratulations. A definite ""must-return"" restaurant. Can't say enough good things about it... Gene Vosberg ",5
" 33rd anniversary. Prix fixe lunch quite tasty (we're foodies) and a bargain. The ""Happy 33rd Anniversary"" dessert plate written chocolate, including a drawing of Diamond Head, was a lovely touch. Cozy side-by-side seating in a booth with a beautiful view looking out toward Waikiki and Diamond Head. What a gorgeous view! ",4
" Food was good, nothing outstanding or exciting.  Service was professional but lacking. Servers seen to be jumping from table to table with a predetermined script. I could hear the server using the same examples in the same tones over a handful of times. Water cups we're not always refilled without asking.  Was a bit noisy. Love music was playing.  Went out of a birthday dinner and was disappointed to find out a complementary dessert was given after we placed an order. ",4
" Our dining experience was rather disappointing primarily due to the lack of professionalism by our waiter. He spilled water on my purse because he did not bother to have a towel to wipe the pitcher and when it was pointed out to him, he did not bother to apologize nor acknowledge his mistake. The appetizers were quite disappointing; I would have prefered to get a salad instead. When the waiter brought us the bill, he had a iron in his left hand that he had used to iron the table cloth on the table next to us. I thought this was rather tacky. ",2

 A gem located in Kakaako and who knew? I've been coming to Hawaii for over 50 years and certainly didn't. We'll be back! ,5
" What a beautiful experience! The food, service, and ambiance was excellent. ",5
" Trio for lunch, weather great, seated at a requested window table, view spectacular...but, food terribly disappointing. Limited menu is all right (after all it's lunch) if the dishes were satisifactory. I'm told that restaurant will have a new menu soon. Great news. We felt that emphasis on presentation bordered on the ridiculous; its miniscule portions in the appetizer and dessert dishes could all be collected and downed in one dainty swoop.  Two of us had the chicken parmesan; both had the same round shape but one was way larger than the other?? Mine was chewy and rather dry.  I had dinner with my family (4 of us) in January and all felt that Diamond Head was commanding, the food average. ",3
 Quality of pasta dishes was very good. Fish was very good.Problem was long wait before main dishes arrived. ,4
" Awesome meal,! excellent server, she was very attentive,-We went for our Anniversary, last month, but, will be back soon! ",5
 The food was good not great but the views of the ocean and Diamond Head were worth having lunch there. Service was exceptional. Nice place for lunch or to celebrate a special occassion. ,4
" Awesome gem! Food was outstanding. Great value, good portion. Ambience is amazing. We will definitely return. ",5
" Our first dining experience here was a very enjoyable evening. Food and service were very good. The shared mixed-seafood appetizer was a pleasant surprise...very fresh, nicely prepared and ample portions. While the restaurant orientation does not provide sunset views, the views toward Waikiki and Diamond Head are terrific! ",4
 We loved this place. The lunch prices were excellent for the quality of the food. We will definitely visit this place again. The view was wonderful. Service was excellent and the space was quite lovely. ,5
" My first visit was more enjoyable -- friendly server, appetizer cart with ample servings, relaxed timing Second visit -- was disappointed with the teeny appetizer serving and the selection o breads. Entree also looked a bit smaller than previously. Server looked and addressed only my guest, totally ignored me other than taking my order. I felt rushed with the server removing items and checking for payment. Previous server had a more hospitable pace. ",3
" Did not find the menu to have a variety of choices. very limited! Taste of food was average! Nothing wow ! Great view! Relaxing! Service was excellent! Wouldn't go back for food, but for the ambiance! ",3
" This is my second time. My husband and I had dinner a few months ago, and it was very nice. I thought I should try the lunch this time. The kitchen was very busy and the server offered us a cup of soup while waiting. The pasta was stuck together, which I did not like, but the source was good. I prefer stronger coffee, but I liked the warm milk served. ",4
" Beautiful decor, very good service. Filet mignon was excellent. Seafood pasta a little too al dente for my taste. They were changing the menu to reflect the new chef. Would like to dine again to see. ",4
 I and a friend of mine went there to celebrate my birthday--but when the reservation was made I did nto tell them. My friend (while I went to get something out of the car) did just that.  Any how the waitors name was Davin--outstanding. Pleasant --very professionlly dressed--nice sense of humor and a great smile and personality. He had all the right answers for all the questions both for myself and my friend asked--oh this was our first time here. The service was great--the food from the appetizers and on was terrific--My compliments to the chef for the delicious salmon that he or she prepaid--I am a salmon persona nd believe me this was spectacular--it just melted in your mouth--Great view--Great all a around ,5
 Unfortunately food is mediocre. Service wasn't good. The waitress hardly came to check on us. ,2
" Great venue, view, setup, lunch cuisine and wine list, although the wine markup is rather high. Also have heard from friends mixed reviews of their evening dining experiences. That said, the food, wine, setting, view and service for lunch there was of very high quality, and I would recommend it and go back for lunch any time. ",5
" Beautiful surroundings, atmosphere, very impressive...excellent service! ",5
" Our main waiter was great. The side-by-side seating was unusual, but pleasant, but a little uncomfortable if you are short like us (I'd rather have a regular chair than a loveseat). The food was good but not great- I found it to be lacking in flavor and added salt. I'd been to the Pineapple Room the day before and did not feel the need to add flavor to anything. The overall ambiance and experience was great.  I think the food should be great to match the whole experience. I think that there is a trend to have healthier/simpler fine dining, but for that kind of $ I want flavor. I do believe you can do both, but in this case it was lacking. ",4
" The quality of the food was excellent but kitchen service was extremely slow, but not for every table. There were long stretches of time spent waiting for every course, esp. the dessert and only two of our four diners had dessert. Considering the fact that the place was not filled and the prices are significant, two and a half + hours for dinner is not acceptable and the food was not good enough for me to consider returning.  I would recommend only if time is not valuable to you and you are willing to pay a higher price for food that you can get at other restaurants like Hy's and Morton's where such dishes can be had at a lower price and with much better kitchen service. You are paying extra for the view.  our servers were excellent ",3
" A must do when in Honolulu. Excellent food &amp; ambiance.. Excellent &amp; pleasant customer oriented service- White gloves- wow, its been a while since i have seen that...highly recommend this fine dining establishment. My daughters felt ""first class"" with the treatment we got. ",5
" Arrived on time, seated proptly. We had the worst table, as it was right in front of the kitchen door! Other tables were taken or reserved. It you go, please request any table but by the kitchen. Food, service was excellent. ",3
" It was a memorable and awesome dining experience for my wife and me. It was her birthday and we were treated so wonderfully! We will always remember the evening and will look forward to many more at your restaurant. Becky treated us like royalty, she is a gem. The food was delicious and the presentation was unique. Thank you for the excellent evening! ",5
" It was our first visit &amp; we are ready for our dinner on our next visit. Mahalo's for making it a very special occasion for us. The meal, food &amp; service was excellent...not to mention my seating request with a great view. Mahalo .:-) ",5
" Upon entering the restaurant, there was a sign by the register stating that there would be an automatic $5 performance fee added to the bill for each person during DINNER. We made a reservation for brunch on Sunday at 12:15pm. (We went there because it was conveniently across the street from the Ritz Carlton, where we were staying for a wedding the day before.) This is not dinner time. The $5 fee was added to our bills for each person. When we informed the waitress about the mistake on our bill, she said it's added automatically and she didn't know about any sign at the front. Basically, she had no control over it and wasn't planning on following up on it for us. We asked to speak to a manager. We showed her the sign and all she did was take the sign down. There was no apology for the confusion and no refund for the false advertising. The food was just ok and the service wasn't so great. Two of the people at our table had to ask for water and I had to ask twice for hot sauce because the waitress disappeared and never came back to check on us until the two additional people came to our table. She came to take their order but never actually checked on the rest of us. She came back to the table twice before I had to ask for the hot sauce a second time. I was almost done with my meal before she came back with the hot sauce and water. Needless to say, I will NEVER return and will be spreading the word to friends and family not to go as well. ",2
" It was an amazing experience.   The music, food and service were excellent.  Highly recommended this business! ",5
" I had a great time  celebrating my 50th birthday, Food and entertainment was excellent. I am looking forward to coming back. ",4
" I have been to the Juke Joint on numerous occasions and have had a wonderful time on every visit. The atmosphere is upscale, though the environment is welcoming to all.  The staff are very knowledgeable and focused on providing a positive customer experience.  Last night, our waitress was a true gem; she was engaging without being intrusive and was on top of our needs throughout the night.  This was all performed during what seemed like the most hectic period of the evening.  I love it when you can see a genuine aura of camaraderie and teamness!  Way to go staff!  I will be back! ",5
 Great service.  Food was not over seasoned.  Thank goodness! ,4
" I truly enjoyed bringing my girlfriend to Sweet Georgia for her birthday brunch. Even with a reservation the wait wasn't long. Like It may have been 10 minute past the reservation time.  Even when they told me that we didn't have anymore waffle for what I ordered, when I looked up, waffles were sitting in front of me. It was not my first visit and it will not be my last. ",5
 Shrimp was all the way cooked in shrimp and grits order. Also they charged us for entertainment on our bill and guy only played 20 min and his set ended ,3
" The eight of us who dined together all concurred - the food was fantastic!  That doesn't always happen when you are getting live music at the same time.  Our server was attentive and made recommendations for meal choices that were wonderful.  The blackened salmon, his favorite, was done perfectly. The jambalaya pasta had just the right amount of heat to satisfy. The shrimp with Parmesan grits were delicious!     The music was great! And the decibel level wasn't so high that we couldn't enjoy our conversation.  All in all, it was a great experience. ",5
" I have visited the 4 times over the past four years. It has gone down further each time. First time was good, maybe it was my company. Second time, I saw the drop off in service and quality of food. Third time, once the bartender realized I was in the business, she asked me if I was hiring. and this last time...Well...Lets just say, I was deeply disappointed. Not sure if I'll be back. ",1
" My girlfriend and I went here for our anniversary.  It was spectacular.  The food was delicious,  the staff was very friendly and the entertainment was next to none. We will definitely be coming back. ",5
" I loved the ambiance of this place. Heard about it from a friend that stumbled upon it while visiting Atlanta, and now I am telling all my friends about it. ",5
" The order I received was very greasy.  Oil was drsining on my plate.  No comp offered.  I HAD to order another an entree instead.  If the first was bad, why would I want to be subjected mandatory to another!?!?  Trifling policy.....very disturbing.  I will not be back.  I will not suggest this establishment to others. ",3
 The band was great as well as the live band experience.  The food on the other hands needs improving. Especially with this being a southern style restaurant in the south. The food lacked flavor and originality.  You would think the Juke joint would have some down home cooking. ,4
" this is a nice place for a group. the setting is nice but seating is not very personable for a romantic setting. the food was ok, I ordered chicken waffles. the waffles were very good. my fiance had steak and eggs with a side of grits, the grits were a bit dry and lacking in taste. I was told by friends that the evening ambience and food are much better....i will return during that time. however, it has been very difficult to get an evening reservation on a friday or saturday. ",3
" This was my second time to this restaurant, and I was there to help a friend celebrate her birthday.  The food was EXCELLENT and that was the saving grace for this visit.  Our server introduced herself to us and told us that this was her first job as a server - and it quickly became obvious that this was the case, but since she'd told us that upfront, my friend and I were willing to overlook 1) her slowness, even though initially the restaurant was not full; and 2) the fact that she did not get our orders exactly right (in fact, I had to send my order back because she brought me a dish I could not eat due to my personal dietary restrictions.)  All of that would have been fine, BUT in the middle of our brunch, the manager - without consulting us and without informing us and without our complaining - just decided to change our server and the new server came over, did not introduce herself and just started clearing our table and asking us if we wanted one or two checks - she was just so rude and intrusive that I just asked her, point blank, was she trying to rush us out of the restaurant.  It totally changed the vibe of our visit to the restaurant, and put a bad taste in both of our mouths.  As the restaurant got more crowded, we noticed that service was slower and slower.  We had issues with parking validation. Also, even though I mentioned that we were there to celebrate a birthday, it was not acknowledged in any way.  (When I celebrated my birthday in Nov 2014, the musician sang Happy Birthday to me - it made my visit there very special)  I wish I could say the same for my friend's birthday celebration.  It just was not a totally enjoyable experience.  Again, if it had not been for the really good food (and the peach Ms. Cellie's), our brunch would have been a disaster.  We both agreed that we would try the restaurant again, but they would have to step up their game when it comes to service. ",4
 I would only recommend this place for the wine and atmosphere.late-night spot only. ,3
" I brought my husband here as a pre-Christmas dinner treat. First thing was that I felt was that the seating choice was way to close to other guest. Initially my husband was sitting across from me but the music was so loud we couldn't hear each other. So we had to turn the table so that he could sit next to me and luckily the other couple next to us were happy to scoot down a bit. Next the server was average, but made only a few visits to our table. Our entrees came out before our appetizer. The fried craw-fish appetizer was great! Our entrees were just ok. Greens were over cooked and the grits were not as creamy as they should have been. Then there is the $5 per person entertainment fee. With drink starting at $10 and appetizers starting at $12, I think its a bit ridiculous to charge an additional $5 per person. Especially when over half the time we were there the band was not playing. ",2
 My food was great my husband steak was very dry and he ordered med rare the server didn't fix it for him it was also tough the wings and crayfish tail were awesome we had to ask for refills We were seated in the back at first I told her we had reservations and wanted to be closer she sort of got snappy since it was a gift for our wedding we stayed the only way I would come back would be for the food the service need some improvement and we spent almost $200.00 if not more ,3
" Although this was my first visit for lunch, I have visited once in the past for a large group dinner on a Saturday night.  We truly enjoyed the food, the live band, the drinks and the fact you are NOT rushed to finish your food and forced to wrap up, given ample time to enjoy the music &amp; ambiance.    I have recommened this place to quite a few people. ",4
" The food, drinks (moonshine sangria) and live music were great!  First time i had southern food! I had shrimp and grits! Delicious!! The entertainment was great! Would highly recommend for a lively night out! ",4
 I was in town for a conference and was looking for a place to eat. This place was vibrant. The food and drinks were good and the live music was jamming. ,5
" The Juke Joint was rockin' on Friday night but we missed the live band performance by one whole minute! Our group is from an East coast city and we weren't accustomed to a jazz club closing at midnight. So we decided to reconvene for Sunday brunch. There was a really good pre-recording of a soloist artist but it was interrupted by a one person ensemble on key board. The brunch was mediocre at best. In my opinion, if Mary Mac's was opened next door and offered live music, business for Sweet Georgia's Juke Joint would quickly fade. ",3
" I like Blues and they had a live BLues Band playing.  The atmosphere was nice, the food was great, and the service was outstanding.  Oh yeah, the bad was good as well. ",4
" I went here with high hopes, but the food was not very good (and quite expensive for what you got) and the service was UNBELIEVABLY slow.  I did like the live music though, very much. ",2
" Everything was great except our food experience.  I love the food at the Juke Joint but this past Sunday the 9th of November, my food order was given to another table then when food did arrive it looked as if it was thrown together and didn't look as presented to the table that received my order in error.  My dates food came and looked warmed over and as a result we refused to re-order, only had drinks.  The manager didn't even offer to comp one of our meals or discount the drinks in any way!  It seemed they just shrugged us off and moved on to the next tables and even OUR guests we invited because we were edifying the food when we asked them to join us. James Bailey II  678-913-5331. ",2
 The food was great and the band The PR Experience was awesome.  My husband n I had a great time.  Only drawback was my advance reservation did not make much of a difference in seating.  Seems as though I could have gotten a better table if we had just walked up without a reservation.  We will be back. ,4
" I came to this restaurant for my 25year wedding anniversary, The staff was amazing, The owner greeted me with a smile and respect, Me and wife had the best evening, I strongly recommend this place for a night out for couples and family. ",5
" Crawfish Etoufee, fried green tomatoes, fried okra, honey kissed fried chicken, sweet potato pie.  Need I say more.  All delicious and tasted like they were home cooked.  Very convenient location downtown, and super popular with the local crowd.  I understand why.  Not sure its the best southern food I've had (some competition in New Orleans), but it's darn close.  While I liked the music, it was very loud and hard to talk to the people at the table.  Service is outstanding.  By the way, try the local moonshine drinks like the Shine-Gria.  Potent.  Tasty.  Time to order another. ",5
 Nice restaurant..Food was just okay..Not a good place for casual conversation due to the noise (very loud) from the entertainment and the seating. I did not agree with the $5 per person entertainment fee. ,3
" I took my mom and aunt there for their B'day and they loooved it and so did I, the food,  drinks, music and atmosphere was great. ",5
 This was my 1st time visiting Sweet Georgia's Juke Joint. I really enjoyed the ambiance and our server was Great! The group performing which was Milkshake Mayfield was Outstanding. I will be visiting again. ,4
" Wanted to take my wife out for Anniversary. Great place ,love the live music ",5
" It was the fourth visit since relocating to ATL a year ago. The waitress was rushed, the chicken was over cooked and/or reheated and greasy. Service was slow. Repeated requests for cornbread went unanswered, in fact after asking three times the waitress finally commented we don't have any! Do you see anyone else with it? I don't know about you but I expect and enjoy cornbread with my beans and greens. ",1
" The fried chicken is phenomenal, the service is personable, the manager is passionate about satisfaction... and the ambiance - relaxing but upbeat, makes you want to sing. Great food great experience. ",5
 Had the pleasure of dining at the Juke Joint while in Atlanta with my wife. We we re greeted at the front desk when we came in and we're told very clearly that there would be a 5 dollar fee per person for the live entertainment.  We had read this so we understood. The food was fantastic and the moonshine drinks were over the top delicious. Our server Melinda made the evening for us. She was helpful and always willing to make a recommendation to help us decide. We had a great time and will be back. ,5
" Expected a fun environment for Sunday morning brunch, but it wasn't. They should advertise that there is no alcohol served before noon along with their endless mimosas. Service was slow. It took at least 10 minutes before our waitress even stopped at our table and the restaurant was not busy. Food was really salty and unmemorable. ",2
" Visiting from NYC and this spot was right down the block from our Hotel. Great food, atmosphere,  drinks &amp; entertainment!!! Loved it! ",5
 Chicken was undercooked. Tables are small. My husband and I sat near a high traffic area near the register in the dining room. I am petite and felt squished. I am happy I crossed this restaurant off my list. ,2
" The food was outstanding, but the seating is too cramped.  You are literally table to table. Other than the cramped tables, I think this restaurant is more for a party than an intimate dinner. ",5
 The food was fantastic! The entertainment (Milkshake) was fabulous! I'll definitely be back and will spread the word to all my friends. ,4
" We are foodies and love eating at really nice restaurants. The two things we expect is great food and even better service. When we entered, the hostess took us to our table. It was a light crowd so, we asked if we could move to another table and she said no. No explanation, no smile just a flat no. Which was okay until we saw another party come in who wanted a different table and she showed them another...they didn't like that one so she took them to another.  My feelings were hurt.  Our waitress was very nice, so that made up for our rude hostess.  We ordered the chicken and waffles, French toast with sausage and shrimp and grits. The food was very disappointing and cold. My sausage patties looked poached or steamed and not fried. I initially thought it was under cooked. My French toast had a good flavor but was thin/flat. No presentation or substance at all. I could go on but...We ended up with an $81 bill for breakfast and didn't order any cocktails. After tip we paid $95 not good for breakfast at all. ",2
" Food was mediocre, had the fried chicken it was good but didn't stand out from any other fried chicken I've had.  Service was polite and friendly but forgot to bring our salads before dinner.  Loved the live music during dinner but don't think they should charge a $5 per person charge to have dinner there because they provide music. ",3
" Great venue, close to the Westin Hotel.  Food was ecellent and service was very good. ",4
 Absolutely amazing. The band..omg. soul cartel!!! ,5
" I made reservations to take my mom to Sweet Georgia's Juke Joint for her birthday on 9/15/15. Upon arriving we were seated at this small table right that was very congested. I could literally hear everyone's conversation which was not good. I booked this place because they have live bands, well the live band turned out to be one man and his piano who I could not understand what he was saying or singing because he didn't have any teeth. He didn't know many songs either. We ordered our drinks, but our waitress was not the friendliest. We changed our minds about ordering any food since everything was not good, so we decided to just pay for the drinks and leave. It was just not good. We also had to pay 5 dollars per person for entertainment fee which would have been fine if the entertainment was good. so I spent thirty dollars for ten wasted minutes. I was very disappointed because I wanted my mom to have a good time for her birthday and Sweet Georgia's Juke Joint blew it. :( Upon leaving I tried to let the hostess know upfront of my concerns and her response was well no one else is bored or disappointed. In other words she just did not care. ",1
 Food was delicious! ,4
 This is my go to spot whenever I have people in town visiting and I want to show them a good time. I recommend it to people all the time when they are looking for a nice dinner restaurant with a little extra. ,5
 Food was delicious. Definitely enjoyed the live band! ,5
 Loved the fried chicken..... ,4
 The food was good.  The music was good.  a great time by all. ,4
" Food was good, nothing extraordinary but consistent and above average. Service was very good and the band was well worth the $5. They involved the guests. We ate brunch but would love to go back to hear the band at night! ",4
" I do not recommend this place. We were charged a $5 fee entertainment fee however the band was late and only played for a third of the time we were there. I ordered smoked wings at 12:30pm and was told they would not be ready for another hour as they were still smoking them. The food was ok, nothing out of the ordinary and the service was mediocre. ",2
 The food was good and the service was very good I love waitress  she was awesome it was just good all the way round it was my daughters 30th birthday and they sang to her I will be back again and bring people that comes in town ,5
 This was first visit and were very please.  We had a excellent server.  Way to go Jukejoint ,5
" Great food, service and entertainment! We had a great time! Thank-you. ",5
" The food, music, and service is usually top notch. Definite place to eat while in Atlanta. However, this visit, the service was slow, though the waiter apologized, and the collard greens were overcooked. But the music other dishes and drinks were good. ",4
" My second time dining at Sweet Georgia's Juke Joint. Love the live music &amp; food. The Peach Cobbler was awesome, and I'm not a fan of cobbler. Will be back next year as visiting Atlanta has become an annual trip. ",5
" I ordered the fried chicken; it was just so-so, nothing to write home about.   I don't have any ",3
 We had a lot of fun!  Amazing service that was genuine. ,4
 The music was awesome. Everything else was ehhhh. :-/ ,3
" We were in town for a convention and had been recommended this place by locals. We certainly were not disappointed! The food was good, and the music was fantastic. Overall a very fun and lively place! ",5
" Went for lunch with a couple of friends. Delicious meal, what you expect from Montana’s. Great service, meals came promptly and friendly staff. ",5
" Good Ole Southern Food!  Fit for a starving gal for some fried chicken, okra, sweet potatoes, chicken n biscuit, mac n cheese  and fried green tomatoes!  Yumm... the service was excellent and the food was served hot to the table!  cooked to perfection! ",5
 We had brunch July. 5th with out of town guest  total of 8.  We arrived at 12:17  we were seated about 12:30p ordered our food 12:47 received our food at 2:07p and  2:30p we left restaurant 3:12p..... REALLY yes we kept track of time!  The restaurant wasn't overly crowded and we watched other patrons come and go all afternoon as we waited for our Signature Chicken and Waffles.... Management was useless and our waiter clueless!  Very disappointed the food was good but service and management HORRIBLE! I would not recommend this for large parties can't handle the  pressure! ,1
" The price was comparitively high for the quality of food and service. $5 for a miniscule bowl of steamed broccoli seemed steep.  Fried green tomatoes were good.  I had shrimp and grits, the main seasoning was butter. If you like fried chicken, it is probably your place. I asked for more sweet potato rolls because they were good. I was told they were out and we went to dinner early! The music was fun. There is a reasonable $5 cover for music. Amusing that they calculate gratuity for you including the cover charge. ",3
 We loved the live music. We enjiyed the wings and fried green tomatoes befire our nain dish ,5
 The decor and the live band were spectacular.  Food wasn't bad either. ,5
" We went for New Years Eve with our children, we got there just as it was starting to pick up. The waitress was great. Our food wasn't great, my husband ordered his steak medium well, and it was rare. i ordered mine well, and half was burnt the other was medium, it was not a great night for our outing. Usually the food is pretty good, but someone dropped the ball on this occasion. ",3
 Very good time.  Food was great and service quick and friendly ,5
" Sorry to say, but this was not a good experience.  The food was sparce, at best, and not very good either.  None of us were impressed with the food for the price.  It was so loud; hard to have a conversation...and we were eating with the 'blue hairs' at 4:30! The beer was cold though, and the waitress gave me a weird look when I asked for a glass!?  Poor girl, she was either being so fake with her high-pitched, sing-songy voice, or she was a true valley girl.   So...to sum it all up...we spent $60 to have a conversation with our friends.  Sad... ",2
 They have all you can eat Ribs on Wednesday. But the Ribs were sold out at 7.45pm. ☹ ,3
 we were disapointed in one of the meals and got it changed.. the fries were cold and steak cooked too much on another meal.. the third meal the baked potato must have been leftover from lunch it was way overcooked and tasted warmed up we were shocked at the price of $12 plus for a glass of wine when we received the bill the waitress had put extra glass of wine on our bill instead of our friends and she had charged for a topping that she had initially said was a free promo but she was able to correct that ,2
 The new bench design provides very little barrier between your table and the next one over.  The majority of our meal were spent being jostled and pushed by the other table.    The food was over cooked and had hair cooked into it.  The music was so loud you could barely hear your server or those at your table.   Overall I would not return to this location. ,2
 Better knowledge with this app would make things go better. ,5
 Love the atmosphere here..small and friendly ,5
" Fun place on Peachtree. Definitely not your standard downtown eatery. I came for the live music and was not disappointed. Band was engaging, with the leader working very hard to involve the audience. I really enjoyed the fresh spin they put on 80s pop standards.   Food was just ok. I got the pulled pork which I thought was average. I also had fried okra which had obviously been under a heat lamp for hours as it was hot, but not crisp. Overall tastes, but not outstanding. ",4
" Food was average.  The place was very loud.  Service was inattentive and slow.  Had to ask for water 4 times (to two different people) before it was finally brought.  Overall a ""so-so"" experience.  I was visiting Atlanta for work, not sure that this is a place I would return to if I'm in town again. ",2
" I loved this place when it FIRST OPENED.  Now, it's merely a tourist spot.  If I'm paying for a dinner and drinks, why would you charge a $5 entertainment fee?  A $5 entertainment fee is acceptable if I’m merely sitting at the bar, but if I’m supporting the restaurant by making a reservation to enjoy dinner &amp; drinks the live music should be complimentary.  And on this night there wasn’t even a full band, but a single act…smh.  The $5 entertainment fee was not implemented when the restaurant first opened, but like so many other establishments that experience success in Atlanta, Sweet Georgia Juke Joint got ""brand new"" and the down home feeling has been replaced with a bougie flare.  Also, parking was once validated and FREE now there’s a $5 parking charge.  So now, we’re spending $15 just to park and listen to music before we even enjoy the food and drinks….smh!  For those two reasons, I once was a loyal and regular supporter, but now I rarely support this restaurant anymore.  However, my out-of-town colleagues enjoyed the food, drinks and live music.  The food is still tasty, but the atmosphere is no longer as live and vivid as it once was. ",3
" We popped in to visit family and decided to eat at Sweet Georgia's Juke Joint. The staff was eager to serve and the ambiance was great. D Mack was the live entertainment for he night. The staff was there for your every need. Brad was the server, he made some phenomenal suggestions. The food was to die for. I cannot say enough about the fun and food that was had at Sweet Georgia's Juke Joint. Thanks again Sweet Georgia's Juke Joint for a time to remember. ",5
" I've been a few times in the past and never had anything but good things to say about the juke joint...but this particular day, we went for the jazz brunch and the band never showed up. There was no valet parking for some reason. And we had a new waiter which left us waiting quite a bit (to the point where we had to keep grabbing some other passing waiting to ask for stuff) and a few of our order items were messed up as well. But we all enjoyed our food and the ambiance is nice. ",2
" Highly recommended.  Terrific food, and service.  Friendly  staff overall and 'have a good time' atmosphere. ",5
" This was my second time at sweet Georgia juke joint, and definitely my worst. What was even more unfortunate, was that I was with a group &amp; I recommended the restaurant. To quickly sum up a pretty bad story: the service was pretty bad (I'm talking side eyes when we asked for condiments, forgetting drinks, and never bringing the manager when asked). I had the burger - which was underwhelming. Not gross, but nothing special. One person at our table had food that was ""still cooking"" when everyone else received their food. When her grilled chicken sandwich did arrive, she said that it was raw. Her bun was cold and soggy as well. This was a lunch meal, and I'm not sure if that contributed to the disappointing experience. On previous occasions, I had been for dinner with a large party. The food and ambiance was great - just very, very slow. Hopefully sweet Georgia juke joint gets a little sweeter soon. ",2
" Nice venue, attentive service, and good food.  I had the Juke Joint Pulled Pork with baked beans and sweet potato fries.     Suggestion: Make reservation, 2-3 weeks out for weekends. ",4
" Food was good and the staff was friendly. If l lived in Atlanta, l would definitely go back. ",4
" Loved the down home feel to this place.  Visiting ATL from out of town and staying across the street at the Ritz, and was looking for a place to dine with live music or jazz.  The food was excellent with all the southern favorites, and for desert the ""peach cobbler"" is to die for.  The have a variety of entertainment on different nights and the band that we heard was awesome.  Played old school R&amp;B and many times people were up dancing in front of the stage.  The owner was on scene and came over to our table and introduced himself.  It seemed to be very crowded and their was a wait if you did not have reservations, and the music can be loud at times.  If you like good southern food, good music and good times you should give this place a try. ",4
" The peach moonshine drink was awesome! I loved the fried catfish and the collard greens, however; the smoked chicken wings were bland and a bit dry. All in all, its a great place to enjoy good food and music! ",4
 Great for Sunday Brunch. There was a one man band playing. He was good but not good enough for the $20 music fee that was added to our bill. I don't like surprises like that. ,4
" The staff are friendly and attentive. My only complaint is the performer. I enjoy interacting with my guests but the performers are much too LOUD! We were hardly able to converse without shouting.  The artist should be a background compliment, not a concert performance to contend with. ",4
 Food was very good &amp; the music was excellent! The service was above average but the server was forgetful and had to be reminded a several time on several different occasions. ,4
" Very good meal , excellent service.  Warm and cozy ",5
" We went for my bday weekend and stayed at the Inn. Attended daytime wine opening at Glendora where food was also served. It was excellent - roast pork, lovely vegetables and potatoes - along with cheeses and fruit.  The food was so good, we excitedly anticipated our dinner for the evening.  We had reservations.  There were many tables open. We asked to sit by the window and were told by the gentleman seating us that they were set for 4. All tables were set for four we said. He then replied there was a power outage in Watkins Glen so they would be busy. Point is- we were paying guests and made to feel like intruders.  Not a pleasant start. Our waitress was excellent. Friendly. Helped me with my gluten allergy needs. We had read excellent reviews regarding the food but we were not taken to the level we expected with taste or conducive to the cost of the dishes. Presentation was nice - although my side  salad was too big, very large lettuce leaves and too much dressing.  My husbands squash soup was lovely.  I had salmon and he had ox tail. Both were very bland. The carrot purée with the salmon had no flavor. We brought home leftover ox tail and I added some sage and thyme. It definitely helped increase the flavor of the stew. Although we are not big dessert eaters, since it was my birthday we ordered a gluten free one. It was delicious.   We were concerned the wine tastings we had during the day may have impaired our tastes buds - although I was able to add flavor to the stew. We do plan to return and try again.  If we get the same host, I will speak up. His behavior put a negative curve on our experience. We had breakfast there the next morning and he again verbally made a fuss about seating others by the window. Embarrassing and caused undo discomfort. Breakfast, sadly was just as plain tasting. I NEVER use salt at the table but found myself salting my food.  I am truly hoping our next visit finds 5 star worthy food. The Inn and Winery are outstanding. ",4
" It was wonderful. A little chilly in the place but vaulted ceilings will do that. The special touches like the little bite the chef sent out before first course and, the dipping sauces with th rustic bread and the in house made chocolate at the end of the meal. So delicious so appreciated. ",5
 Wonderful meal - fresh local ingredients prepared to perfection ,5
" I had high expectations for this restaurant, however, it fell short.  The menu is too small to have two vegetarian dishes.  The grilled corn soup tasted like a chili base, not corn soup.  The overpriced filet mignon was very small.  The swordfish was overcooked.  We would not go back. ",3
" It was really unfortunate that this highly touted and expensive restaurant was such a disappointment. We ordered small plates because the entrees were so complex with ingredients, with some I’ve never heard of.  We shared 5 small plates and the cheese board for dessert. The time in between service was exceedingly long, because of the lack of sufficient staffing . The empanada was so highly spiced, as to burn my tongue. Also, many entries on the wine list were not a available. Sometimes when you have such a frustrating experience you can laugh it off, well, I’m not laughing ! ",2
" Most of the food was bland, my wife's steak was overcooked, then it took over 20 minutes for it to come back rare ",3
" We ate here for my birthday.  The mussels in curry cream sauce were amazing.  The crab cake had an abundance of crab.  The entrees were wonderful.  My husband's fillet was cooked perfectly and my snapper was wonderful.  Presentation was wonderful.  We had dessert too.  the lemon and the  caramel desserts were yummy.  There were 3 desserts per dish and they were tasty.  It is expensive, but with a bottle of Glenora Brut champagne it was wonderful. ",5
" As always, when in unfamiliar territory, Open Table gives us great options! Veraisons is a perfect example: Was visiting the Finger Lakes in NY for the first time and wanted a good restaurant with a lake view. This restaurant provided both! And excellent meal and a wonderful menu with several very good choices: We chose to share PEI Mussels in a fabulous curry sauce, and then each of us had small plate ""specials"": Wonderful crab cakes and lamb chops. Desserts were very good, but not as exceptional as the rest of the meal. Wine pairings at this winery were excellent! And the view of Lake Geneva was stunning and even included a double rainbow! (Not sure the rainbow is included in every meal…) Service friendly, efficient and helpful! ",5
 We stayed at the Inn at Glenora Wine Cellars and had both dinner and breakfast at   Veraisons.  Ratings above are based on dinner.  Wonderful view of the vineyard and Seneca Lake.  We shared both a cheese board and salad for appetizers.  Both were very good and generous portions.  The cheese board was especially interesting. For main courses we had the duck magret and pasta with lamb ragout. Both were good; portions were relatively smaller than the appetizers.  Service was excellent  Breakfast was good but we were somewhat disappointed by what we ordered (cinnamon bun French toast and cornmeal pancakes).  Eggs might have been a better choice ,4
" We had previously eaten at Veraisons and had a good meal.  This time was disappointing. The food was over cooked and under seasoned.  On the positive side, they do have a variety of gluten and other allergen free items.  The wine list was good with a good selection of local wines.    The restaurant itself is lovely and the view over the lake is spectacular.  The service was outstanding--if only the food had been as good. ",3
 Came up to Seneca Lake for a long weekend and found this place just by googling around. It's a great spot for a little more of an upscale dining experience. We sat outside on the patio which was cold but they had blankets which made it very cozy! We just didn't want to give up the view of the lake! The food was great. Farm to Table style. You need to try the duck carnitas small plate! Mimi was our server and we couldn't have had a more delightful person guiding us through our meal! We would love to go back if we're in the area again. ,5
" Beautiful view of Seneca Lake, lovely outdoor seating, although it was unusually cool and rainy during our meal so we could not take advantage of it. Pretty bar area separate from large dining room. Brightly lit. ",4
 The staff is friendly and attentive and the view is stunning and what separates it from most places . Definitely would recommend. ,5
 A very nice vineyard/hotel venue. Very good food and wine. Seated on porch that was very nice ambiance. Server was very nice but service was extremely slow. Waited 15+ minutes for dessert. ,3
" Glad to see a variety of gf options. Focaccia bread was stale but my gf rolls were delicious! Two orders of filet mignon were ok and the two orders of the gf lamb parpadelle were just ok, very bland. ",4
 Anniversary ,5
 We had a great dinner on the porch overlooking the lake. Service was excellent--we are vegetarian and the server made sure we could eat butter before bringing the bread. The views were lovely and the food was good. The only criticism is that the kids' flatbread was made with a strong cheese that wasn't quite kid friendly. Everything else was very good. ,5
" Great food, super service and a breathtaking view of Seneca Lake. A must for anyone who wants a wonderful and romantic dinner in the Finger Lakes. ",5
 Great outdoor dining &amp; view. Food was good ,3
" Without a reservation we were able to get a seat even though they were very busy.  They sat us at a beautiful table on their patio overlooking Lake Seneca.  The menu identifies things like GF-Gluten Free, DF-Dairy Free, etc. This to a person with allergies is great news. It also indicates that you have a professional chef on site. The rest of the staff is in tune with different types of restrictions as well.   We returned several times during our stay in the Finger Lakes.  They have a very well thought out menu.  Prices were reasonable. Service by Evan, Lacy and Sabrina were excellent. ",5
" We loved everything about the restaurant. The ambience, food, wine and view were excellent. We will definitely return if we go back to Seneca lake ",5
" The setting was absolutely gorgeous, overlooking the vineyards.  The food was excellent, but on the pricey side. You do have to allow a couple of hours for a leisurely dinner, since the service is slow, but the beautiful setting is worth it. A must when visiting the Finger Lakes. ",5
 We had a wonderful time. Great food and wine. Lots/plenty of house-made items from scratch. ,5
 Wine and food were just Ok and over priced for what we received. We seated in the downstairs auxiliary seating area as the main dining area was closed for a wedding reception. Thus ruining the view of Lake Seneca and the vineyards. Probably would not return. ,3
 Fabulous meal.  Fabulous service.  We had a vegan in our group and the waitress and kitchen made the entire experience a pleasure.  Can't wait to return. ,5
" We were thrilled that we were able to be seated on a Friday evening on the deck, even though we had just changed our reservation (from Saturday when we were informed there was a wedding to Friday). Thus we enjoyed a beautiful view with a good meal on the whole, but with some variability between our choices. The mussel appetizer with the curry broth was good to the last drop! The grilled corn soup though tasty was rather a strange color? The bulgogi lettuce cups were also delicious, but it was a shame there was so little beef and far too many lettuce leaves. We would recommend the charcuterie and local artisanal cheese boards, however. Everyone at the table wanted to try our fellow diner's lamb ragu over papadelle noodle-it tasted like our Italian grandmother had made it. The salmon and tuna special entrees were just average. The duck entree with cherry sauce however, melted in your mouth! Everyone enjoyed a spoonful of the lemon plate desserts. Although the servers were friendly, they were often absent and seemed a little inexperienced-we were without a spoon, a knife or a fork at various times and for some time. They also chose to reach across the diners to clear plates, even though there was plenty of space to move around us. Overall, the evening was a hit confirmed by several other parties celebrating different events. ",4
" Our meal was excellent!  In fact, we were guests at the Inn and decided that there was no need to drive around looking for a better dining experience. so we had dinner there the second night too. Again the food and service were wonderful! ",5
" We wanted to sit out on the veranda but all the tables were taken, however  it only took them a few minutes to set a table for us. The view of Lake Seneca and the vineyard was bucolic.  Had the cheese board which was magnificent with local cheeses, sweet grapes and good bread.  The butter was super creamy, couldn't get enough of it.  Had the salmon, the pappardelle with braised  lamb, and the chicken--all delicious. The portions are large so be warned --not for the petite of appetite but you would have great leftovers to enjoy later with the wines of Glenora.  Enjoyed the Glenora Brut and the Pinot blanc. The rose was very drinkable. The Cabernet Sauvignon was somewhat flabby, not much body or structure to it, so sad to say it disappointed. ",5
 I requested their best table for my wife's birthday.  A wedding party had reserved the main dining area so we were seating in their wine cellar.  The food was good however some of the service lacking.  I noticed we didn't get a bread basket prior to our meal as the surrounding tables.  I had to ask for it after our meal was delivered.  It would have been nice to have the bread with our wine prior to our entrees being served. ,4
 I went with the $45 Steak special. Asked for it Medium and it came out extremely Well-Done.  The potatatoes that came with it had the consistency of sand. ,3
 The mussels are amazing and the wines are wonderful! ,4
 Birthday dinner out in the deck.. great view to match always great dishes and wine. Never a bad night here!! ,5
" One of the nicest restaurants on Seneca. The food is relatively inventive for the area and well prepared. Nice array of options for all.  Views to die for over the lake...if you get the right table. There was a wedding when we went and the top floor was unavailable (the better vistas), so we went to the bottoms level which lacked any ambiance for a restaurant of this caliber. This floor has limited lake views also.  The restaurant would really benefit from more outdoor seating facing the lake (there is some on the front patio facing the road). Feels like a missed opportunity for them and/or a more casual sister restaurant (a growing trend in the business).  Bottom line: they delivered on expectations and it was a nice evening. I'll likely be back too. There's just so much more opportunity to make things better. ",4
 We waited 20 mins to be acknowledged by our waitress.  It was not busy.  The food was okay but not worth the price.  The winery was a much better experience than the restaurant at Glenora. ,2
" We were here for a birthday vacation. I made these reservations based on the reviews. However we were moved to the lower level because there was a wedding. They called it the wine cellar but it felt more like an office space. The server didn't tell us the specials. I had to ask and I only did because I heard the server behind us telling his table. I ordered split pea soup which was basically beef broth with peas. I also ordered the pappardelle with braised rabbit, which was horrible. There was no flavor. I had to ask for salt and pepper. I couldn't even eat a full bite. It clearly looked like it was sitting under the heat lamp too long. The pork belly buns were mediocre at best. We were there for two hours because the service was so slow and it was only the two of us. One couple came in after us and were finished their meals before we even got ours. For the price we paid and the quality of the food, I would not recommend this to anyone. There are way better options. ",1
 The cheese plate was excellent including the crackers.  The desserts were well thought out and amazing.  There was a beautiful view of the lake at sunset.  This is one of the few upscale restaurants in the area. ,5
 We stayed at the Inn so it was nice to eat right there in the restaurant. Friday night fish fry was very good. ,3
" Fish tacos were dry and smelled fishy. Not enough beyond fish to make this palatable. The dessert was pretentious and overpriced at $12. Something with a roasted beet, a poor red velvet cake and some other things that added nothing. The cream cheese ice cream was the only decent thing in this dessert. A simpler creation would work so much better. ",3
" We ate here twice during our stay. Our waiter, Kyle, was the best.  We tried both the cheese and charcuterie board, soup and salad as well as 4 entrees.  All were well prepared/presented.  Squash soup was outstanding, salad OK.  Salmon, pork chop, chicken and duck were all flavorful and creative.  Extensive wine list with the majority Glenora or sister wineries.  The dining room presentation was great as was the pacing of the delivery of the food.  Full bar was available.  Good coffee for after dinner. ",5
" My husband and I had been to this establishment twice before and had a great time during both visits. When my parents decided to come to town for a visit, we couldn't wait to take them. Unfortunately, this time we went, the experience was not as we'd had in the past. First, the food was mediocre. My husband found a LONG blonde string of hair in his food. We told the manager, who immediately asked if my husband would like a different meal. My husband asked for a different dish with the understanding that he was being provided a customer service due to the inconvenience of having found hair in his food. To our surprise, when the bill arrived, the new dish was included and not complimentary - as it should have been given the experience he'd just gone through. Needless to say, we were disappointed. I had ordered a Caesar salad. To my surprise, the salad was poorly made. It had very little salad dressing and no cheese...which I had to request. The server was clearly stressed out and had a difficult time keeping up with the various customer requests. We had to remind him several times to bring napkins, salad dressing, etc. Also worth mentioning is the fact that one of our reasons for going to this place was the live music. We were VERY disappointed that the band's playlist mostly included music from Frank Sinatra and easy-listening styled jazz as opposed to the typical blues, soul and funk heard in a ""Juke Joint"" atmosphere. We intentionally took our parents there because of the live music we'd heard there in the past, and were once again let down by the band's performance. Lastly, guests with reservations are typically given a 2 hour table time for dining. Needless to say, we did not stay anywhere near this time due to our disappointment with all of the above and more. After spending over $150 for this disappointing time, I don't think we'll be back. ",2
" Music was fantastic. Food was very tasty and authentic. Service was ok, but my order wasn't right on two occasions.  Very friendly about it though, so that made up for it. ",5
" Good food, good ambiance, wonderful service! I would recommend to anyone looking for good upscale southern food downtown Atlanta. ",5
 Food was delicious!!! Live entertainment was amazing!! ,5
" High school students loved the food, esoecially the collard greens. ",5
" Sweet Georgia's was a pleasant surprise and excellent find. Not only was the food fantastic, we were thrilled to hear some amazing live music. The next time you are in downtown Atlanta, don't just walk but run to Sweet Georgia's, your soul with thank you later. ",5
 Food was great!  Musical entertainment was Great!  Great atmosphere! ,5
" We were looking for southern food in downtown Atlanta and this place was amazing! We had the fried chicken and banana pudding, which were both amazing. Also, the peach cocktail was de-lish! We were there on a Monday night and delighted that live jazz music was being played by a very entertaining group. We stayed for two hours after dinner to enjoy the entertainment! I would go back here and recommend this to friends. ",5
 The entertainment was starting as we had to return to a meeting but it was a perfect meal for our needs and seemed that an evening would be well spent here. ,4
" We were celebration my birthday, the solo artist was fantastic an Friday and Monday was even more enjoyable with the 3 man band.  FANTASTIC rom beginning till end... ",5
 Great place for a get together with friends or that special one. ,5
" My husband and I went for Sunday brunch and really enjoyed ourselves.  There were a good amount of food choices, and what we had was really tasty.  The jazz band playing set a good atmosphere in the restaurant.  We would return if we find ourselves in Atlanta again. ",3
 This was a great local option in an area full of chain restaurants. The service was friendly and the food was good. It is pretty loud with the live music so if you're looking to have an in depth conversation with your dining partner(s) this might not be the place for you. We had brunch and the bottomless mimosas were a steal! I'd definitely recommend this as one of the best options in the area. ,4
" Went for Sunday brunch.  The food was excellent and the service was a bit slow.  The live entertainment hadn't started,  so that was a bit disappointing.   Overall? Very good experience. ",4
" As a locale, I only go here to entertain out-of-town guests. It's a hassle because of the popularity it's no longer a chill spot for good food &amp; live music. A reservation is required,  no more free validated parking &amp; the absurd $5 entertainment fee (yet the band is still allowed to ask for tips-tips &amp; have a tip jar-Not classy). The staff person, Virginia,  was super unprofessional &amp; rude when she called to confirm our appointment &amp; when we called. Mo was super sweet!  The food, live music,  ambiance , &amp; location have allowed for tourists to keep this restaurant in business. ",3
 Food was delicious and Service was great! ,4
" Great menu to pick from a variety of southern food choices.  Great drink selection from the bar. Service excellent.  Food hot and very tasteful, dessert a must.  Live music set the tone for a fun dining experience. ",5
" The gumbo had a vinegar taste to it.I ordered the catfish and grits,the grits tasted like corn meal and we're extremely gritty. The catfish was bland and not cooked  well .opted for another meal which was fried chicken but I guess the grease was old the chicken was horrible left the food in the to go box on the seat on purpose ",3
 Loved overall experience and the fried green tomatoes were to for!! ,5
 Very Good and quick service. I enjoyed the experience. ,4
 Phenomenal food! Parmesean grits (to die for) and the French toast...oh my goodness! Music was wonderful. ,5
" I would not recommend going to the Juke Joint if you want quick lunch service; slow although  they were not busy. Our server Cliff was very knowledgeable of the menu.   We did enjoy the atmosphere and the music was not overbearing, we were able to talk to each other in a moderate tone. ",3
" Was a quiet weekday and they had concert footage of Seal on the big screen at a perfect volume to enjoy but still be able to talk. Next was Tina Turner, so fun to see. The food was delicious and our server was just the nicest and you could tell she was really proud and happy to be working there. Love to go back next time we are in town for a concert. ",5
 The food and entertainment were amazing. ,5
 The overall experience was great!   We were able to listen and see the band with ease. Everyone enjoyed the dish they order and the wine was great! An OHIOAN ,4
 Fantastic service in a fun environment.  Great variety of menu choices and well cooked meals. ,5
" My husband, daughter (age 17) and I came to Sweet Georgia's on a Tuesday evening.  The music was great, service top-notch and food was delicious.  I highly recommend Sweet Georgia's for a fun night out for family and/or friends. ",5
" Live music and amazing food? Yes, please! The place is pricey (after the entertainment fee and tip, we spent $80 for 3 people- and we ordered water!), but it's worth the experience. Regina Troupe was a great performer who can work the crowd without feeling intrusive, the wait staff was super polite and friendly, and the food was delicious. Our 8 year old daughter was enthralled with the music. It's a nice walk from the big hotels downtown, and it's on Peachtree Street. Can't get much better than this. ",5
 I was expecting better. Just ordinary to me.  The food was ok. I had fried chicken and it sat on some greens that were covered in what seemed to be balsamic vinegar. ,3
 Our group had a great time! The food was amazing and they had live entertainment. Great vibes ,4
" Good meal, excellent banana pudding, will return again. ",4
" We happened upon this place looking for a restaurant for brunch. This was a pleasant surprise. The host was a great the wait staff (Dwayne) was prompt and professional and the food was exceptional! It is definitely on our list of ""must returns.""  The only thing I would suggest is that they indicate on the site that valet parking is $10 cash, no cards accepted. However, the valet staff were very nice as we went to the ATM. ",5
 The food was just fair.  My wife had a hamburger that was dry.  I had ribs that were acceptable but nothing special.  My daughter had fried chicken which she thought was quite good.  There was live music which was quite good but made conversation difficult. ,3
 We were pretty much ignored our entire visit. We had early reservations and were the first customers there. Took 10 min for someone to ask if we had someone take our drink orders yet. The food was just ok. Nothing special. ,3
" Food was okay, it wasn't horrible just didn't get on the plate what was described in the menu and manager argued that we were wrong. Food wasn't hot, just warm and only 1 server which lead to subpar service. Will try it again, before I completely rule them out. ",3
 My first time dining here and will not be my last! Everything from the greeting by valet parking to the hostess to the wait staff was 5 star! Food was excellent and the atmosphere was delightful. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this restaurant and look forward to coming back again! ,5
 Live Jazz Band - so the noise level is expected. Overall it's a great location and the food was very well prepared and tasty. ,5
" Food was okay. Service wasn't the best. Waiter was not personable seemed as though he had an attitude. No suggestions seemed like he was in a hurry. Asked for suggestions just read a couple of things off the menu, and by time we sat down he should have been out if the weeds because there were open tables everywhere.My son had the fried chicken which the chicken was good. Had a  Macncheese which was very good by surprise and baked beans where not a favorite. Everyone else got the chicken and waffles which was not good at all. ",3
 A great downtown live music venue 7 nights a week and we were hugely impressed by the Tony Tatum Experience who had the whole place partying by the end of their third set. ,5
" This was my second time at Seeet Georgia's. The group I took was different but had the same opinion when the dinner was over, what good food and what a good time. The music was fun and lively. ",5
" A group of us attended to celebrate a birthday.  The food came out lukewarm at best.  Our service was poor, we had to wave our server down several times.  It was very disappointing. ",2
" The service at this restaurant on a random Wednesday night was TERRIBLE! I can only imagine what the weekends are like.  It took 25 minutes just to get a waiter assigned to our table and when we finally did, they didn't even bring out water...we had to ask!  And to add fuel to the fire, the food was disgusting.  Who puts sugar in fried chicken batter?? I would not recommend this restaurant. ",1
" After flying to Atlanta from DC, it was a great treat to spend an evening with a friend at this wonderful place. The music was good and so was the food. I thought it was a little off pudding to have a $5 fee for entertainment. ",4
" It was our group's first time there and it was delightful. The server was funny, the music was entertaining and the food was tasty. We will be back. ",4
 I currently live in the DC/MD/VA area and Sunday was my 2nd time visiting the restaurant. The food has been amazing each time and the live music takes the restaurant to the next level. It was a little loud initially but you soon become acclimated. The band (The PR Experience) put on a great show. I  plan to dine here every time I visit to Atlanta! ,5
" This place could be awesome, but the service is very slow and the food was lacking so much. We were served coffee three times before it was brought out without a foreign object in it or hot! ",1
" we had a great time, service was Great...and entertainment was nice. Food however was very disappointing. Not for good eatting,Great moonshine drinks and Good time though.. my out of town guess enjoyed themselves. ",3
 Took my Best friend here for her birthday and she ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!! I will definitely be back!! :-) ,5
" Yes, the food was indisputably delicious...but I was there for the live music. And Soul Cartel did not let me down...excellent choice if you want to dance while you munch!!! ",4
 It was a wonderful place with the right food and ambiance. The band and décor was so mesmerizing it leaves you feeling great throughout your meal. ,4
" Special place to dine in the heart of the city, right on Peachtree amidst the crowds and dazzle of Atlanta.  Juke joint had all the bells and whistle, great live entertainment that's very engaging to the crowd. Very tasty dishes that comes out fresh and hot. I recommend the juke joint chicken with turkey collard greens and bake beans superb.  Over all it was a good experience,  our server could have been a bit more attentive but it won't deter me from letting m friends know about this gem. ",4
 Great dining experience. Band was fabulous.  Service was excellent.  Drinks were perfection. Food was average. But I would definitely go again &amp; try other things on the menu. ,4
" The entrees, side dishes and desserts were all tasty and had their own unique flavor. The salmon was peachy, the grits has Parmesan and the mac&amp;cheese-wow- was the best I've had in a long time. The drinks were a good price and the bartender was always willing to try something new. My party wanted live music while we are and this placed delivered some great covers of soul music. The noise wasn't overpowering and the people who come here seemed to be mostly regulars. And if I were a local, if be coming here again and again as well. ",5
 This is my 4th year celebrating my Birthday at Sweet Georgia's Juke Joint.  The food was not as good as past years but the band was great!  The service was good and my family &amp; friends had a great time.  They need more malbec wine selections on the menu but the two they have were great. ,4
 I enjoyed the music.  Our first waiter was so awesome but he had to leave and then our service was horrible.  The manager was such a sweetheart.  He did check on us periodically and tried to get someone to help us out but we went long periods without assistance. I had to send my Jambalaya pasta back because it was pushy and very salty. I enjoyed the salmon and mashed potatoes and the salmon crochette (spelling) was a disappointment but the ambiance was awesome. ,4
 I can't recommend this place enough. The servers are always great and I've come to believe it's impossible for the kitchen to send out mediocre food. Everything my family has ordered at Sweet Georgia's has been pure perfection. ,5
 You can tell they are trying to pack in a lot of people to see the bands. Your seating in super close to next table. Barely leg room to get through. However food and band were great. Service was ok. She had to many tables spread out. ,4
" The food was good, if not a little bit expensive. For my wife and I the service was so-so. Unfortunately for us, the atmosphere was one that did not seem very welcoming to these who were not local. ",2
" Had to ask waitress multiple times to fill water glasses, ordered drink had to ask for it 3 times and our 3rd party asked for appetizer and never received it.  It was a special occasion and spent 168.00 service should have definetly been better.  Never expect to have to ask for  such things, ",4
" The food was tasty. We had the wing appetizers delicious. One of my girlfriends didn't like the mac and cheese, I did! The meal was great. Turkey burger, sweet potato fries and chicken tenders was what we ordered. The atmosphere was pleasant. The wait staff was knowledgeable and efficient. ",4
" Regardless of whether or not you are there to listen to their live music, every person in your party is charged a $5.00 fee plus every person must also order an entree.  Ridiculous.  I will never go back. ",2
 I always love the food and live music. Would come more often if the drinks were cheaper and cups bigger. Lol ,5
 The food and music were great!  The customer service at the high top tables was a little slow. ,5
 I met a high school buddy in town for a few days.He heard about the Juke  Joint and wanted to go.  We were very impressed.  The service was excellent and the food was great..  I highly recommend this spot.. There were several large groups there when we arrived and I paid close attention to how they were being serviced.  Kudos to the staff... ,5
" We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner.  We had eaten lunch here the day before and decided to return for the live music at dinner.  For lunch I had the fried chicken, collards and mashed potatoes and couldn't help feeling like I was in my momma's kitchen eating a home cooked meal.  For dinner I had the catfish and it was just as delicious. Great food and atmosphere! ",4
 It is a must that we visit Sweet Georgia's Juke Joint every time we're in Atlanta! ,5
 I love this place! ,5
 I took my boyfriend for his BIRTHDAY and it was both our first time coming and we absolutely love it. It was a good vibe good music and great food. ,5
" We went to Sweet Georgia's to celebrate my husband's birthday. I made reservations in advance. We were seated promptly.  Our waitress was attentive and efficient.  The food was really good.  My favorite was the peach cobbler. Lastly, the band was amazing! Overall,   a memorable night. ",5
" This past weekend on our Ladies Trip, we visited Sweet Georgia's Juke Joint. The food and customer service was great, because we had sat a long time we felt kind of rushed to leave. We did gather our things, checked out and left. ",3
 Ok band who did not really engage the crowd... and it was pretty empty even for a Thursday night.  Awesome drinks! Thought $5.00 band fee pp plus having to order an entree was a bit much! ,3
 I took my boyfriend here for his birthday. The live music is what initially made me choose this as the place for dinner. He is very into music and from the time we came in until the time we left he had a smile on his face. The food was truly southern and the Miss Ceely's Moonshine.... lets just say it only takes one. :) Truly a great date night. Service was great and the place was clean. ,4
 First time visit for my family; We had the time of my life.  Awesome place to celebrate a birthday! ,5
" I will be going back the next time am in town. The chicken, mac n cheese, ribs bbq sauce are too die for. Please if you are in the Atlanta area please find your way to the JUKE JOINT you will love it. ",4
 Has reservation for 5 PM on Sunday. Seated promptly. Restaurant about half full. Placed near server station. Waited for server as staff seemed confused about who had our table. Wait staff congregated near our table to wait for order terminal or just to chat. Ribs tender but  dry. Could not taste the sauce on ribs as the sauce nearly burned. Shrimp and grits bland. Collard greens tasty but lukewarm. French fries thick cut with a tasty spice but lukewarm. Large screen showed a Tina Turner concert. ,3
" Staff was very respectful and the service was second to none. The mix of food, music, and relaxed ambiance is perfect for a special evening or just to relax and unwind. ",5
 Noise levels extremely loud. From groups celebrating.   Waiter was good. But  rushed and in a hurry to serve all the people.  Need more servers. So the servers are not  overwhelm. Need more of a personal touch   music was good. Videos  were good. During musicians break ,3
 Food was excellent and so was service.  We had a wonderful time and look forward to returning.  We may try the brunch next time. ,5
" You'll enjoy the things you would expect from a Southern Gem like this. You'll get the skillfully prepared fried green tomatoes, chicken and waffles and other Southern delicacies. All this in a pleasant environment that includes live entertainment! ",4
" Live band was great! Food was good, drinks were a bit over priced ",5
 I recently visited Sweet Georgia for the first time and it was an awesome experience.  Our waiter knew what we needed before we asked. The live  music and performers exceeded our expectations.  We will be visiting again when we return to Atlanta. ,5
" Enjoyed the scene, made a reservation for my girlfriend's birthday.  Service was outstanding and I had no complaints.  Just wish we could have sat closer to the stage! ",4
" In time for brunch, our waitress seemed to lacked customer service skills; her attitude was like we were interrupting her day. Sloppy slow service, forgetting items ordered, my husband's toast, not toast, but two ""wimpy"" untoasted"" pieces of bread. Her attitude was ""whatever"" &amp; didn't cheer up nor change until I ordered bread pudding for my husband; as it was his birthday. His dessert FINALLY arrived &amp; a scoop of ice cream added to cheer us up &amp; erase any feelings of lousiness BEFORE we departed restaurant. Food, so so; lukewarm. In closing, restaurant is over rated, over priced, &amp; having to pay $5.00PP for ""live entertainment?"" Too too... We came a long way to dine at this restaurant &amp; were very disappointed.  We give it a ""D"" ",2
" In Atlanta for a couple of nights and wanted to find a place with a live band.   Concierge suggested Sweet Georgia Brown's and we're so glad he did.   The band was great and the food was good.   If you like jazz and a good meal, Georgia Brown's is it.    Reasonably priced too! ",5
" Our first visit to the Juke Joint was absolutely awesome!  Everything ... from the staff, food and entertainment. ",5
" Valet parked, arrived 30 minutes early prior to reservation.  First band set begins promptly at 7 pm. We were seated 20 minutes ahead of schedule. Great table off to right side of room. Wait staff very attentive drinks arrive glass of wine and draft beer, followed by appetizer of crab cakes very eye-catching and pleasant tasting.  Enjoyed music selections. Food order arrived chicken and waffles was my order and catfish with grits was his order. Quite enjoyable. Second band set begins about 8:15pm.Great music. Overall for couples,friends and family to small work  groups . Restaurant is kid friendly for daytime dining, parents may want to consider entertainment mixed with music and drinks a club atmosphere so leave children home ",4
" Made reservations online. It would be wise to do so, if you want to be seated immediately. The food, service, and entertainment was excellent. keep in mind, $10 valet parking and $5 entertainment fee for the great live music! Artist I saw: Tony Tatum and the Soul Cartel Band! By the way, their moonshine is on point :) ",5
" Seafood gumbo was the best I have ever had. The blackened catfish and grits was so tasty. They may or may not have had cornbread. If they do it's not on the menu, but I think I saw over tables with it. The live music, lighting, and decor were phenomenal. If I lived in Atlanta I'd go once a week at least. ",5
 Nice for date night. The food was great! Not kid friendly though! ,5
" Great Food, Atmosphere and Live Music! It was Independence Day holiday weekend, so the service was a bit slow, but they were really busy! ",4
" Good was better at the airport location. Chicken was hard and over fine and not the Souther fried chicken you'd expect-- chicken fingers with a mix waffle,nothing special. Wasn't a good value. Music was great though. ",3
 The best stone ground grits I ever had in my life!!!! ,5
" I thoroughly enjoyed my experience here. Definitely needed a reservation. Everything I ate here was fab-u-lous... I had the catfish and grits and couldn't have been happier. Good textures and flavors. Had the crawfish tails as the appetizer; also good. Even went for dessert: bread pudding. Packed, noisy, and fully worth the experience. The live band that night covered a Pat Metheny tune, so even my husband, who normally hates noise with dinner, was happy. ",5
" Throughout the dining experience, we felt rushed. I still had half my meal left and my folk in hand and the waiter came to the table and said ""Can I take that plate?""  Five minutes later another waiter asked ""Can I box that for you?""  It was as if they were saying ""Get out of here, we want your table for someone else."" ",3
" Sweet Georgia's Juke Joint is a lively restaurant with a professional and courteous staff. The band was playing, the place was loud but the music was good. I had the blackened catfish which was perfectly prepared. The food was well prepared and since I watch my carbohydrate intake the waitress had no problem substituting vegetables instead of grits. She was very accommodating and attentive to my needs. Make reservations, the place was busy. I had a 7:30 pm reservation and was seated right away unlike some places where you still have to wait even with a reservation. Overall a great place. I was in Atlanta at a convention and will definitely stop in on my next visit. ",5
" Went for Sunday Brunch with my 3 besties and was pleased to find they had live entertainment which was outstanding! Old school Soul/R&amp;B performed at a pleasantly enjoyable level. We could have our conversation and still enjoy the music. This duo was worth the $5 per person ET fee, but I still wish it wasn't mandatory. I also wish our server hadn't been rudely confronted at our table because he served us mimosas 20 minutes early. We ordered different dishes to share and all four of them were absolutely delicious! Unfortunately, we didn't get everything we ordered, and though our server was friendly and professional he was VERY slow and did not follow up even after we asked for him. A hangover perhaps from mimosa-gate. Will go back for 2nds. ",4
" The live music is a great feature! The food was really good, I had the Fried Chicken, Mac and Cheese and Collard Greens. Excellent service. ",4
" I had a reservation at 11:00 and had to stand outside for 15 min while my husband called inside twice for someone to open the door. Finally the Manager came and unlocked the door and walked away,my husband and I just looked at each other. We felt he should have opened the door said hello and apologized for having us stand outside for 15 min.Once we entered he walked away and still did not acknowledge us. I had the shrimp and grits which was delicious but they could cut back on the butter. ",3
" I wanted something local and the Juke Joint delivered. In a world of national chain restaurants, Sweet Georgia's gave me a fair taste of Georgia for my 1 night stay in Atlanta. ",4
" Good food, good service and great entertainment! Nice atmosphere for a date night or to celebrate an occasion. My only complaint is that the dress code should be enforced! Saw guest dining in cut of shorts and shorts and t-shirts. ",5
" We visited on Father's Day.  I made a reservation but had to wait a while for  a table. I am not sure why because there were plenty of open tables when we were seated.  The fried chicken was great.  We did not expect the entertainment, at this early hour, and it was great.  Although, we enjoyed the meal and entertainment the service was very slow. Our waiter seemed new and over his head. We will try again and hopefully the service will be better. ",4
" It was my boyfriend first time there, it was a great hit, he loved it, coming back soon! ",5
" I specifically made reservations on Father's Day at the time I did because William Green Band was performing at noon. At around 12:35, I asked our waiter ""were is the performer"". He said he would go see what was going on. He came back to say he learned William Green Band was not showing and another band was suppose to be showing in 30 minutes.  My complaint with that was they should have announced that their performer was not coming instead of having patrons sitting not knowing anything.  Another downfall for me is you must stick to the breakfast (brunch) menu until 3:00. Most places we go to for brunch,  you can order off the lunch menu as well. Our dish was tasty. We had the Shrimp &amp; Grits. ",3
" My friends and I dined here on Sunday, June 8th for my early birthday celebration. The hostess was friendly and professional. Our server started off ok; however it went down hill from there. We were first to be seated and last to be served our food. Once our food order was finally placed we received our food within minutes. The food was excellent. We expressed to the manager our unhappiness with our service and she made sure we were compensated for the less than exceptional service. I will not allow the service to take away from my experience. I plan to return soon. The ambience was exceptional. Great place...Great Food. We'll see about the service next visit. ",4
" Great environment for special occasion dinner or business meeting, especially if you time it right so you experience the entertainment. ",5
" This was my 7th or 8th visit.  The band was awesome,  the food was delicious (our entire group liked their dishes), and the service was excellent.  I recommend this restaurant for date night, ladies night, and groups! ",5
" Great food, entertainment, ambiance!!  Overall I enjoyed the experience!!  I will definitely be going back!!! ",4
 The dinner menu is awesome. I enjoyed the live band. I have told all my friends about the Juke Joint.  ,4
" Hi, my rating today isn't based on resent visit at the restaurant. Last Sunday, wasn't a good experience for me and my guest. I brought family members who came from Virginia. First, there was no valet parking. We had reservation, and the restaurant didn't seem like they were ready for customers. 3rd our waitress, didn't show up until 30min later. 4. We had to wait for our at least 45 min. And even then we had to get another waiter to get her. Like I said, this is not based on other visits. Overall, er enjoyed the music and atmosphere. The manager took off the entertainment gratuity, but we enjoyed the music it was the SERVICE. ... ",2
" Had a great time, the band was hot and the crowd partied.  Great for out of town guests. ",5
" Excellent live music and atmosphere.  Price reasonably, the time fly having too much fun.  One of Atlanta's Gems. ",5
 My waitress have great recommendations on what to drink and eat. ,5
 I took a party there to celebrate a birthday and it was perfect. The food was awesome as and the music had everyone clapping and dancing. Great spot to hang out with family and friends  ,5
 Tried visiting several times and found it full with long waiting times. Did not know you coukld reserve a table until before last visit. This is great for someone like myself who drives &gt; 35 miles to visit. I will be there more often now. ,4
 The ambiance at Sweet Georgia Juke Joint was great! The live band was wonderful.  My food choices lacked flavor.  The fried chicken was consumed with herbs that hid the seasonings.  I added salt to my other food items.  I would definitely recommend the restaurant to those looking the have drinks and listen to great music. ,3
" Took my husband on a Thursday night for his birthday and he absolutely LOVED it! The food was great, the band was AWESOME and our hostess (Kelly) made us feel right at home! We'll be back!!! ",5
" We went early (6pm) for a quick meal. Didn't know it had a live band starting at 7 (which comes with a mandatory $5/cover charge per person). Bottom line, the food was outstanding. The smoked wings appetizer was some of the best this side of Buffalo's famous Anchor Bar. For a main course, the orange glazed salmon was big enough to feed a small army (16-20 oz) and beautifully prepared. The New Orleans Pasta (a.k.a., jambalaya) had more fresh fish and sausage than I could eat - very well prepared with just enough heat to remind me of Bourbon Street on a late August afternoon. The average wine list had plenty of reasonable ($8-10) selections for most tastes. ",4
 We were celebrating our 1 year anniversary.  It was cozy and romantic.  The band was good.  Our waitress was terrific.  I was too excited to eat.   ,5
" Since the weekends are always booked, I make reservation on a Wednesday night.  Now I know why it is booked on the weekend.  I had a great time and will return during the week. ",4
 The Juke Joint is a great fun place to listen to live music and enjoy some great local food. We always go when in Atlanta. ,5
" We went for dinner on Labour Day weekend (party of 5) and we did not have a good experience. Our appetizer came quickly enough, but we had to wait over an hour for our meal. Our server told us that they were short staffed in the kitchen, all meals were slow, and the majority of the meals that night had come out cold. Although our server was apologetic and competent, it was out of her control. Until the staffing issues and quality control standards are improved, I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. ",2
" My family and I were there on Wednesday at 6:30 for my son's bday. I'm sorry I don't remember our server's name, but he was great!!!  We were sitting near the kitchen. Our apps n meal came at the same time and our server apologized, but no big deal. We also had a slight mistake with one of our meals, but he quickly remedied that as well. It was a great meal and night out for us. Thank you to our server and to Montana's. we will definitely come back again!! ",5
" Service was very very slow, waitress wasn’t very attentive. After our meal she just brought our bill and I was wanting desert so I ordered desert and it wasn’t what I ordered they substituted without asking ( instead of brownies we got ice cream !)  Not sure if I will be back anytime soon . ",2
 The restaurant did not have our reservation on file and were unsure how to handle the online reservation ,3
" Probably our favourite Thunder Bay dining place. Great food; no surprises or disappointments; friendly, casual atmosphere with a generous menu! ",4
 We went on New Year's Eve but had a reservation.  The restaurant was busy however the service was quick and friendly. My husband really enjoyed his steak dinner. My Caesar salad was a little wilted as there was a hot grilled chicken breast on it.  I would recommend the chicken going on the very side of the salad instead of the middle to lessen the wilting. ,4
 Always super friendly staff and very yummy food. ,5
 Our waiter took care of our party of 13 with no issues and made my daughter's 10th Birthday memorable and quite happy. Thanks so much considering it is around Xmas so there were lots of big parties there but he was her attentive to the kids and adults. Thanks Kelseys we will be back!! ,5
 We had a great meal. Server was excellent. Only concern was that in my reservation I said that one of the guests was in a wheel chair. When we got there our table was up a few stairs. Fortunately there were two strong gentlemen in our party who lifted the wheelchair up and down the steps. ,5
 Does not accept Android pay or tap ,3
" Good atmosphere, decent food, and semi-attentive service.  We had to borrow condiments from another table as our waiter forgot them. Good thing because we didn't see him again until we were almost done eating (which would have been just fine with me if it wasn't for the missing ketchup) ",4
 I had mentioned to the hostess and server that we were celebrating a birthday but it was given no attention. Nothing. ,3
 About 30  friends got together  it was a great place to do it . We had our own area and the service was fabulous. Thanks Kelsey's we will be back in November to do it again ,5
 Food and service were both terrible. ,1
" Great great, fast service  &amp; great friendly staff👌👍🏻 ",5
" Always a great place to go for a quiet, romantic dinner. Service is impeccable. ",5
 My girlfriend and I attended the winter special which is a 3 course meal for $41.00.  Each course was delicious  and we could hear others around us with similar comments.  I have been there for dinner before and we always have excellent service. ,5
 We have never been disappointed by the service or the food - always leave here feeling the evening was well worth it. ,5
 Aria was recommended by a co-worker and a friend as a great place to take my IT customer. I did so and we were very impressed with the quality of the food. As always my client eats pasta and loved the shrimp and scallops in cream sauce. He also enjoyed the vegan brownie ( which I later recommended to my vegan yoga clients). I had the veal and scallops dish and substituted with quinoa and it was a very healthy portion that I was able to share some with my customer to try. Very flavourful and delicious. already added it to my Instagram story and many asked where I was - they thought I was in Vegas and were surprised it was in Brampton. Well done Aria! ,5
" Our Christmas luncheon with friends was a great success at Aria. The food was excellent in taste, presentation and price. The service was attentive, but not intrusive, respectful and friendly. The waiters were knowledgeable about ingredients, and helpful to allergy-conscious diners. Our table was perfect for our chatter and gift exchange. We particularly enjoyed the use of purse/bag holders. Thank you . ",5
" Pleasant and comfortable historic home with attentive staff and an interesting menu. The only drawback was the lack of accessibility, which is not mentioned on the website. There are several steps at the entrance, and washrooms are upstairs. ",5
" What an awesome experience! We've never been to this lovely restaurant before-- we're visiting  from Windsor. From the moment we walked in the service was outstanding. The venue itself is a beautiful, restored home. The host, as well as the waiters, were supremely professional, friendly, and well informed, and attentive.   I ordered the seared halibut, and my husband ordered the scallops and veal. Both meals were served piping hot, perfectly prepared, and in generous portions. Best meal we've enjoyed in a long time, and we dine out often, especially my husband who travels weekly for business. We enjoyed a lovely glass of wine with our meal, ordered from an extensive wine list.  We were too full for dessert however the desserts looked amazing. We will make a point to return the next time we are in the area! Would highly recommend. ",5
 Wonderful menu complimented by daily chef specials.  Food was all expertly prepared and beautifully plated.  The complimentary bread was wonderful but it would have been nice if it was served with a herbed butter. ,4
" Excellent dining experience! Lovely atmosphere, amazing service. ",5
 The environment was very nice and our waiter did attend to our needs.  The soup was delicious. We ordered the steak and shrimp special.  There was one grilled shrimp on a large Sirloin.  The meat was cooked perfectly but it was so bland.  It had no taste to it whatsoever.  I would like to return to try the seafood. ,4
" It was great! Food was excellent and the staff were very welcoming. Our 6 year old daughter had a great time, they made her feel special and allowed her to bring out the Birthday treat for her dad. Well done!! ",5
 Went to Aria for my mom's birthday and it was a great experience. The food was delicious and the service was great! ,5
" Loved the baked brie. Good fig and arugula salad; could have benefitted from an additional crunchy green (maybe chard) and candied walnuts. Unforgettable steak taste and preparation. Seasoning on chicken supreme was too light, but mushroom and wild rice saved the day. Unobtrusive yet attentive wait staff. Lighting and noise levels helped create positive atmosphere. ",4
 We returnd to this location for a revisit on our 30th Anniversary. We had our wedding reception at this location when it was known by a different name. I wish we hadn't waited so long! The food was very good (Veal and scallops for me - King Crab for her) done to perfection! Service was good and the desert was complementary (Creme Brulet). Well worth the cost and it was fun to relive the event. ,4
 It was very nice and cozy place with excellent food and service ,5
 Great experience. Food was amazing and our waiter was very friendly and helpful! ,4
" Had an amazing meal, the service was quick and had multiple people give us our drinks, food, appetizers ",5
 Really enjoyed the food and the service was wonderful.  I would go back.   The only thing was the waiter brought the bill without asking.  Right after we ate.    A little off putting but otherwise and wonderful experience at a beautiful restaurant. ,5
 Amazing quality food and excellent service will definitely go back ,5
" It was our first time at Aria, I looked at it many times and didn't go but our cousins came out from England and we decided to give it a try.  The food was excellent everyone was impressed.  The service was superb, heated plates and our waitress waited until we had all finished (a pet peeve of mine when the plates are cleared before everyone has finished eating).  Our waitress Meya was a delight we all loved her.  She was funny without being intrusive and quite made our evening.  Well done Aria we will be back. ",5
 Great service and amazing food! We were seated right away and the service was fast and food was great. Can't wait to try the other items on the menu. ,5
" My waitress was oustanding as usual. I always enjoy my dinner experience here. Usually, evrything is done to perfection. ",4
 Everything was outstanding!  A truly wonderful evening....thank you💕 ,5
" Took my elderly parents and in-law here for an early dinner on Saturday. Service was gracious and professional. Food well cooked and nicely presented. The old house was charming, a welcome change from the chain restaurants and Indian buffets that seem to be the main dining options in Brampton. We were celebrating a birthday and the complementary slice of carrot cake at the end of the meal was a nice touch. I'd certainly return in the future. ",4
" First time to this Bistro.  Great food and great service.   A family of 3 celebrated my birthday.  We had ordered Crab cakes as our appetizer and were amazingly yummy.  We had ordered sea scallops (DELICIOUS), beef penne(very tasty) and Jail Island Salmon (very fresh).  We enjoyed our food very much.   The quality and quatity of the food are equally perfect.  A little bit pricy but worth for any special occasions.  Highly recommend this Bistro.   Thank you to Michael (the owner) and their staff's warmest welcome. ",4
 Amazing food made to perfection. First time and will certainly be back. Service was amazing with a cherry on top. Great place ,5
" Since it was going to be our last luncheon meeting of 2014, thought we would revisit Aria. The Bar was set pretty high, from our initial visit. However, Aria's Staff rose to the challenge.  The entire restaurant was tastefully decked out with Christmas decor and the crackling fireplace made it even cozier.  From the warm welcome at the main entrance, to the fond farewell; truly a memorable dining experience.  Our Host (Ari Y) was very knowledgeable about Wines and 'Food Pairings'. He paid adequate attention to us, without intruding on our special occasion.  The Owner (Michael) stopped by the table to extend his appreciation of our business......Nice touch.  We will definitely return to this Venue, as often as we can. ",5
 Aria is one of the best restaurants in Brampton.  Inspired menu with fresh ingredients and inventive recipes.  The daily specials are interesting and tasty. Nice wine list.  The service is exceptional. ,5
" It was the first time that my wife and I had dined at this restaurant since the change of ownership and we were very impressed by the overall experience.  We felt that our food was prepared to perfection and well priced for the quality received. Minor preference changes to our food combinations did not present a problem and the staff was very accommodating. The service in general was very timely and sensitive to our dining pace while respecting our privacy.  The atmosphere in this restaurant is outstanding with many of the original home's character features preserved, a welcome alternative to the standard ambience of most of our eating establishments these days.  We are looking forward to sharing our next visit with family and friends. ",5
 The food is very tastey and the wait staff is knowledgeable about food and wine. Courses are well paced and the ambience of the old house is elegant. Every visit is a special dining experience.  Happy to support a fantastic restaurant in our own city. ,5
" We had a great time at Aria, when we went for dinner with friends.  Our waitress was terrific, the owner was fun, everyone's food was delicious.  We would definitely go back and we would definitely recommend the restaurant. ",4
" The service was fantastic, our waitress was friendly and attentative, as well as the support staff. My fiance had the filet mignon and I the crusted halibut on risotto. The steak was done perfectly and very tender, the halibut was fantastic, perfectly cooked. The risotto could have been done a tad more, but the flavour was excellent. Portions were perfect. I highly recommend the vanilla ice cream. I would recommend this for any special occasion. ",5
 I booked a table for my boyfriends birthday dinner and we both really enjoyed the evening. The restaurant was decorated very beautifully for Christmas and it really set a romantic mood. ,4
 Be sure to try the warm seafood salad. It was well balanced and grilled perfectly. And the bread pudding is worth the wait. Amazing that the chef is so young. ,5
" The staff was, knowledgeable, passionate and genuine, the food was way above standard considering Bramptons fine dining scene, a must try. ",4
" My husband and I we're looking for a new place to go for date night, and found Aria (as recommended by a friend).   Nice spot - fits the standard format for nice restaurant/old house.   Overall - we had a really nice night, and a good table by the fire (we had to ask for it...they were going to seat us in a less ideal spot.   Highlights - best bread ever, food was good, additional staff was nice, romantic enough.  Lowlights - main server was abrupt and not knowledgable,  couldn't get more butter for that delish bread, weird table in the middle of the room that should be off to the side (used for water pitcher, spare cutlery, etc - constant invasion of our space - buffet against the wall makes more sense) and desserts had a freezer/crystallization to them.  We let owner know about the odd service and he sent over after dinner drinks.   I would go back - but would ask for a different server up front. ",4
" Before taking my girlfriend I saw pictures of what the inside of Aria looked like and they are truly being modest because it doesn't capture even a fraction of it's beauty.    This historic home turned cute and romantic restaurant is the perfect spot to take someone who you're thinking of proposing to, celebrating an anniversary with or want to show how much you appreciate them.  The service was impeccable.  Even though My girlfriend and I got full off of their delicious calamari unfortunately had to get our main courses to go, the staff at Aria were very accommodating.  They always wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves and were very eager to help in any way they could to make our experience that much better.    Thank you Aria for your fantastic service and food, now I know where I want to propose to her. ",5
" Wonderful place, excellent food, great service. It has exceeded our expectations. ",5
" It was a chilly Fall Day, when we stumbled upon this 'Old House'. The Restaurant had just been decorated for Christmas and there was a crackling fire going.  The Menu is different and the Food was fantastic. Yuri, our Waiter was excellent and his recommendation of Wine Pairing with Menu Items was spot on.  We will be back and will take even longer to enjoy lunch. ",5
" From the food, to the service to the atmosphere....top notch! ",4
" From making the reservation to paying the bill and everything in between was excellent.  The server was attentive and answered all of our occasions.  The food was received as ordered, came in a timely manner and was excellent. ",5
" Good dinner experience. Prompt service from friendly waiter. French Onion soup, made the way it should be. Everyone enjoyed prime rib or steak main courses, and variety of dessert selections. Waiter explained ""Billy Miner"" naming of items. ",4
 The server was very engaging  I had the coffee sirloin special and it was deelish! ,4
 My wife and celebrated her retirement at The Keg. Food was very good and the service too. ,4
 Great experience will return. Love the service and the food. My server was exceptional. Good job Narisa. ,5
" The food is always exemplary and our server, Carrie was professional, funny and knowledgeable. ",4
" I want to pass along the following because it's so important we don't always complain. We had a reservation and were kept waiting more than 15 minutes because tables needed ""bussing."" I expressed some mild frustration and girls on front desk were not overly helpful.  However, shortly thereafter the manager came out - asked what was going on (of the staff, but I could hear him) and he simply said ""OK, (name) come with me, we're bussing tables, now."" I was so impressed. He realized there was a service issue and immediately, took personal responsibility to deal with it.  Later, because we were dining with a person who has multiple food allergies, we spoke with the manager who handled our concerns properly, respectfully and helped us to feel good about our choices/safety. The restaurant that night was very crowded and the service was slow. In total we were there more than 45 minutes after our reservation and still had not been served our wine. Normally I would have lost my mind but our server was excellent and the manager was trying…I felt legitimately to resolve issues so we cut everyone some slack. Overall our experience was good but you should know that others that night might not have felt the same care and attention. Had that been our first visit, or the manager not as ""on the ball"" this review would be a whole lot different. ",4
 Our reservation consisted of approximately 20 people along with 3 children between 4 and 7 . The attention with our wait staff was excellent! We were pleased with the little tray of vegetables with dip and orange slices for the children along with the children's menu. Food and drink was delicious ! There was a little bit of a wait for food to arrive at the table but in all everyone enjoyed themselves and we were very pleased with everything! ,5
 There was some incident at the venue and they advised us a bit late about it and to go to another venue. So we ended up not going anywhere. ,1
" Excellent food, amazing staff. Always have an exceptional time going to this Keg. ",5
" The service was fabulous, I believe our server was Teresa. She was very attentive but not overbearing and very cheerful. Steak was just ok, I found mine to be quite tough, especially for a place that specializes in steak. This is my second visit and second time my steak was tough and too chewy. May come back but will not order steak there again. ",4
 JP was a great server...  pleasant and took the time to get to know us without feeling creepy...  will be back soon. ,4
" Excellent steaks, ambience and great staff and waiters ",5
 Food and service consistently fabulous! Cannot go wrong when dining at the Keg. ,5
 Service was a little slow and they weren't that busy. Bread came after the main course as apparently they were in the oven. Otherwise food was great as always. ,4
 I have a fish and seafood allergy - the staff took very good care of me and made sure everything that I order or that came to the table was safe.  It was great.  One issue - the music was way too loud.  We had some difficulty hearing each other. ,4
 Even though the vents were out the night we went (so no steak) we had a great time and the food was amazing.  It actually had us order other items that we not normally order and they were great. ,5
 Was great our waiter was amazing! ,5
 Server started ok then she got busy and service level slipped. We received our bread after we finished apps. I think the restaurant was short staffed in the kitchen it was 60 minutes from the time we placed our order that we received our entree. We did not say anything the manager came to us and apologized and  took the app off the bill. ,4
 Great place to eat. Would recommend anyone to go attend. Waitress was polite and professional and came back to check on us several times but it wasn't overbearing or annoying. ,4
" Amazing service from our waiter.  Great food. The open table app is in accurate, your better off calling the restaurant to make your reservations. ",3
 I have been to the keg 100 time +  always a great experience Amazing food. this time the food was Sensational every thing was cooked to Perfection. They were very busy when I was in yet I still got my order in great time. Thing I loved about this experience from the other times I’ve been to the keg was as soon as I had an empty plate on my table I didn’t have to wait for my server to come back to take it another server walking by took my plate off the table. That is great customer service and keep up the great work you have a customer for life if you keep the great service up thank you to all the staff for the great experience ,5
 Too loud.  Found it hard to hear our conversation. ,4
 Staff was very attentive and went out of their way to address my food allergies.  Food was very good but I find the portions are small for the price. ,4
" Sub par slow service. Steak was ordered medium and came out rare. The server offered to “throw it back on the grill”.  More grilling to a steak that has already been cut in half would have just dried it out. Ridiculous suggestion for a $40 piece of meat, they should have had a new one made. Will not return to this Keg. ",3
 The food was excellent. The server was attentive and we lacked for nothing. ,5
" Hello..we were not seated to our reservation after 45 minutes of checking in,the girl that checked us in noticed that we were not seated,and took upon to seat us immediately, they let ppl waiting for seats saying there was waiting time,when seated we noticed some empty seating in the dining lounge room.We were sent a message saying we did not show up when we did and unconvenced the restaurant  for not showing up so they could fit other customers,we'll they unconvinced us Saturday night 45 minutes seated we had tickets to a play in the downtown core we ended being late..by twenty minutes. .overall service was good..and rushed to eat.. ",4
 Entrees were not hot when served. Everything else was good. Server was excellent. ,4
 Our overall experience this visit was only par. We waited an hour for our dinner. When it came my steak was well done and I asked for medium. They made another steak but we waited for another 1/2 hour for it so I took it to go. There was a back up in the kitchen as there was a party of 40 who ordered before us but weren't told that until 45 minutes of waiting. The manager did comp our drinks which was nice but we went for the dinner and was looking so forward to a mouthwatering Keg steak.  The server was super nice and checked on us frequently. ,3
 For some reason they only had me down for 2 people although my reservation said 4. Wasn't really an issue as we only had to wait 10 mins for our table. ,5
 food was great..atmosphere  was  vibrant..the only downfall was the waitress coming by every five minutes. .. ,4
 The Keg is one of our favourite places for steak and this visit did not disappoint. I highly recommend making a reservation through Open Table as when we arrived with our reservation the wait for a walk-in was 45min to 1hr. Not a huge issue if you don’t mind sitting at the bar though. Service here was also excellent. Can’t wait to go again! ,4
" I had  a really nice experience there for our 3yr anniversary,  but my only real issue was that I'm a vegetarian and there wasn't a selection there was only one entrée. I had to settle for a salad and bread kind of disappointing. As a former carnivore you have plenty of options and I would recommend it to anyone. ",3
" The food was good, but not what I would expect at this pricepoint.  Both the steak and the mushroom cap appetizer were a bit disappointing.  I have certainly had better for the same price.  The service  however,  was excellent. ",3
" We have been there many times, and the food and service is always great! ",5
 Steak is always amazing. Cooked perfectly. Love the warm bread too. Was able to make reservation so didnt have to wait. ,5
" We made a specific reservation request to be seated in a booth in a quiet area of the restaurant.  When we arrived we were shown our table right on the main path amidst very loud families and groups of people. We asked to be moved to a quieter section. We were told that was not an option. So we found a quiet table ourselves in the casual back part of the bar area.  The manager, a man who appeared to be in his thirties with short dark hair and beard with glasses, gave us the most insincere explanation and was quite condescending and rude.  If it was not for our server Ellen, we would have left at that point. Just walked out   The guy was so rude and unaccomodating basically saying we were out of luck despite the reservation. Let me just say Ellen witnessed the entire event and turned the evening around and made it great.  The manager completely deserves reprimanding.  Performance evaluation for sure.  That was customer service at its worst. Ellen deserves a raise and many kudos.   I am more than happy to provide a testimonial for Ellen. ",3
" Meal was delicious,  service was great.   Absolutely no issues whatsoever. ",5
" Our server was amazing It was extremely loud Portion sizes were smaller than usual One steak had to be returned as it was over cooked from request Another steak was very fatty, should have be returned Overall we feel the prices are excessive for the quality etc. No espresso offered Understand we may not fit the demographics you are playing to ",3
 We haven't been to the Keg in a while so we weren't sure what to expect but to our surprise we were greeted graciously and treated like royalty. The dining experience was very well enjoyed and our waiter Mario made sure we were well taken care of. Everyone there was well mannered and always had a smile. Thank you Keg staff ,5
 An overall terrible experience.  A complete disaster all around. ,1
" The Hoovers have done a wonderful job with The Foundry Grillery.  So happy that they have re-opened for lunch because the downtown restaurant options in Lebanon are limited for a business meal.  The venue is cozy, comfortable and beautiful.  The food is always good, the brick oven pizzas are amazing and the wait staff is very prompt and friendly. ",5
" This has been my second visit to Foundry Craft Grillery ; I will definitely make this restaurant a regular go-to and continue to introduce friends to it.   Again, the food was deliciously amazing and presented well on the plate--a feast for both the eyes and the palate.  I had the grilled duck and my husband ordered the coffee-rubbed ribeye; both were great.   Not only is the food something to talk about, but the restaurant interiors are a feast to the eyes too.  From the gorgeously polished bar, the fire grill itself, a bird's eye view of the market below, and the warmly appointed dining room, this place has it happening.  There's plenty of free parking too, that's always a plus. ",5
 Drinks are a little bit pricey but the food was good and priced moderately.  Nice atmosphere and our waiter Logan was good. ,4
 Best burgers in town...hands down. ,5
" Great food; exceptional service.  Our waiter was Logan, and he was very accommodating, courteous, and friendly. ",5
 Something  has changed!  We used to enjoy going to the Foundry but service and quality has really suffered over the past six months.  We are looking for a different restaurant to put in our rotation. ,2
" We just love this place, it’s so relaxing. Food is great and we love all the wait staff. Everyone is always so friendly and they always remember us. ",5
" Hardy anyone was there and it took over 1/2 hour to get our pizza. Why?????  Pizza takes less than 15 minutes to make and prepare. I know because I have a pizza oven at home, and I know all about them. I went to a 3 day wood fire baking school where we made almost anything. The waitress was very pleasant, but did not bother to check back to our table at all during the 1/2 hr. When she did ask us if we want more water when  she brought the pizza; she never brought it ( she did apologize for the pizza taking so long, but she failed to mention why). We came at 6:30PM and left at 8:00PM. We had no desert, and we do not eat extremely slow. Thank you!  God is good all the time; life is hard. Psa 100:5 At least they gave us a $20.00 gift card. ",3
 Girl who seated us was terrible.  Get someone with some smarts and a personality! ,3
 We have eaten here on probably 7 different occasions and the service has always been fair to good but never poor like it was this past Saturday. We had reservations and it took about 20 minutes until we finally had a server. The drink order took another 15 minutes and it wasn’t correct when it finally arrived. It took exactly 1 hour for our appetizer to arrive - and it was a cold beet and cheese dish. Dinner was finally served after 1.5 hrs. The food was good but the overall experience and service was poor. ,2
" I've dined here several times and this was not a good experience. We were seated 30 mins after our reservation and it took at least 10 minutes for our server to even take a drink order from us. Food was very good, as always, but we didn't start eating until an hour and 15 minutes after our original reservation.  I've noticed that when the restaurant is busy, service is lacking.  Not good practice for a joint that charges premium prices. ",1
" Great food, service, ambiance and prices. Highly recommend. ",5
" I really enjoyed  the craft beer, and the food was amazing! Service was prompt, knowledgeable and respectful. ",4
" We really enjoy the Foundry. Gary, the executive chef, has created so many wonderful dishes. The service is always top notch.  I highly recommend for any occasion! ",5
 Hard to find a nicer setting than atop the renovated Farmer's Market.  Bar is one of the most beautiful in the area.  Food is so much better than it was even 6 months ago.  Turing into one of our favorite spots again ,5
 The food and service were great. The ambiance was good but it was very hot in the dining area and that detracted from my ability to fully relax and enjoy the meal. ,4
 Food was well prepared and staff were attentive and helpful. Had a great birthday dinner for my husband. ,5
" I've been disappointed too many times here. Last time was personal pan pizza that had so much oil that the crust was limp and soggy. Their solution was to offer us a free desert. This time my wife and I both ordered filet mignon medium. Her's was perfect, mine was nearly as rare as they come. For an upscale restaurant with upscale pricing and a limited menu to continually get it wrong???  There are too many other choices in our county that do it right for far less money. Burn me once, okay, but then you need to not do it again. May go back, but not in the near future, and not for pizza or filet! Bad experience and a waste of my time and money. ",2
" Loved the decor,  staff was very friendly and engaging.  The food was wonderful. ",5
 Great place. Love the ambiance.  But did have a little trouble finding it.   Its on the third floor. Not familiar with the area. The GPS did not give us any indication as to where it was since it sits back on a parking lot.  But we will go back! ,4
" The Foundry offers great wines at 5 or 7 oz pours - a big plus, which avoids the 2-finger pour that some places pull. Second, the food is delicious, &amp; our server, Brendan, was fantastic! The building itself is gorgeous. Great time with friends. ",5
 The food was very tasty and the service was outstanding! ,5
 This was our second visit.  We have a table of six.   Took about 15 minutes just for a drink order  to be taken.   Even though the restaurant wasn’t completely full service was very slow.   My wife asked for her salmon to be cooked through and it came out almost raw in the middle.   And my friend asked to switch from brussels sprouts to other vegetables and they still gave him Brussels sprouts.    Overall the food is good but we were really disappointed with the service ,3
 We love the foundry. The food is excellent and servers are very nice. It is our favorite lebanon county date night spot. ,5
 Food was good but waitress was never around and was an inconvenience. ,4
" We celebrated with family and had a wonderful evening. The food was good (Swordfish, Shortribs and steak). The wait staff were friendly and very accomodating. As usual, we enjoyed the Foundry.                                                    Willene Koenig ",4
" This is our go to place, we just love the food, hand crafted drinks and the wait staff is so friendly and welcoming. ",5
 We go out with family who share November birthdays. We often pick this restaurant for the tasty mixed drinks and the special menu with no traditional cuisine. We always try something we never had before and have not been disappointed. ,5
" The Foundry turned out to be more than I expected.  The food was great(although, what is up with no bread?) and the ambience was relaxing once we figured out where the entrance was.  Our friends all enjoyed our time there.  Thank you. ",4
" Probably the fifth time I have dined here. I always enjoy the food. This time I was splitting the chicken and kale pesto pizza and having a green salad with the blended Sangiovese/Malbec glass of wine. Service is generally quite good, but demerits tonight for our server waiting after we had settled on a desert choice to inform us it was unavailable. The replacement option of a pecan pie was sub par. ",4
 My kids love watching the staff work in the kitchen with the wood fire oven!  I enjoy the personable staff and the delicious food.  I’ll gladly keep going back! ,5
 It too little while to find out exactly where we were supposed to be seated but after that was figured out we had a great experience. Great food and atmosphere. Service was excellent as well ,4
" First visit and our server was great.  Recommendation to improve: when we arrived for early dinner, we were told our waitress would be out after their meeting was done.  We waited 10 mins to get waiter.  Seems like lack of planning that you would make your guests wait for their reservation. Getting our drinks were also slow. Once we placed our order, it became more timely. ",4
 Big fan of the Foundry....regular visitor and never disappointed! ,5
" Eaten there many times but its been a while.  Had the Caesar chicken salad &amp; was disappointed for the first time ever.  Chicken was not grilled well &amp; seemed chewy &amp; romaine was simply chopped.  In the past, the romaine &amp; chicken were grilled to perfection.  I hope this last time was a fluke &amp; not the new normal. ",4
" Food and customer service was wonderful, there was a slight mix-up with the dinners but it was corrected.  The two steak dinners were given to the wrong customers, new dinners were prepared.  This caused a delay in those two having dinner with the others members of the party.  We were given free desserts and very pleased with our dinners.   This would not prevent me from coming back. ",4
 One person said her beef dish was dry and the music was not dining/relaxing sounds. ,4
 This was our first visit to the Foundry. We had heard good things so decided to try it for our anniversary celebration. We were not disappointed. The food and service was excellent. We will definitely go back. ,4
" This was my first visit to the Foundry.  Glad I made reservations as I don't think we would have gotten a table otherwise.  Food was really good, however, the salad is a bit over-priced.  Everything else was great! ",4
 Arugula never disappoints!! ,5
 Always delicious!  The food is always wonderful and I love the ambiance! ,5
 Excellent food and service. Will definitely go back. I want to try their pizza. ,5
" Aldi did his usual great job with the service, the food was excellent, and the atmosphere was good for talking!! I will be back! ",5
 We were very pleased with our meal! The mushroom appetizer is great!! And we enjoyed the veal entree with fresh veggies and polenta as well as the seafood pasta. Will definitely be back! ,4
" The food was wonderful, and there were many menu options.  However, the service went from adequate to terrible as the evening progressed.  We went for a late seating and the service deteriorated as the restaurant emptied. One would think service would improve! Also the noise level was extreme.  I feel the restaurant is worth trying again to see if the poor service was an isolated instance. ",3
 Loved this gem of a BYO restaurant! ,5
" Every time I come here, I think why don't I come more often?  The ambience inside is ok, it could be a little nicer and the noise level is over the top, however, the service is excellent.  They do not rush you.  The food comes in big portions and is delicious and the prices are what I expect.  It's a great restaurant to have in the area. ",4
 Great spot and I been too many restaurants!!! BYOB great 👍 ,5
 Excellent meal.  We took a lot of time and never felt pressured to leave. ,5
" So fun, great food and environment. ",5
" Most of the service was good (water, food runners, etc.) but our actual waitress was terrible. ",4
" Definitely would have given 5 stars had we not waited AN HOUR past our reservation time...it was a Friday, it was busy, I totally get waiting a few minutes. However the waiting area was totally packed shoulder to shoulder with every party complaining about the wait. They clearly overbooked their reservations, and to me that's not acceptable.  Once we finally got seated an hour later, everything was great. Great service, delicious food and amazing desserts. I've been here before with no issues, so I'll give it another shot. ",4
" Stellar location with excellent food and outstanding service.  Busy, bustling, yet personalized with staff always smiling and engaging.  Nothing gets missed and everyone is treated very nicely.  Favorite spot.  Thank you! ",5
 The staff is young and inexperienced the young man who filled our water glass was the most attentive and the food was so so and somewhat flavorful ,2
 The Grilled Calamari was tasteful and excellent  Unfortunately the entree did not meet expectations. ,3
 Great food and great service ,5
 Excellent! ,5
" Food very strong. We had a variety of their food which ranged from exceptional to average. The meatball appetizer was most creative and tasty, the Gorgonzola salad was delightful, the burrata only fair at best and poorly dressed and the chicken Parmesan very average. The bread was good and the desert looked amazing too. So we will return. That said The service was fair at best, our waiter was a bit arrogant and slow but the auxiliary staff was quite good. Finally the ambience was the worst. They take what could be an interesting venue and create a nondescript, one step removed from a pizza place space with little redeeming quality and Make it worse with a noise level that was ridiculous. ",4
 great BYOB. Been there several times. Always a great meal. ,5
 It was New Years very crowded.  Not their usual menu.  Food good and service excellent.  Did not feel rushed.  Did everything to accommodate us.  Complimentary drink a nice touch. ,4
 Very nice!!! We will be back. ,4
" I’ve been here 3 times in the past 2 weeks with different groups. All were highly pleased with food and service. I’ve tried multiple items on the menu, all equally freshly prepared and delicious. The grilled salmon over sautéed broccoli rabe and pappardelle pasta were my favorite dishes. ",5
" Excellent service with a nice atmosphere. Unfortunately, the noise level is high. However, the food is consistently good. Salads are a bit pricey. We will return. ",4
" Excellent food, as always. Noise level is high but that’s the only downside. Love it ! ",4
 Calamari was excellent &amp; the portion was enough to share. I was able to customize my pasta dish without a problem. The food was delicious. ,5
 Love the food at arugula pasta to brazzino excellent!!  Long hot appetizer was wonderful!  Service is always great. Only negative is noise level but food is worth a visit !!! Will continue to dine there! ,5
 Food is delicious and good prices and Byob is nice option! Love it here! Service is great! ,5
 Very good Italian Restaurant! It's BYOB so that helps keep the outing $'s down. I would definitely go back and would recommend it highly. I had the spinach stuffed chicken breast with a marsala type gravy. It came paired with mashed potatoes as well a vegetable medley. My son had the mushrooms and pasta for a vegetarian Choice. Both were very good. ,5
 Delicious! Good menu choices and something for varied tastes. ,5
" As always, food was beyond delicious and the service was impeccable.  Very nice place to enjoy an evening out.  Highly recommended.  Everything is delicious and served with perfection and class. ",5
 We love bringing friends to Arugula who haven't been yet to see their reaction with the wonderful food and service we have become accustomed to each and every visit.   Look forward to returning soon. ,5
" Great food, surprising to find in this location. Got very loud the more crowded it got and it was really tough having a conversation. ",5
" Dependable, consistent local Italian fare. Nothing is memorable, but everything is solid.  Pricing is a value for portion size.  Outstanding service for a party of eight. We will remain regulars. ",4
 Everything was wonderful! ,5
" My wife and I enjoyed a very tasty lunch, including an antipasto we've never had before - scallops with seared garlic, asparagus, arugula and cannelini beans in a white wine sauce.     We may try to recreate it at home and include it on the menu for Christmas Eve dinner. ",4
 We had four different entrees and we all enjoyed three of four of the  dinners.  The chicken parm was just okay.   The bread and bruschetta at the table were both excellent.  Will probably frequent again but will not get the chicken parm. ,5
 Excellent food and service. ,5
 The food is always so good and fresh at this restaurant! They also have a large variety of specials to choose! ,5
" A wonderful experience. Outstanding food. Spot on service. Glass never empty, plate always cleared in smooth efficiency. Friendly atmosphere. Top notch. Look forward to returning ",5
" Our server Bob (Robert) was really good! He provided excellent service. Bob explained everything, forthright and accommodated our boys’ palates after the Eagles parade!   Lighting changes dramatically after around 4:30pm ",4
 Fun—second time there and well done ,5
 Great time awesome food ,5
" Only one disappointment during an otherwise always great experience. We were seated next to a large family gathering with a less than one year old. Occasional crying, fussing. Capital Grille is not McDonalds. For the cost and expectations, we don't expect that kind of disruption. You go to a restaurant of this level to escape that aggravation. The staff should have placed them in a more private area. ",4
 My grandson and I dined at the Capital Grille.  I had dined at other Capital Grill's so I chose this one while in Philadelphia.  I was not disappointed.  The service and food were exceptional.  Will go there again. ,5
 We were in the back near a very large party. It was Very Loud.  Service was very good. Food was ok. I’ve had better at Capital Grille before. Still love the place ,4
" This is the third or fourth time I have had lunch or dinner at the Capital Grill. Though a chain, it is such a damn good one. The 20 dollar, 3 course lunch is a huge bargain. I had, this time, two small fillet sliders that were perfectly cooked, fabulous truffled french fries, perfectly cooked, and two small deserts: chocolate flowerless cake, which, to be fair, was more like smooth fudge; and a lovely mini-cheese cake, particularly remarkable given I don't usually like cheese cake. My friend had a terrific salmon, avocado, and mango. I am used to eating at very high end, unique restaurants (Laurel in Phila. springs to mind). Sometimes it is nice to just have a first-rate, good old American style lunch.  This was it. ",5
" As always, a great experience. Eric was our server and he was excellent! He was very attentive, asking about our preferences and food allergies. We’ll definitely ask for him next time we’re there! ",5
" My wife and I traveled to Philadelphia with our close friends and traveling companions to see the terracotta soldiers exhibit at the Franklin Institute which was great. We chose the Capital Grille for our dinner destination and were not disappointed, everything was great a true steakhouse experience. ",4
" Good food, personable and efficient staff, very nice place ",4
" We had a very pleasant and attentive server, the food was wonderful as expected, quiet surroundings. One very minor drawback was that while our table was in a corner, an unattractive fire door was right next to us, which was drafty. Not really a big deal, and did not ruin the evening. The whole dining experience was very enjoyable. ",5
" We went during restaurant week which we know is a busy time but we were celebrating my husband's birthday. The restaurant week menu is a steal compared to what prices normally are. With an additional appetizer and drinks, the cost goes up but it's certainly worth it. Our server Rob was amazing and the meal was well timed. We had a difficult table next to us and I commend Robert for his patience! Food was perfect. ",5
 Had a great restaurant week experience. The options on the menu you were diverse and plentiful compared to other restaurants and their menu restrictions. They even had extra options to add on to your meal for a small fee. Our server was nice and very friendly. They also added a few touches to the table to celebrate the birthday of one of us. We were a table of seven and everyone enjoyed their meal. Not a single complaint. ,4
 Had to keep asking several times for things and sometimes we never recieved them. ,3
" I had such a wonderful dining experience at The Capital Grille!  My boyfriend and I were celebrating my 25th birthday, and when we arrived to the table it was decorated with a rose, confetti, and a birthday card from the staff.  Our server, Angelina, was prompt, pleasant, and eager to provide recommendations based on what we were looking to dine on that evening.  At the end of the meal, I was given a complimentary birthday dessert (more than enough for 2 people to share!) and our server happily took care of our valet ticket at our table / added it to our bill to pay with a credit card since we didn't have enough cash on us.  I LOVE The Capital Grille and highly recommend it to celebrate your special occasion! ",5
" Great steaks, the sides were small but very tasty. Staff was at tenrive. ",4
" Very good food and service. The sides weren't very great compared ot the quality of the entree. The green beans were way to crunchy and out table ignored them completely however the bread, salad/soup, mashed potatoes, and steak were amazing. The overall restaurant is very fancy and the servers were very considerate when one of our steaks came out a little undercooked. ",4
 I really enjoyed my meal and services was awesome! ,5
" Great food, excellent service! ",5
 I have been to Capital Grill on numerous occasions. The food is always good and the service is also good. On this occasion we had a very long wait for our reserved time over 1/2 hour. We would not have minded so much but the place was packed and we were on our lunch time from work ( we took an extra hour for lunch and still did not make it back on time). It seemed like they overbooked for some reason and lots of people had to wait. then it felt like we were being rushed. I usually have only good things to say but this time I was a little disappointed. ,3
" Lunch was amazing as usual!! It was restaurant week and a 3 course lunch was only $20.00. It was so, so worth it! Can't wait to go back. ",5
" Our waiter, George was awesome! Even though he is a Steelers fan! We came for restaurant week and The Capital Grille did not disappoint! We will return. ",5
" Amazing food, and the crème brûlée the best I ever had! ",4
 Went there for the first time during Philly's restaurant week. It was date night and this place was on my list of restaurants to try. The food and service was great. Definitely satisfied with the amount of food portions that is served ,5
 You can't beat the meal at The Capital Grill. The lobster bisque is to die for! Steaks are always cooked spot on and the desserts are incredible! ,5
" Capital Grill is one of the best places to go for Philadelphia Restaurant week, well worth the $35 charge for 3 courses including a big, perfectly cooked steak or filet. Thanks CG! ",5
 The place was very nice. The only complaint is that the mwnu selection for restaurant week was too limited. I would come again. But not for restaurant week ,4
 went for restauarant week 5 coworkers -  waiter was extremely pleasant and efficient... food was amazing ,5
" Everything went according to plan, we were seated right at our reservation hour, our waiter Bob was very professional, services was great! The food was delicious! Will defiantly come back!!! ",5
 The food was great and the service was awesome. Waiter was very nice and good. ,5
 I have been to CG before and it is always great. The only problem I had the green beans were a bit hard. But the potatoes and salmon was great. I will go back again with no problem. Great night. ,5
 It was exceptional as expected ,5
 Restaurant week ,5
 I went for the first time during restaurant week.  What a great experience!  We were seated immediately and had a very attentive server.  Our food was timely and the portions were huge.  I did not expect that.  We even had the option to add the lobster for an additional $10.  The meal was well wotth every penny.  It was a great experience. ,5
" Food was ok, the waiter Bob made the experience worth while. ",4
 Great experience. Waiter was very respectful. Although it was “Restaurant Week” the waiter still provided great customer service. ,5
" We went to The Capital Grille for Restaurant Week with friends. The service was excellent. The portions were generous. The atmosphere was elegant, intimate and peaceful.  And the food was delicious.  Perfectly prepared and presented. ",5
" Our server Virginia was great! But I felt cheated by the restaurant itself. I pulled up their restaurant week menu on my phone, but was told that “it was an old menu” and that I would need to pay $10 to get the 28day dry aged kona crusted NY strip. This was listed on their restaurant week menu, and was initially the only reason I chose Capital Grille for restaurant week. My companion’s filet was cooked to medium rare on one side, completely blue raw on the other. ",4
 The staff were very friendly and the food was excellent. ,5
" Food and service were good. The bread was delicious, but the waiter took it off the table without asking if we were still eating it.  I assume it got thrown out. I would have taken it home, since I really get upset about wasting food. ",3
 Love Nectar! It’s our go to place for special occasions and never disappoints! Thank you Nectar for another wonderful anniversary dinner. ,5
" Our experience was great until I realized our server had put my food order in wrong. I ordered from the seasonal specials and read the name of the order and pointed to it as well. Instead of a nice meal, I was brought a sushi roll (after already eating sushi as an appetizer) and thought maybe I misunderstood what I had ordered since it was listed as seasonal and not with the other rolls on the menu. When our server finally came back about 45 minutes after we had received our food, I asked about what I had ordered and she then realized she had given me the wrong item and remembered me pointing to what I wanted. At that point, we had been there a couple hours and were ready to leave. We were offered a complimentary dessert, but needless to say, I left feeling very unsatisfied. ",3
 We go there as a couple or as a family for special occasions. We have never been disappointed . The food is great.  And value is excellent. ,5
" Incredible atmosphere at Nectar and phenomenal, creative food. This combination allows for a great dining experience. ",5
 Nectar always delivers!  Great food and service...highly recommend for any occasion. ,4
 Nectar used to be my go to special occasion restaurant.  The past few times was disappointing.   Is it going downhill?  The food came out so fast I think they must have it precooked.  Our pork Dumplings were cool yet they fell apart as if they were overcooked.  The edamame was delicious.  Our groups 5 entree choices  came out minutes after ordering and were lukewarm.  The sashimi was very good.  Good service from our server but they tried too often to clear our plates.    Overall disappointing. ,3
" Our server was fantastic, but the additional servers who supported our party of 4 were as stellar.  We received a 5-star treatment. It was my daughter's 14th birthday dinner and her surprise dessert was adorable.  A perfect evening! ",5
" Started with calamari and edamame - both were delicious. Then had the king kong roll and a seared tuna roll. The seared tuna roll was perfect; I loved every bite. The king kong roll (lobster and filet) was not my favorite. The pieces of tuna were cut so thick that it was difficult to chew. Would have preferred the pieces to be thinner, which would also make the filet seem more tender as that was also difficult to chew - not sure it was actually filet. Overall was a great experience and staff was on top of their game giving us everything we need without being noticed; which I love! Will be back. ",5
" Food was phenomenal, background music was fun to listen to, and the service was even better! ",5
 Had not been to Nectar in over a year and we were not disappointed. We had forgotten how great it is to have an Asian Fusion high end restaurant in the suburbs  and not have to trek to the city. Looking forward to coming back soon. ,5
 Waited 20min before a server took drink orders. Another 15min to get drinks. Was not  asked for another round of drinks. Over 20min to have plates removed. Was not asked about desserts. Overall terrible experience. Would never recommend or go back ,2
 Everything was basically on point the reason i wouldn’t give it the highest rating is because it a bit tight.  It’s to crowded and the way it’s set up is too in personal ,4
" Met friends we hadn't seen for years.  We all loved our dinners.  The edamame dumplings were delicious as was the wild mushroom pad Thai.  Great for vegetarians.  On our reservation we requested a quiet table and they gave us a perfect spot curtained off, private and quiet.  A great dining experience! ",5
 Sushi was not good. But pad Thai was alright. Very cool atmosphere but seems like an opportunity missed for a great experience. ,3
 Consistently good food and great service ,5
" I didn't know the location was valet only, so I went into a mini-panic because I never carry cash. The valet people were super friendly and funny. Luckily I was able to get couple of dollars for the valet. Kevin our waiter was attentive enough, he came around just enough for us to feel taken care of but not bothered. I had the mango roll, it was good, not the best sushi I've ever had but a lot better then other locations. The drinks were delicious and the desert, mint brownie ice-cream, was okay. Nothing special.   I would describe the atmosphere as cozy and warm. I'd go again to give other items on the menu a try. ",4
 This restaurant never disappoints. We have been a few times now and we are always thrilled with every coarse. ,5
 Always enjoy the food and ambiance but last visit took about 30 minutes to place food and drink order. ,5
 The seasonal roasted pumpkin and avocado roll was absolutely delightful and I hope that they will add it to their full time menu soon; a lovely experience. ,5
 Steak was undercooked ,4
" Love this restaurant we hadn't eaten at Nectar in 3-4 years and made a reservation last minute and met another couple Saturday night . Amazing service from check in at the front desk to the hostess to our incredible waitress . The good was delicious we had 3-4 starters , calamari , tuna tartare , and some others , great wine selection and ambiance . Dinner was delicious we ordered 3-4 dishes and shared . Portions are generous and we ended dinner with a cappuccino and doughnuts for dessert . We will be back ! ",5
 Just skip everything and go straight to the homemade mini cinnamon donuts with dipping sauces for dessert. ,5
" Solid experience, service was a little rushed at first with 4 dishes coming out at once, would have preferred to enjoy the 2 orders of foie gras and then the two orders of pork buns  separately. Foie gras should be enjoyed slowly and then the next course should then follow once we finished. This way the foie doesn’t get cold before you can enjoy It to the fullest. Drinks were excellent, while my Roasted stripe bass was not very good. I was given a free drink as a consolation. I also wound up ordering another order of the foie gras since I was still a tad hungry. Also ordered multiple sushi courses which all were very good. Finished with the donuts. Overall a good experience for New Year’s Eve. With tip the dinner wound up being a 280 dollar meal for two. Only gripe I could say is, that if a customer only takes one bite out of their entree, a free 12 dollar drink isn’t proper consolation over a 28 dollar dish, which was still on the bill. I didn’t want to make a fuss because I enjoyed the experience and wanted to ring in 2018 in a positive way.  Overall I had a good time and will be back, as this is my favorite place to celebrate special occasions. ",4
 New Year’s Eve ,5
" Outstanding food, wonderful service. It was New Year's Eve, so the place was PACKED, and the noise level was high.  But still had a very nice dinner.  Wine list is pricey. ",5
" We were there for dinner on New Year’s Eve. It was crowded and somewhat noisy, but we had a wonderful meal and extraordinary service. Of course, we always have delicious food and excellent service when we dine at Nectar. ",5
 We went to Nectar for New Year's Eve and it was great! We were seated promptly and the service and food were fantastic. Can't wait to go back again! ,5
" Been more than a year since my wife and I last visited Nectar - we will be back a deal sooner next time round.  Quite and exceptional range of food types - more than one expects even in ""Asian fusion"".  We were there early evening on New Year's Eve - the place was very busy.  The wait staff was wonderfully well organized - smooth and very efficient.  The food was very good indeed and we took the opportunity to get away from traditional winter/Holiday food.  Cold dishes and hot were equally good and equally well served. ",4
 Nectar is consistently excellent Portions small but good ,5
" I am a New Yorker and visit Nectar when I am staying in the area. This place is magnificent to say the least! The chef is gifted, the menu and offerings are delicious. All in a vibrant and beautiful space that is pleasing to the eye. It has BIG CITY flare in a small town.  You simply must visit, enjoy, and brag about it. ",5
" Sushi appetizer, amazing; pad Thai, amazing and the mini donut dessert, highly recommend.  This is why Nectar is my favorite Main Line restaurant .... it never disappoints. ",5
" Always an excellent meal, superb service and great cocktails ",5
 Very good Service. Wait staff Friendly. Food very good ,4
 My favorite restaurant. ,5
" Good service, beautiful presentation, excellent food. What's not to like? ",5
 Christmas party (small company!). Delicious! ,5
" First, his holiness the Dalai Lama never said ""Approach love and cooking with reckless abandon."" (Check Snopes) They should remove this from their advertising as it is actually a pretty non-Buddhist thing to say in addition to being false.  On to the food -- it is very good, but not brilliant.  Still, very nice to have in the neighborhood and we go a few times a year, though I think it is overpriced. ",4
" Upscale feel from food, service, ambiance, valet, etc., without being overpriced.  Had a great experience across the board and will be back again for sure. ",4
 I would have given 5 stars but...one glass of scotch $28??? All 4 of us agreed the  food was fabulous. Service was excellent. The cost of the liquor was out of sight in our opinion. Glass of Savignon Blanc was reasonable at $10 so I’d suggest sticking with wine when you go. ,3
 My fiancé and I love Nectar. It never disappoints! Great food and fantastic service. We had Bob as our waiter recently and he went above and beyond to make our dining experience great! Highly recommend dining at Nectar for a date night or night out with friends. ,5
" Always have to have the mushroom soup but my husband tried the artichoke soup and really enjoyed it as well. We both had the gnocchi dish and it was so different and delicious. Complex flavor combinations, truly awesome, may go back soon just for that. Michael and other staff are very professional and knowledgeable. Love this place, always a good time and special ! ",5
" One of the best brunches I've ever had! My in-laws who are local said they would treat us to brunch for my husband's birthday, and based on reviews I'd read, I wanted to try this place out. So glad it didn't disappoint! The atmosphere was charming, and the food was absolutely delicious. The caramelized bacon was all we'd dreamed it would be, and the beignets we had as an appetizer (instead of dessert, with a little prod by our waiter - good call, as we would have been too stuffed by the end of the meal) were scrumptious. Each person enjoyed what they ordered - from my mother-in-law's Eggs Benedict cooked to perfection, the breakfast burger (my daughter loved it but could only eat about a third - it was big!), to my husband's farm omlette, to my french toast with apples and cinnamon (so tasty - especially with some of my daughter's breakfast potatoes on the side, seasoned to perfection). ",5
 The food is always special.  The executive chef is very creative and all ingredients are fresh and many local.  Menu changes regularly which is a good reason to return to Silverspoon. ,5
 We enjoyed the service as well as the food. Very cozy and relaxing atmosphere. We loved it was a byob! ,5
" The service was poor.  Had to ask for bread.  Bread plates came after the bread was eaten.  Did not know who ordered which dish.  For the price, the dishes were mediocre and forgettable. ",3
" Very disappointed. The daily toast with Fig &amp; goat cheese was good, nothing extraordinary. But the charred Broccoli Rabe Salad was so horrible and bitter, no amount of dried cranberries could overpower the bitter taste, I couldn’t choke it down and after 3-4 bites gave up. My fiancé tried it and felt the same. He had the mushroom bisque which was very bland and had to put salt on it to get any flavor out of it, &amp; the Salmon, it was ok, very small, with nothing really to accompany it. I guess if you want a side you should order a few extra courses, as we both left hungry and ready for dinner!! The restaurant and ambiance was cute and clean, but our waiter “hovered”  over us and gave us no privacy at all. ",3
" Enjoyed the new menu.  The salmon with meyer lemon was delicious and different (ate all the lemon pieces), and the short ribs were tender and flavorful .  The Brussel sprouts are wonderful.   Same wish as always, however, that they would control the noise--too hard to hold a conversation (tin roof NOT an asset)--and put some sort of place mat / table cloth on the metal-topped table so that the food does not cool down so fast. ",4
" I've eaten here before and I've enjoyed my meal. Yesterday was very mediocre. The hot water for tea, on a cold day, was not hot. And when we asked for HOT water, the new cup wasn't much better. My salad was nothing special. Broccoli rabe, chickpeas,  with some cranberries and creme fresh. I will find other places to have lunch in the future. ",2
 The food is consistently delicious here. My favorite waiter Michael is always friendly and happy to get you whatever you want. We always enjoy eating here. ,5
 A lovely neighborhood gem in Wayne. This BYOB has some outstanding food and is always a solid performer. This time was their tasting menu on NYE. Excellent and priced just right. ,5
 Another great meal at Silver Spoon on NYE - never disappoints. ,5
" One of our favorites, always a great meal. ",5
" I have been to Silverspoon many times and felt it is only mediocre. But, several weeks ago I had a very good meal at this restaurant. Hopeful that it had improved, I returned last Saturday evening only to find it had reverted to mediocrity.  The restaurant is not a good value even though it's a BYOB.   Too bad. ",2
" we were recommended this restaurant by a friend but we must have hit it on a bad night.  i found the menu to be very limited with similar ingredients being incorporated into many of the meals.  we had a 6:30 reservation and at that time they were already down to one serving of oysters left,  the main meat dish was not available and a lesser cut was offered and the chef had not had time to prepare the 5 course option.   my husbands food came to the table cold and they did replate it and heat it up but at the price we paid that should not have happened. their prices were high, perhaps to make up for it being a byob.  we probably won't be going back. ",2
" Food was delicious and wait staff, especially ""our"" Michael, was on point as usual.  We enjoy introducing our friends to this gem of a restaurant.  Love the owners and chef! ",5
" We love the mushroom soup. Always fabulous. Wish it came with a piece of bread.  Seasonal greens with artichokes with cold chicken difficult on a cold day, but flavorful. ",4
" It's always a pleasure dining here. Not once have i ever complained about this place after my visit. The food is as delicious as I remembered and the staffs are still warm and friendly. Their Mushroom bisque is still as yummy . ^^ Oh how i miss this place. I'm so glad we came here for Xmas eve, and had a wonderful time there catching up with two of my friends. Looking forward to next time! ",5
" Love the people here, and the food is very, very good.  It is small, and fairly noisy as there are all hard surfaces and no sound absorbing ‘material’.  And I am sure there are days when it is quieter.  I would definitely recommend. ",4
" Met up with a friend for brunch. One of the fluffiest omellettes I’ve ever had, delicious! Overall, a warm and friendly environment. Would recommend to others. ",5
 We really enjoyed our date night.  Restaurant is small and nicely decorated.  Relaxing atmosphere.  Waitress welcomed us and explained the menu.  She made recommendations after asking what we liked.  The pork chop entree was excellent and the chicken was stupendous.  The waitress recommended it. I don’t usually order chicken.  The soups were nice.    The panna cotta dessert was divine. ,5
" Unfortunately, we tried for several weeks to dine at Silverspoon and asked some friends to join us, it was there first time, and we were disappointed with the food.  My husband ordered a steak  and it was over cooked. Noise level is very high, could not have a conversation at the small table where we were close. VERY heavy handed on the truffle oil in mushroom soup and fries, did not need to be so overpowering. ",3
" As always, my husband and I were greeted by the lovely owners of the restaurant.  The visit consistently starts out very upbeat  and remains so throughout.  We love the dinners and have brought many of our clients to Silverspoon, but we also cherish the lunch/brunch options. Chicken salad  that is out of this world!  I never order chicken salad out, so this high praise is definitely in order.  Homemade chips and arugula salad - outstanding.  So much more.  The BYOB is a big plus.  Those with wine cellars or decide on an expensive bottle of Champagne can bring and enjoy without a restaurant mark up.  And, no corking fee.     Servers are delightful and aim to please.  I can't think of a better neighborhood gem and will continue to frequent Silverspoon. ",5
" Our group of 5 had 7pm reservations at this great BYOB.  Eugenie was our server, and she took excellent care of us.  She brought us an ice bucket for the white wine.  She was very knowledgeable about the menu, ingredients, and preparation of the dishes. We started by splitting the truffle fries which were delicious. Then, two people had the salmon, one the chicken, one the spaghetti, and I had the strip steak. Everything was cooked perfectly with a lovely presentation. Each one of us finished everything on our plates.  We had room to split the apple bread pudding and the chocolate truffle. The menu does not have that many options, but what is on there is perfection. ",4
 Very nice surprise find in Wayne....very good food and excellent service.  I will go back! ,4
 had pork chops the last two times and they really seem to be great here--very tender yet well (sufficiently) cooked. ,4
" Silverspoon is one of my favorite restaurants, but tonight's dinner was even better than usual. My husband and I chose the $55 5-course tasting menu. Every dish (salmon tartare, soup, pork ban mihn, sseared steak with mushrooms, banana bread with ice creative) was creative and perfectly prepared. My only complaint might be that the portions were too large, as it was difficult to finish 5 courses. It isn't flashy, but Silverspoon is truly a hidden gem on the Mainline, with some of the best food around at a very reasonable price. ",5
 Everything was super delicious. The mushroom soup is one of my favorites. The daily toast was awsome. The saffron spaghetti was was so good and very different. Loved it all. Michael is always a highlight. ,5
 Can highly recommend this restaurant. Menu very creative – delicious food! Excellent chef. Great service ! ,5
" Great meal, charming decor, great friendly service...byob will be back ",5
" Love the ambiance and cheerful and attentive wait-staff.  But the noise level always makes me think twice about coming again.  Also, the food (sandwich and tea) is getting more pricey and less interesting. ",3
" This small restaurant is a neighborhood gem. Love that it is open on Mondays. The food is always innovative and delicious.  I was annoyed on my most recent visit because I made a reservation for a friend’s birthday and when I arrived there were several tables available. I requested a four-top that was a little more private (and less noisy) than the center-room two-tops. The snippy hostess said they had to leave those open in case larger parties “walked-in.”  Then, within 20 minutes, she sat two parties of two at those available four-tops. ",4
" Really enjoyed our lunch here.  The omelet was delicious- fresh and flavorful and the potatoes were delicious (I usually leave them behind - not this time!)  The coffee after was really good, and that isn't often the case when you are a decaf person.  I would highly recommend. ",5
" A second weekday night visit in two weeks, and both were fairly quiet with a few couples and several tables of four sharing wine (BYOB). The seasonal food was great and artistically presented! Artichoke croquettes, strip steak, chicken roulade, and a decadent chocolate truffle dessert are a few of the delicious offerings. A very, very enjoyable place and the waitperson Michael  was helpful, knowledgeable, and very personable too! We will undoubtedly return. ",5
" Great, as always! We love going to silverspoon - the food, service, and ambiance is unparalleled. ",5
 Very good. Done if the best chicken salad I have had. Cute atmosphere. Great for a friends get together lunch. ,5
" We chanced upon this place on my birthday and what an amazing find. The food was good, the service was up to par and the atmosphere was just right. Will visit again when we are in that area. ",5
" Our waitress was wonderful. She was conscientious and kind. When my friend and I shared that we were kindergarten friends having a rare few hours together for brunch, she was gracious and gave us plenty of time to catch up, but she  was also very mindful of assuring that we were attended to. The food was delicious. My only wish is that it were quieter, as the room is small and open-with tables very close together, and the lunch crowd was robust. By far, our waitress was the best part of a very lovely time. I so wish I recalled her name to acknowledge her personally. ",4
" Silverspoon is a Great little jem hidden amongst bigger restaurants in the main line. The food is really good and the byob policy is perfect for wine enthusiasts. It is a little noisy but , such a great spot . ",5
 Second time at the restaurant - amazed yet again.  Being a BYOB just adds to the pleasure ,5
" Michael, our server, was amazing and made for an absolutely wonderful anniversary dinner. We felt completely spoiled by him and look forward to returning, soon. ",5
 Pork appetizer was great. Entrees were nothing special. ,3
 I had not visited La Locanda in a number of years. But I will be back soon. The food was very good. The atmosphere wonderful as was the service.  I am always trying to find a restaurant where you can actually have a conversation without shouting.  And this is one definitely fits the bill.  We had five at our table and we had a great time. ,4
" Friendly, welcoming,  great service, unpretentious, pleasant ambiance, authentic Italian food. ",5
" pasta with garlic and olive oil was disappointing on this visit.  not sure if the olive oil was off or the garlic, but certainly not up to standard ",3
" LaLocanda is truly a neighborhood gem. The service is attentive, the food is delicious, and the atmosphere is lovely and relaxing.  We missed the peppers that used to be served with the bread this time. ",5
 We had a lovely family meal served by friendly and effcient waitress. ,5
" My Fiance and I made a 7:45 dinner reservation, when we arrives there were several patrons waiting inside the door so we proceeded to grab 2 seats that just opened at the bar.  We were at the bar for about 25 minutes when the hostess came over to let us know our table still wasn't ready.  When I told her if it were much longer we might just eat at the bar, she said ""oh why don't you do that, it'll be easier.""  Not sure why I bothered to even secure a reservation...would have been more courteous of her to check on our table.  Won't dine there again. ",1
" Made a reservation for 3 people not thinking it would be a problem to change it to 4 when we arrived. Told hostess (older blonde lady) and her reply was ‘yea, it actually is’. Not sure how many restaurants have 3 person tables and I sure didn’t see any when we were there. So not sure why it was an issue when we sat at a table for 4. Maybe she was having a bad day but she still shouldn’t have said that to me. ",2
 Always great food and service. Favorite of our entire family. ,5
" Fantastic as usual!!!  I went with a few of my friends for the ""Friday lunch buffet"".  The food and assortment were just perfect.  The price cannot be beat.  There was delicious roasted pork, chicken in a mushroom sauce, swordfish, pasta in a cream sauce, breaded mussels with Italian herbs and spices, roasted potatoes, roasted pepper and olives, caesar  salad just to name a few items.   I am not a big dessert person but I decided to try the cannolis and a strawberry cake.  I am so glad I did.  They were out of this world as was everything else we had.  The service is always top notch also.  If you haven't tried this restaurant yet you must very soon.  You will not be disappointed. ",5
" The food was wonderful.  I had the crabcakes, which were basically baked lump crab with subtle seasoning -- no fillers, and not too much salt, as crabcakes often have. My partner had eggplant rollatini, and thought it was fabulous. We were seated by a fireplace, which was charming. The staff are all very friendly and accommodating.  This is the kind of place that makes you feel warm and welcome. ",5
" After years of going to the same restaurant, we decided to try La Locanda.  It was fabulous!  The food was amazing and the service was extraordinary.   Massimo treated us like VIPs.   I really enjoyed my experience at La Locanda and look forward to many visits here. ",5
" They rush you in and rush you out.  If you want a fast, decent meal, this is the place.  But it's not a great value.  Specials are $35 - $40 and drinks are expensive.  So, if you like Italian food, and you want quick, go there!  If you want some time to talk with your friends -- if you want to linger over your meal -- this is not the place.  They'll be clearing your place before you take your last bite! ",2
 All said above. Good food. Great service. Interesting specials. ,5
 Best Italian restaurant in suburban Phila.  Maria and Franco are great owners and always friendly.  Massimo is the Host and always fun and a gentleman. ,5
" Warm and friendly yet respectful decor with tablecloths, table rose and open fireplaces. Many choices on menu. All were pleased and I can vouch for the lemon veal piccata. It was my brother’s birthday and we did lunch. Very nice. ",5
" We were seated in a side room where windows were closed off and a TV (turned fireplace) was all there was to look at.  Even though we had a reservation, the main dining room was packed when we arrived, so we were seated in an area we had never seen before (originally a porch I think).  The usual ambiance was not so good this time, but the food was.   For lunch, we thought it was a bit pricey and we didn't even get offered bread, rolls, etc.  We felt like our table was just an ""extra"" table added to an already busy waiter.  Not our best visit. ",4
" Great food and service. Very accommodating staff, friendly and attentive.  Food was delicious. ",5
" We were a party of 6 out for dinner after a movie.  When we arrived there were very few people there, we had a reservation yet the hostess told us she would see if our table was ready and took a while coming back to seat us.  Service was a bit slow but we entertained ourselves! The food was good, nicely presented and portions generous but not overwhelming.  La Locanda is a  nice local restaurant for a good meal at reasonable prices. We will return. ",4
 Authentic Italian cuisine in a very quiet atmosphere. Our #1 place for Italian dining ,5
 Food was good and people we’re friendly.  Lacked portion size for the vegetables and starches they were also a bit cold. Over not bad. ,3
" Our table was partially situated in a doorway entrance leading  to another dining room. This location was not conducive to an enjoyable dining experience. I swung around the table and sat next to my dear wife. The restaurant was quite crowded which was ok in itself, but it caused the wait staff to rush around during our entire visit. Again, not conducive to enjoyable dining. Bread was delivered by the bus staff with a very small butter serving, we had to request a second serving.The osso buco and fettucine with bolognese were both very tasty, good value. However, I requested a side order of pasta, and received a second entree at full price!    Our waiter was very effecient and polite. He was also serving a table of eight guests next to us which required attention. He was very good we just didn't see him often enough. We'll just chalk this first time experience up to the very busy holiday season, maybe try it again in the spring. ",3
 Always excellent; just wish their drinks were bigger based on the high prices ,5
 Thank you so much for a wonderful graduation celebration. We loved having a private dining room that felt like home. The food and service were amazing. Our waitress was there when we needed her but gave us plenty of time to talk and linger. Couldn’t have imagined it any better! ,5
" Excellent food, great server (Vicky), and a great value! ",5
 It was good. Locals preferred from the staff. ,4
" We had a family meal that showed the consistency of the restaurant ‘s excellent offerings. We had octopus and beef carpaccio, salads, scallops, steak, orechiette, and Dover sole. Nice Chianti and a few good desserts. Everything was very good. ",5
 Crowded for holiday luncheon. ,4
 Waiter forgot our wine that was ordered.  And we had to ask some else ,4
" I've always enjoyed La Locanda.  They have very good, authentic Italian cuisine.  But this week, it was better than ever.  We both had veal tenderloin, with mushrooms, and a Marsala cream sauce.  The sauce was not heavy like many Marsala sauces can be.  It was perfect.  It was served with lightly seasoned scalloped potatoes, and French beans.  We were only there for a quick, week night dinner, so that was it for us, and our gracious waiter didn't make us feel like we should be ordering more than we wanted.  One glass each of a wonderful Montepulciano, and it was a perfect date night with my husband. ",4
 Unfortunately our experience was not good. I was bringing my adult daughter who had never been and we were very disapointed. Hostess did not greet us warmly. We were seated in a room by ourselves and forgotten. I had to find the hostess to ask for someone to take our order. Food was basic and my entree needed flavor and diced chicken made me feel like a toddler. I suggest grilling the breast then only slicing and placing over the orichette. The bread and peppers were the highlight of the meal. Our server did a fine job and the gentleman who poured our water and cleaned the table was a delight. The dessert  we ordered was out of stock and the gelato that we settled for was a sorbet consistency. I was so sad that this was not fun night for us. ,2
 Best grilled veal chops and consistent quality.  Always tastes and friendly staff ,5
" Food was very good; however, we had to wait 40 minutes past our reservation time to be seated. ",3
" We were celebrating a belated anniversary and truly enjoyed ourselves here.   I had the House Specialty (Timballo Di Teramo - Light Crépe Pasta, Layered With a Spinach Omelette &amp; Tiny Meatballs on a Bed of Marinara Sauce, Topped With Besciamella) which was just the right size and so delicious.  My wife enjoyed one of the specials of the day, Veal Ossobusco, full of flavor!  Service by Danielle was right on.    I would say it was one of the nicer Italian restaurants we have been to in quite awhile.  Weekend reservations appear to be mandatory for evening dining.   Christmas decorations are now up which makes the dining area even more inviting!   Superb! ",5
 Awesome experience as usual!!!. Food was fantastic and service impeccable.  Love going here! ,5
 We've  been here many times. Each time we are amazed at the quality of the dishes. I had carpaccio and langostinos. Both were delicious. Highly recommended. ,5
 Buffet was excellent and price was good. Food was fresh and hot. ,5
 Had great dinner and love when they gave the fireplace going- so cozy ! ,5
" We have been to this restaurant quite a few times previously and enjoy it.  This time, the food was not cooked as requested and the chops were over-cooked.  The wine by the glass was quite expensive which is okay if you get a respectable pour.  However, it was about 4 oz. and definitely not worth the price.  I don't remember it being like this previously. ",3
 Always a great meal here. Great her and always fantastic specials. ,4
" Good service, average food. Decor needs a reno. You’re paying for the name, not the experience. Portions were insulting ... yes,  even for tapas standards. ",3
" This was the best meal I have had in a long time. My wife and I dine out once a week and this place excelled in every way. Something happened that took both of us off guard, I don't want to tell what it was but it was part of the best customer service I have ever experienced. ",5
 I have been here at least 6 times in last year. The food and service is excellent ! You will never be disappointed . ,5
 I took a handsome friend out for his birthday. He had never been to Amada. I’ve been a big fan for years. Our server was magnificent and the food was delicious and plated gorgeously. A feast for the eyes as well as the mouth! The bartender made perfect gin martinis for us to my date’s preferences. Ambience was wonderful. ,5
" I enjoyed our meal here very much. It was great tasting food with a modern flair on an authentic menu. You don't think Spanish food in Philly, but this place is great. Coming from a city with great and many choices for Spanish food, I really enjoyed our meal and would certainly come back next time I am in town.   My only negative was the service was ok. It was not bad, but the server may have been overworked as it was hard to get a hold of her at all. ",5
" The food was exceptional, as always, and our server, Karey, was fantastic! She always takes such good care of us anytime we have an opportunity to eat at Amada, and we always ask to be placed with her! You can never go wrong with Amada! Thanks for another great meal and dining experience! ",5
 As always the food and service were outstanding.  Our guest loved Amada. ,5
" I’ve been to Amada twice. Once the week it opened, and once last night. Clearly 10+ years of 200+ covers a night has taken a toll on the place. Service was friendly if not a bit self-important. Ambiance was really lovely and loud and shiny people everywhere. The food however fell flat. Most dishes were uninspired. The roast suckling pig was dry and bland. The standout was the truffled honey served with the manchego. One of our dishes was completely forgotten and when our sweet but harried server brought it out, it was almost ice cold. They proactively comped the dish but the damage was done.  Overall I’m glad Amada exists and will drink at the bar, but will go elsewhere for dinner next time out. ",3
" We were not seated until 8:25, our reservation was at 8pm. The hostess was not nice about my asking why! We were then seated next to the front window which was very cold!   Other than that, everything was great. Food, our waiter, etc. was perfect. ",3
" Amada was an elegant restaurant with many food and drink options.  While the food was fresh, we did expect higher quality in terms of the flavor of the tapas dishes and the portion sizes for vegetarian options.  Similarly, while all the staff were friendly and knowledgeable about the menu, the service was overall poorer than expected, especially in terms of hearing orders correctly and checking on us periodically.  In general, we had a nice dining experience, but definitely expected a higher standard, given the price of the food and the caliber of restaurant. ",3
" Food, service, and pricing are excellent.  You will come back again for sure.  Enjoy Amada! ",5
 Top notch service and food.  Love the tapas style and freedom you have with the menu ,5
 Very expensive for what it is. ,3
" Friends in from DC. Took them to Amada and all of us had a great time. The service at the bar was great, we were seated at a large and comfortable spot by the window. Service at table was super attentive, thoughtful, well-timed (important when ordering multiple small dishes for all to share). They even sent out 3 additional plates not on the menu for us to try. Drinks, wine great. Look forward to going again. ",5
 The food was amazing and very filling! I also noted in my online reservation it was my husbands bday and they brought him out a little desert with a candle on it! ,5
" My wife and I were in town for the weekend and we decided to spend an evening here. We had a wonderful meal, and the white sangria was wonderful. We will be back the next time we’re in Philly. ",5
" We had not been to Amada for a few years, but some friends invited us to join them as a gift to us.  What a wonderful gift!  We all had the chef's tasting, and it was nothing short of spectacular.  We had a total of 11 or 12 small plate courses, and as we drove home we were hard pressed to narrow our list of favorites down.  We enjoyed every bite, and we also enjoyed our drinks (the gin and tonic variations are delicious).  Our server was excellent, and I was particularly impressed with each staff member's command of the menu.  If I were a rich man, I'd eat there 10 times a year!  Can't wait to go back. ",5
" I’ve only eaten here for weekday lunches, and have had good experiences all around. Not so for the Saturday brunch. Everything was off. We had the brunch prix-fixe for $27. Every single item was aggressively salted and oversauced. After I saw the boat size piece of bread that was under the Crab Benedict, I asked to sub plain old rice or potatoes. The chef said no. The green salads were more like soup salad with the excessive amount of dressing. The food was late coming out, staggered oddly with one of us waiting with no food for 7 or 8 minutes. When the Benedict finally arrived, the sauce was congealed and barely warm and had a negligible amount of crab in it. The mushrooms and lobster were so salty as to be barely edible.  We missed our matinee movie because it took 45 minutes to get the food. Inexplicable in a half-full room. The restaurant looked dingy and had a faint smell of spilled beer and old mop. The bathrooms are in need of attention as well. Paint is peeling, and there’s grime built up in the corners. The only bright spot of this meal was the smiling and excellent table bus woman. ",2
 I was a little put off by the quality of the chairs... they were all peeling and coming apart. Something I would have never expected at a date-night type of experience. I highly suggest investing in better chairs for guests ,4
 Restaurant week menu was tiny and was not worth $35 pp ,3
 The selection was varied enough to accommodate all tastes. The food was excellent and portion size was satisfying. Service was good and we were not rushed. We were very pleased with the entire experience and will dine there again. ,4
 we have been to Amada several times.  They  have a great sunday brunch and an interesting and delicious tapas dinner menu.  We will be returning . ,5
" The food was very good, not outstanding. The service was ok, a bit slow and intermittent. It was a work lunch so I didn't have any alcohol but their drink menu looked fantastic, so I'll be back for that. ",4
 Great food and service! Loved the restaurant and selections for Restaurant Week. ,5
 We went for Philadelphia restaurant week and we pressed for time due to Flyers tickets.  Our server was awesome and got us out in 45min with out feeling rushed.  The food was amazing.  First visit but will definitely return! ,5
" My wife and I enjoyed almost all of our shared Restaurant Week lunch choices. The one exception was the not very tasty puff pastry dessert selection: if we could go back and reorder dessert, we would both order the ""egg cream"" cup. ",5
" Made reservations and arrived on time. We were asked to wait at the bar until our table opened up. That's fine and happens from time to time. What we were extremely disappointed with was that we waited for 30+ minutes. We were a party of two... what's the point of reservations? Worse yet, we observed two separate couples walk in after us and sit down before us. Reservations/seating was very poorly managed. Our waiter was also not very prompt or responsive even though it was now later in the evening and the crowd was thinning. Good was good,  but didn't seem as good as usual. Could have been the food itself or our bitterness over the wait. ",2
" My husband and I went for restaurant week. I hadn't been there in quite a while and was really looking forward to it. Some of the dishes on the special menu were very good and some so-so. Our server was excellent. I hate leaving negative reviews but I'm not sure we would return when there are so many other better options. We felt very rushed. We understand it's tapas, that's not the issue. But when there are courses, we expect not for everything to come out right on top of each other. Also, the light fixtures above the tables look like they haven't been cleaned in a very long time and I couldn't get past that. The bathroom is in disrepair as well - toilet seats not connected and no hot water. If there is no attention to detail in the front of the house, what's going on where I can't see? We expected better. Sorry! ",3
 I chose this place for restaurant week so I only had the pleasure of trying the limited menu. But pleasure indeed! The food was flavorful and the atmosphere was pleasant.  I plan on returning to sample the full menu ,5
 Don't be deceived by the small portions.  I went with friends for restaurant week and we each had four small plates plus a very small dessert and yet left very full.  The food was unique and delicious. ,4
 Food came very quickly. Not sure if this is typical because we ate tapas or if it was because it was Restaurant Week. The food that was hot did not stay hot because we were only part of the way through our first course when the rest of the food arrived. Everything was delicious but would have been better served when we were ready to eat it. ,4
 Superb food and service. My brother and I really loved the octopus and when we informed our waitress she told us some additional details on how it was prepared which I really enjoyed. I like hearing special touches like that about the food I am eating. Everything was delicious and the drinks we had were excellent. All of the wait staff were very friendly and kind. ,5
 I enjoyed the ambiance and decor. The food was all very good but nothing blew my mind. I was expecting better due to the positive buzz Amada gets. ,4
 One of the very best restaurants in Philadelphia.  Never disappoints. ,5
 We went with another couple during restaurant week.  Price fixe menu with limited but wonderful choices.  Shared 8 appetizers and 8 main meals.  Enjoyed them all. ,5
" My husband and I heard great things about this restaurant prior to going. Granted we went during restaurant week and that could have influenced the service. Overall experience was just ok. Had to wait for hostess, had to wait for server to acknowledge us, asked for straw, it was dirty and portions were small. Not on the top of our list but would go back one day. ",3
" Finally went during Restaurant Week. Food was awesome although, VERY small plates. None of us left hungry but a bit more for the price would have been welcomed. As always, Jose has a great restaurant in Philly. I'm glad I got there &amp; will be back. ",4
" Amada is one of my favorite places. I rated the way I did because I went for restaurant week and was slightly disappointed in leaving hungry. Usually, regular menu portions are great. Quality was the usual deliciousness that it usually is. ",4
" Good food, good service. Ain't no complaints. ",5
" An enjoyable experience with unique, creative, food presentation that was delicious. It was by chance the Center City restaurant week that was my first time at Amada and the choices were numerous  so that a return trip is a definite. I want to try them all. ",5
 We have enjoyed the Vineyard Wine Bar Restaurant many times and it never disappoints. ,5
" Great menu, food, and wine! Can’t wait to go back. Andrea was awesome. ",5
 My guest and I had a great time celebrating my birthday.  I will be back ,5
" Very nice menu with specials that are always varied and excellent. The night we were there the appetizer special was mussels and they were terrific. The wine list is extensive as you would expect with nice values. The staff is attentive and friendly, it’s a laid back place and good ambiance. We always enjoy a night out there. ",5
" This was my first time visiting from NY, and I had a wonderful time. Thank you for great service and a lovely meal! ",5
 Tried three different menu items and enjoyed them all very much. ,5
" They messed up the reservations and the owner was rude, so we went somewhere else. ",1
 After dinner wine and conversation. ,5
" I have been there a number of times. I like the setting, the food choices and quality. The food is usually very good, unusual choices and the food is priced fairly. But here are areas in which they could improve. This last time we went there it was too cold. We were even located back in the corner in the back of the room and still felt a draft. The food was not hot, in fact, barley warm. I have been drinking wine for over 40 years, I buy all kinds of wine, I have traveled to a number of wine areas. The Vineyard has good wine but only 1 out of 10 is really good enough that it would motivate me to buy a bottle. The one thing that really bugs me is that their pour for the BTG is so, so small. Which makes their wine prices for BTG a poor value. ",2
" We drove to Havre de Grace to look at the Christmas lights, so thought we would dine at the Vinyard. I was lucky to score us a small table in the wine room, but that affected only our ambience score. Our server was delightful, helpful, friendly, there when we needed her and doing other things when we didn't. I especially want to comment on the wild boar over risotto that night. My spouse had an equally delightful fish dish and, if one of us can recall what it was, I will try to modify this review. I really wish that the Vinyard were in Bel Air! ",5
 We enjoyed The Vineyard so much that we made reservations to dine there again next week.  That is a great recommendation! ,5
 We have been to the Vineyard many times and it never fails to please.  The wine list is superb and the wait staff know their wines and have always made the correct recommendations based on our tastes.  We love the small plates and especially the pate platter. ,5
 Excellent small plate meal selections and an extensive wine selection.  Staff is very helpful in choosing a wine to your liking. ,5
 I’ve never been unhappy with my food or wine here.  Always worth it. ,5
" Outstanding wine list with a mega-selection of by the glass and 3oz tasting menu.  Prompt, courteous, and friendly service in a reserved setting which was perfect for quiet conversation in a casual setting.  Great menu! ",4
" The place was amazing! Excellent food and an outstanding wine list!  Staff was knowledgeable about the food, wine and we had some great conversations! ",5
" Their new chef did not disappoint.   Outstanding Wild Boar dish, and nice new flatbread selections.  It was great to be able to compare two (3 ounce) malbec tastings and two rhone tastings and still be able to drive home sober. ",5
" Delicious pâtés,Beaujolais,and a bit of Wild Boar...warm and cozy evening! ",4
 Peruvian potato soup and a salad where excellent. ,4
 We had a wonderful anniversary dinner here.  I had a flatbread and my wife had the meatballs. Both were very delicious.  Loved the small plates as you had enough to eat without being overstuffed. Plus you had room for desserts which were wonderful as well.  Great wine too!  Will be back again! ,5
 we were really impressed with the place the service was  great food good and excellent  wine selection  will visit next time in havre de grace ,5
 Great food and service. Great wine list. Great town. ,5
 I met an old friend to chat up after many months of being away. The server greeted me warmly and asked if I’d prefer to wait for my colleague; I did. She was patient and returned with menus when we were both seated. Then explained the special food and wine offerings in detail. We ordered a bottle of wine and many dishes to share. Everything was delicious. I especially liked the truffle mousse pate and the seared tuna. We had a great night of food and conversation and never felt rushed. ,5
" The Vineyard was lovely, as usual.  We dined with a 93 year friend and initially were disappointed that our reservation was placed at a high table with bar-type stools.  After requesting a table, and a few minutes of consultation between the hostess and another woman (manager)?  we were seated at a regular table. ",4
" Pleasant atmosphere, good food, awesome wine list...althiugh it can be a bit noisy on a busy night ",3
" Nice place for Taps and a huge wine list, even if a bit overpriced. We had a great time over 2 hours picking at food, trying different wines and chatting ",5
" Great food, wine and service My husband and I went for our anniversary Thank you Kimberly ",5
" Great place for a date!  Food was great and shareable, waiter was attentive and helpful. ",4
" The Vineyard Wine Bar is the place to go for a truly memorable experience.  The menu is phenomenal and everything is beautifully presented and absolutely delicious!  The atmosphere is elegant, but very inviting and welcoming.  The wine selection is beyond belief and the staff is so accommodating and extremely knowledgeable.  Can't wait to go back! ",5
 We are always pleased with the meals we get at The Vineyard Wine Bar. Joe ad his team do a great job and the wine selection is great. ,5
" Fabulous wine and small plates in a living room type ambiance!  The beet terrine was beautiful and tasty, as well as the duck breast!  And, oh, the wine/bing cherry ice cream was out of this world!   A real surprise during our visit to Havre de Grace!! ",5
" Really lovely spot, not far off I-95 if you're traveling. Loved the fact that you could get 3-ounce servings of wine. ",5
" Salmon Wellington was EXCELLENT as always. Also, liked the Korean BBQ flatbread. ",5
" Great, huge wine list by the glass .  'tasting' 3 oz sizes lets you try several.  Flat bread is as good as it gets.  Duck was outstanding. ",5
 Quaint little place that we found as we were driving through town.  It was quiet although it was peak lunch time. Good selection of wine.  We shared a caprese salad and a flatbread.  Food was good. Service was good.  I would have given the ambience a higher rating but for a musty smell.  Place needs to be aired out.  But I would go back if I am ever in the area again ,4
" Very good food, excellent service. Will certainly be back again. ",5
" Their pâté plate was excellent, and I will go back and have it again. The wine by the glass selection is very large and perhaps causes the problem that some seemed to have been opened too long ago. Pinots and cabernets are probably quite popular and seem fresh, but a recent red Zinfandel and a Côte de Rhone were kind of stale. Note: I am by no means a wine expert, so take these comments as you wish! ",4
" Fantastic wine selection full of wine makers I had very little experience with and every glass we had was excellent.   The cheese plate starter was fantastic, the olive tapenade flatbread and meatball small plate were just as tasty; the bruschetta not so much.  Do yourself a favor and get the creme brûlée cheesecake, simply awesome. ",4
 Delightful savory nibbles and outstanding wine selections. ,4
" Yum, definitely recommend the Turkey Apple Brie sandwich and the Pastrami and Swiss. ",5
" First time going since new ownership and name change to Lagom.   Was very impressed.   Menu and Wine List expanded, with some of our old favorites (like lamb shank), but with a lot of new dishes, appetizers and expanded wine list.  Went on Thursday night for 1/2 price bottles, and it was a bargain for the quality wine we had.   Food was outstanding, as was our waiter whom kept us updated and made just the right amount of appearances at the table checking on us.   Will be back again! ",5
 Great experience as usual in a classic downtown location ,5
 Good food  Good service. 4 for dinner for a birthday and we all enjoyed the evening ,4
 Food was excellent. The rockfish on risotto was very well done. The service is outstanding and they always offer good food suggestions. Ingredients are always fresh and carefully put together. Definitely will be back. ,5
" Great spot for downtown dining in Havre De Grace, Maryland. Nice portions and parings. Back dining room away from the bar was quiet but a bit cold. ",3
 First time at Laurrapin Grille and it was a real treat.  The food and service were great.  I look forward to going back again soon. ,5
" We always choose Laurrapin for dinner, especially when out of town friends come to visit.  We consider it a place where the food is always great, menu creative and service on the spot. HOWEVER our New Year's Eve dinner was far from any of those things.  The crab cakes were dry and served with cardboard french fries, really?  My Kale salad was awful.  The kale had been cooked somewhat, was not raw, and was tough to cut and chew and a little slimy as if it had been sitting all day.  I expected crisp raw kale.  The beets on the salad were RAW, so I don't know who put this together.  Our guests had the lamb Bosso bucco, and although the lamb shank was delicious and tender, the accompanying vegetables were mush.  What is going on?  Sadly we will have to think twice before going to Laurrapin again....... Probably will, as it has always been a standout, but I'll be cautious. ",3
 We have been dining at this restaurant for several years and we welcome the new chef and the new menu.  Food is great and locally sourced.  The creme brulee and carrot cake were fantastic! ,4
" always a great meal at the Laurrapin, friendly staff and wonderful food.. Love Love Love the Laurrapin ",5
" Disappointing since being under new ownership.  Mussels were bad.  Drink orders were messed up.  Zero effort went into the presentation of the entrees, both of which had their meat temps messed up... They’ve started allowing local artists to hang their artwork on the walls, and offer the work for sale, price tags and all... it’s bad art and it gives what was once a nice restaurant a shifty thrift store/bad coffee house vibe.  Desserts were made by the legendary pastry chef Little Debbie, I’m nearly positive.  Absolutely not worth the money. ",1
 Whole experience was disappointing.  We had eaten here a few years ago and loved it.  Menu was very limited and the crab cake should not be sold in Maryland.  Tasted like the grill and was mushy. ,2
" I have never had a bad meal there .If I want to go local I always go to Laurrapin Grilkekeep up the good work we need quality p,aces to eat ",5
" Upon entering the restaurant, it reeked like an unclean restroom. Service was slow. Prime rib was 60% fat. When I asked for some au jus, the waiter had no idea what I was speaking of and brought me a small container of pan fat. We waited 10 minutes for the waiter to return to the table to take my credit card. Very disappointed birthday celebration for my wife. ",2
 Great birthday brunch/lunch event at Larrapin Grill. Food was great as was the service with knowledgeable staff offering spot-on recommendations when asked for same. Would recommend adding your lunch menu to the websites as some of our party were dubious about whether or not there would be lunch offerings when we made the reservation. ,4
" Every visit exceeds expectation; lamb shank, hmmmm, meat falls off the bone. Good food and nice staff. I keep going back. ",4
" I was here on a business dinner with clients and I was embarrassed at the service and the food! We arrived at 6:15PM and received our first half hour later. We received only of the 2 appetizers we put in which was very unappetizing. Or dinner entrees arrived shortly thereafter which was probably 15 min after the order was placed and they came in COLD! My table order two Prime rib and the server came back saying they ran out and had only one. My table switched the order to rib eye and 2 of the 3 steaks at the table came in cold, blue and all the side were ice cold.  We sent them back but came back rubbery over done and not the same sides as ordered. I will not return or take any more clients there. It was way too embarrassing! ",1
" It was packed the night we were there..and our server was a bit too busy and preoccupied.  The food was good.  Our table was near the kitchen...so combined with an already very loud restaurant...we heard the kitchen staff yelling out what they were cooking the entire time we were dining.   It was fine...but we were, overall, disappointed. ",3
" This restaurant always has locally sourced meat and produce. I've never had a bad entrée there, everything is always great. Service is always great too. ",5
" Laurrapin Grille is an excellent spot to meet a friend for drinks, a casual or more formal meal, or both. The service is attentive and the menu changes with the seasons and I've never been without a good option. ",5
 My risotto was cold. My husband's steak was raw. Over priced.  Would not go back ,2
" Ours was a pre-theater dinner and our first time at the Laurrapin Grille.  The menu selections were interesting and we shared a bowl of PEI mussels in a lemon garlic sauce for our appetizer.    While the mussels were on the small side, they were very tasty and plenty for the both of us. My wife ordered their specialty burger and even though it was cooked more than she ordered, she was delighted with it.  After my taste of it  completely agreed. I was trying to make up my mind between three dishes and our waiter asked if I would trust him to make the selection for me.  I said yes and was happy when he delivered a grilled salmon dish.  It was perfectly cooked and the sweet mustard glaze was tremendous. It was served with roasted Brussels sprouts and vegetable rice.  We didn't have room to order dessert and we will definitely return. ",4
 Met friends there who live in Philly and we drove up from NVA. Perfect for dinner right in the middle. Food was innovative and very good. Especially liked the grilled asparagus with ricotta and egg as well as the eggplant fries. Both delicious. ,4
 Always enjoy the Laurrapin.  Sat in the bar area - enjoyed the live music - not too loud as to drown out conversation - very good.   Delicious food.  Good attentive service - Ashley always does a nice job. ,5
 The food was really good. For the price the meal should have come with a salad and bread. The service was fair and the staff needs training. ,3
" Friendly and accommodating staff, original mixed drinks and an evolving menu make for a very enjoyable evening with or without the kids. ",5
 Enjoyed lunch very much. Perfect portions and nice presentation. Its hard to find a spot where the food doesn't have too much salt or sugar for my taste.  Laurappins was great. ,5
 Always have had an excellent experience at Laurrapin’s - good food good service good beer ,5
 The food was very good and the service was excellent.  The restaurant has several small dining rooms so you can be as close or far away from the bar and music as you desire. ,4
 Our food was really good.  Crab cakes and fries!  Cute place with a good waitress. ,4
" Very good food, great in fact, good beer / drink menu. Great service as well ",5
 Great food/great service.  Totally enjoyable experience. ,5
 Thanks for a great evening! We will be back. It was a fine evening. Is this 50 characters yet? ,4
" pork chop for me...with a mustard potao salad and greens...nice crab cakes, fried green tomato, maque chow [sp?] for my husband,,,good nice server ",4
 Dinner was amazing and the live band was awesome.  Such a fun evening.  Will definitely go back. ,5
" Food was good, but pricey for what was ordered. Our reservation was at 8:00pm and they had sold out of quite a few items at that point. Service was very good. Overall our experience was average. We have had better experiences before and for that reason, we will go back again. ",3
 My husband and I came for our 29th wedding anniversary! The food was outstanding and the service was outstanding ! We love it there! ,5
 We had a great time - the food was delicious and the beverage selection was fantastic! I was visiting the area on a work trip and was recommended to eat here by a friend. Great experience! ,5
 Always a favorite and always a great meal...sustain ,5
 Our party of 4 each ordered the same burger. It was probably the Best burger we've ever had.  Only problem was  One of the air condition vents wasn't working properly and had a terrible odor.  We moved to another table and it was fine. ,5
" Nice place, Busy during my visit. Cool atmosphere, good food, will return! ",5
 My father and I had dinner.  Dad had the pasta and meatballs and I had the sausage and penne pasta.  Both food and service were very good. ,4
 The food was very good and our server was very personable. Restaurant is very clean and their menu has many choices. Our first time and we highly recommend this establishment we will be back. Thank you Don J ,5
 Went with my wife and daughter  Great food. Great ambiance. Attentive service and great waiter. I liked how they showed the different options on an ipad. Great idea. Will be back. Thanks! ,5
 I had a great time on my date. Anthony is probably one of the best waiters I have had in recent time. He was very responsive to my date and me. The food was outstanding. Nice quiet setting. I highly recommend this to friends and family if you are in the area! ,5
 Found a hidden gem in Bear ,4
 Marco's is always a fun place with delicious food and fantastic service. I like the fact that Marco is entertaining. The wine is exquisite and the food is creative. I can always find something that fits my craving because there are so many choices. The specials are always a hit and seeing them on the screen makes them even more tempting. ,5
" The service was timely and friendly - from the hostess, to the servers, to the bussing staff. The menu was extensive with plenty to choose from for southern and northern Italian specialities as well as ""Marco"" creations. I had the veal chop which is the best I have had anywhere throughout the U.S. and Canada, including the ""Little Italy"" sections of many major cities., and the price was not ridiculous like it is in many places. I also had spaghetti with an oil and an abundance of sliced and chopped fresh garlic which was also outstanding.  We also had a Shrimp &amp; Scallop (wrapped in bacon) appetizer with a very balanced Dijon mustard and molasses (or a similar-tasting sweetener) mix. My wife had scalloped veal cutlets with shrimp and crabmeat with a garlic sauce. It was good, but she thought it needed something to give it more flavor which I agreed when I tasted it. It was cooked properly but needed something to give it a little more ""zing."" The next time, and there will be a next time, she would likely get a southern veal dish. She also had marinated asparagus which she said was excellent.   Since we live two hours away and were in Deleware for the night, it is not a place we will get to often (but it would definitely be one if we lived closer), but we will go down that way just to go to Marco's and spend the night. Well done, Marco's! ",5
 Food and service always good. Never had a bad experience. ,4
" Great food, service and ambience. Would recommend Marco's to others ",5
 Okay. We were there early so the service was fine. ,4
" Marco never disappoints.  We were probably the only people there on Valentines Day having a business dinner.  The place was packed yet the service, food, and Marco's personal attention were exceptional, as always.  Wish my business travel brought me to the area more often.  I would make Marco's a once a week outing if I could. ",5
" Went there for Valentines Day.  While the server was very pleasant, over 2 hours for dinner is too long. ",3
 I love this restaurant!! The owner always takes the time to talk to us a chat about good wines he has in stock. He always let's us know of his new specials. ,5
 The food was excellent there was nothing we ate that we didn't like. The service started out okay and fell off somewhere along the way not sure if it was because it was New Year's Eve. But once my husband made a complaint are advertisers came and food came shortly after that. The waitress was apologetic and offered us two free drinks. ,3
 This place never lets me down!! Always great. ,5
 The service was great and the appetizers were delicious. The main course however lacked to live up to our expectations. ,3
 The place had a very good wine list to choose from!!!!! ,5
" Large menu and the chef will mix and match sauces and preparation techniques anything you want for main dishes or sides basically, you don't need a menu, just order anything Italian. I had veal saltimbocca and broccoli rabi. I was wonderful ",5
" Amazing, This is my 10th time back. and I will def. return again. This time I took guest from out of town for a birthday. They are big time foodies and they loved it. ",5
 Veal was not as tender as it has been. It was a little chewy. The pasta sauce was a little greasy. ,2
" 12:30pm on Mothers day, we were there for over an hour, had great food, and had a great time with the family. Stange though, no other customers in the place. Only a dinner menu may be the reason, but we all enjoyed it. ",5
 Grilled romaine salad was great...entrees were okay. I didn't think the sauce had much flavor and portions were small. ,3
 Wonderful food and ambiance. Great place to have a nice quiet dinner. ,5
" Great food, Great staff, Beautiful inside, Def. will be back ",4
" The food was good, but we were placed under a big screen with a music video playing. ",3
" My wife and I took our son and three of his roommates to dinner here on New Year’s Eve. The location was close to the University of Delaware so it cut our travel time after already driving an hour and a half to pickup our son. Restorante Marco was pretty empty on New Year’s Day, but our reservations were at 6:30 PM, which may be a little early for the Bear, DE dining crowd. Our server was fantastic and very attentive. We thought the food was excellent across the six different entrees that we had. I starte with the Tuna Carpaccio,which was spectacular.Overall for us, the restaurant is definitely a keeper as we make frequent treks down to UD.I would highly recommend Marco to other parents look for a good place to eat in and around Newark. ",5
" Our New Year's Eve dinner for 6 was an outstanding. Good friends, great food, wonderful drinks!!! If you haven't tried Marco's, you are missing out!! ",4
 We discovered Marco's about a year ago and thoroughly enjoy our dining experiences there. ,5
" Very solid and tasty Italian fair, with a good variety. Service really shined when we were in Ristorante Marco, the staff was very friendly and attentive without being intrusive. They offered knowledgeable food and drink suggestions, it was obvious they were familiar with the menu. ",4
 My daughter asnd I went to the Wine Dinner. Everything was excellent. Marco went around and talked to all of us. Nothing was ordinary. all was top drawer. Liz ,5
" Restaurant was completely empty on a holiday weekend. Service was ok, but food was a little too salty and portions were small. Probably wont be going back. ",2
 Food is very good but service and overal feel of restaurant are areas that could use improvement. The night we dined there were 2 private functions in the main dining rooms so we were relegated to the tables next to the bar. Those 2 dining areas were cordoned off by sheets hung over wall openings. A little bit tacky adn a bit off putting. Service got better as we dug into our meal. ,3
 You're better off with a Olive Garden. ,1
 Food was good but not great. I had chicken parm and my partner had the seafood manicotti. Parm was good but nothing to rave about. Coating on chicken was mushy vs. crispy although sauce was good. After tasting my friends dish I he got the better of the two dishes. Service was very good and we will try restaurant again. ,4
" Excellent fresh food and value!  Thanks, Bluestone! ",5
 Great food and attentivness.  Health menu  options. ,5
" The server took the credit card and the bill and did not reappear for about 20 minutes.  I had to find someone to get her as she was no where around.  Finally the manager arrived to tell me the server had “lost” the card somehow and they had 5 people looking for it.  I was not happy.  The manager said he would comp the dinner, which was very nice of him but did not solve my missing card.  Finally another server came out with the card saying it had been in the folder in back of something and no one saw it.  Losing a customer’s credit card is very careless and while the manager did apologize, the server never came back.   We visit this restaurant frequently and have not had problems before so I do hope this incident was a one time thing and the server will be more careful in the future. ",3
 Fantastic food and drinks. Service was excellent. ,5
 Nice appetizer good sandwich be back soon ,5
" Consistently good quality.   Considering it was restaurant week, I was impressed but the offerings.  Food and service were both very good.  I just find the ambience a bit sterile and corporate looking. ",5
 Had a great experience during restaurant week.  Food was great. ,5
 My friend &amp; I came for Rest week &amp; loved it. Both said we'd come back. All our dishes were tasty &amp; our food came out v. quickly. Great value for lunch for Rest Wk. ,5
" Food was great... service was terrific ....the server could tell that we were catching up- old friends , and she waited until we let her know we were ready to order. ",5
" ""I love the relaxed feel of this place – like a comfortable home dining room. I definitely would return to try more dishes. The crab cake was amazing and the steak  was great. ",5
 Excellent service and seating with reservations! Food is  fantastic and many choices offered for Baltimore county week. Will definitely dine again! ,5
" We really enjoy Bluestone, so much so that it's become our regular, nearby ""go-to"" restaurant. ",4
" Met a friend for lunch and was surprised how crowded it was. As our excellent waiter, Chris, explained, it was restaurant week. Choices were good, and food was plentiful. Chris went out of his way to be accommodating, even to change an order for my friend after he had already put it in. I had the shrimp wrap and was only going to eat 1/2 of it, except it was so good, I managed to eat the whole thing. Nice size shrimp, decent tomatoes (especially for the winter), and tasty dressing. ",5
" From the Maitre D' right down to the busboy, the service was excellent; even accommodating my request for a different table than the one I was originally assigned for this special birthday with a special friend. The affordably priced 2 tiered, 2 course Restaurant Week menu was varied and imaginative while offering their traditional a la carte menu as well.  While this was not my first visit, it was my first Restaurant Week venue with Bluestone and it turned out to be a wonderful choice. ",5
" We were delighted to be seated on the porch – it is such a quiet spot to enjoy a leisurely lunch.  My girlfriend and I were pleased with the extensive menu offered for Restaurant Week.  Our server, Samantha, was a delight – attentive and friendly. We both enjoyed the Bluestone – a very crisp salad topped with warm brown sugar bacon, pecans, tomatoes dressed with mustard and honey dressing.  Our main course was the Gulf Shrimp Tacos – 3 small tortillas loaded with fried shrimp topped with a tri-colored pepper salsa and served with a cilantro puree, mango mole and feta cheese on the side.  Everything was so fresh and delicious.  Thank you for participating in Restaurant Week. ",5
" Old co-workers get together.  We all ordered from the Restaurant Week menu.  It was really a good deal, two courses for $15.00.  Everyone was pleased with their meals.  Waitress was good, but busy with a lot of tables.  We sat talking for a long time, and the staff did not hurry us along. ",5
 Great service! Very professional and attentive staff.  The portion sizes are just right.  Would definitely come back again! ,4
" It was restaurant week but because it was Sunday at lunch time we didn't qualify. Four of us shared the calamari which was good. The cream of crab soup was not very good, not fine dining, that's for sure. The crab and spinach dip should have been better. The chips with it were excellent though. ",4
" The waiter was so personable,  friendly and attentive.  His warm smile and conversation  meant alot to our 97 year old mother as we celebrated her birthday. ",5
" My sister and I went here to celebrate my birthday last weekend.  This was both of our first times at the restaurant.  The decor and ambiance of the restaurant is nice.  The level of service wasn't good; neither of the two servers checked on us during the meal to see if everything was satisfactory and/or if we needed anything additional (prior to receiving our dessert).  I ordered the chicken dish (2 pieces of grilled chicken breast, with mashed potatoes and green beans); the chicken was pretty good and the side items were just okay.  My sister order the veggie stir-fry which she stated was just okay.  Though we weren't completely satisfied with our first visit, we both stated that we probably would give it another try, based on the decor and the ambiance. ",3
 Food excellent.  Service outstanding. ,5
 Everything was perfect. We can't wait to go back again. ,5
" We go to Bluestone every year for our anniversary, we actually had our wedding reception there. The food is always amazing, we never have a single complaint about that! This trip, the service was terrible. Once we got our meals the waiter never even came back until he finally saw we were sitting there waiting. When he came back he put the check on the table and said he would be back for it. Meanwhile, we hadn't had a single drink refill the entire time. We love love love this place, its dear to our hearts... but some of the servers are going to need to get it together. ",3
" Our table was ready when we arrived. The staff was friendly, outgoing, courteous and very accommodating.  Our waitress, Heather, was personable and seemed to enjoy her job. The food was excellent. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. ",5
" I heard nothing but great things about this restaurant and anticipated having a wonderful meal. Boy was I in for a big let down. The occasion restaurant week to sample some good seafood at a reasonable price. The first letdown, we were seated in the very last booth in a dark and extremely cold seating. There was a huge space heater that was only felt once it was almost touching our legs. Due to the crowd there was no sense in asking for another seat. The appetizer was ok, fried green tomatoes. Our entree was horrible not only was it not seasoned well but my mahi mahi was to have a pineapple salsa. I saw maybe a sliver of red pepper and two pieces of pineapple. There were 2 blackened shrimp that looked like they were blackened the day before. My companion ordered a dish that had scallops, shrimp, and a crab cake. Long story short the scallops were a joke but the crab cake was ok considering. Finally to add insult the meal was cold 10 minutes after arriving at the table because it was so frigid. That could also be part of the reason the food was  distasteful. ",1
 Restaurant week - but menu is reasonably priced so this wasn't really necessary.  Outstanding food and very good service.  Well worth the visit! ,5
" Great, as usual! ",5
" Always very good food, a regular go to place for ne ",5
" Superior service, food and bright atmosphere with the rare addition of low noise at lunch. ",5
" Enjoyed a wonderful meal with friends.  We had Ocean and Gulf and the Cold Water Salmon, it was prepared with care, the presentation was great and tasted fabulous. Will be going back again soon. ",4
 The waitress kept forgetting everything we asked for and even things she offered us...we asked for a kids menu never got one .she asked us if we wanted bread and we said yes and never received it and then when it was time for our checks someone else gave us our check and took our payments. We barely seen our waitress and she barely came over to see if we were ok or how the food was . ,2
 Excellent service and great food. Crisfield stew is excellent. Crabcakes are good but expensive. Only negative is the noise level. They need better sound absorbing panels. ,5
 Quite pleasant and enjoyable. ,5
 The new sunday Brunch and pre fix meal is outstanding....Went for restaurant week and found out they are going to do it every week.  The seafood platter was the best and the Brussel sprouts are superb. ,5
" food was good, server was very nice and cordial.  It seemed that getting our food took a long time and we were one of the first tables there for the day. Beet salad had disappointing amount of beets and i felt misled by the title of the salad.  It should have been called a salad with beets. ",3
 Awesome place i have been there twice back to back days and planing to come back again.  One word  CRABCAKES ,5
" Great food, great service and fun atmosphere!  The Brussels sprouts were delicious! ",5
" Creme of crab soup excellent Bosch and blue salad excellent  Crab cakes, scallops, shrimp excellent Saffron rice was uninspired...will substitute next time Server: Darius (sp?) was top notch Drinks were tasty but weak ",4
 We went for restaurant week and had a delicious meal.  No complaints whatsoever. ,5
" We picked Bluestone because they were listed in the Restaurant Week list and their menu sounded really good.   (And sometimes it's nice to go somewhere it's easy to park.)  We did the three course menu, which is available on certain weekdays all year. My husband thought the crab soup was fair, but I loved my beet and goat cheese salad.  I don't normally get dessert because I don't have much of a sweet tooth, but I was pleasantly surprised by the creme brulee.   It's not a place I need to get back to right away, but I think we will certainly go again. ",4
 Only one employee—bartender—serving all tables. If this is typical I wouldn’t recommend for pre-theatre dining. Food also not quite as good as previous time  we were there last year. ,3
 Mahi tacos and mushroom tacos were amazing.  Crab guacamole is spectacular.  Mark handled our party of 6 with grace and poise.  Will absolutely return! ,5
 We stood at the check in station for the host to greet us. The bartender kept yelling for the host to come out who spent more time in the kitchen than out front addressing the customers. We were literally the first diners of the evening with just a few bar patrons so it wasn’t like they were busy. The host/waiter was somewhat attentive once were were seated but again spent more time in the back taking/filling takeout  orders we presumed. Overall not enough to get us back there for an overpriced Mexican cuisine. ,3
 Crab-stuffed peppers are EVERYTHING!!! So glad they are back! ,5
 The best items on the menu over the last two years was removed for new menu. ,3
 The food was so-so.  I was expecting it to be much higher quality. ,2
 Delicious food and a great atmosphere!! This is our go to restaurant before we go to a show in the city! Every time we have dined here it was wonderful! ,5
" Restaurant has gone downhill. Used to love the food but it has slipped. The salsa  was watery and tasted like bland tomato sauce, the meat from the carne asada  was cold and had to be sent back to be reheated. Enough said. Won’t return. ",1
" We were so excited when the restaurant reopened as this is one of our favorites. We went the week they opened and were surprised at the much smaller menu, but the food was good. We went back tonight and the place was almost empty. The wonderful bartender, Lorraine, was the only employee working front of the house and she did a superhuman job! We never felt rushed, she was professional and charming, and made accommodations for the food as we needed. She is a gem!! I do miss the old menu. We can get fajitas anywhere. Where is the molcajete?? That was our absolute favorite and go-to dinner, and one we craved regularly. We enjoyed the paella, another dish no one else does. Please reconsider expanding the menu to bring back some dishes that made Cucina Lolo stand out from the other run of the mill restaurants. Also, please have vegetarian and vegan options available. I know the kitchen can make accommodations, but it also helps to have real starters and dishes available off the menu. But do NOT let Lorraine go! Her sangria is fabulous (and I make my own, so I know whereof I speak!). Her Some Like It Hot margarita is just inspired! ",5
 Great margaritas and crab guacamole. Several Vegetarian friendly options. ,4
" Mexican cuisine, rather unique and very tasty . Good value for the price. I service excellent. ",5
" The entrees we selected were delicious. Well-prepared and well-presented. The wine we selected was an excellent choice. Recommend saving room for the chocolate pudding for dessert. The staff is friendly, courteous and accommodating. Miranda provided excellent service. She met each of our requests. I recommend reserving a booth or table as the seating area is small. Cocino Lolo is the Wilmington area's best Mexican restaurant. ",5
 Crab guac is amazing!  Mahi tacos also  delish and served as a generous portion.  Great spot for dinner before a show at the Queen. ,5
" Food and ambiance was great, unfortunately was not impressed with our waitress.  She had 2 tables and was minimally attentive and unpleasant. ",4
" When the restaurant closed for the summer, I suspected it was due to slow business. I was fond of it once and kept trying back, hoping that it would get its spark back. No one seemed to care about the place when I was there last spring. Then I read what was said to the press, which was that the restaurant would renovate and revamp its menu when it opened in the fall. I went there optimistic. Absolutely nothing has changed in the look, and the food is the same, only less inspired. And it’s super stingy with the queso fresco! I will not be giving this place another chance. I understand that the Sikoras are putting their energy into their Kennett restaurant, which is very lively. I am not sure why they bothered to re-open. The neglect is apparent. ",2
" Good food, lovely ambience.  We had guacamole for starters- pretty good.  Then mushrooms quesadillas and chicken fajitas.   The waitress was attentive but we waited awhile for our entrees. Luckily we had allowed sufficient time for our event nearby at the Queen and ended up having about time.  Overall, pretty good place! ",5
" Great spot, great food, great drinks.  Service excellent as was food. ",5
 Glad that Cocina Lolo has reopened!  You were missed. ,4
" This is their first week open after closing for the summer.  It wasn’t as amazing as we remembered. Food was warm, not hot, and chips were VERY salty (though our server told us she asked the kitchen to back off of the salt!).  Our server was great. Margaritas were awesome. And the chocolate pudding was as perfect as ever!  Cucina Lolo has been one of our favorites and we expect it will continue to be. Oh, and the crab guacamole was delicious! ",4
 Seems like the restaurant is going through some growing pains. My favorite item on the menu- Grilled Shrimp- is gone. The portion size for the burrito bowl is way smaller. And the tortilla soup is no bueno. Really hoping they will turn around soon and have some type of Opening Celebration! First night back was disappointing with the lack of the famous $2 taco. :-( ,3
" Been a dozen times. Our favorite spot in Wilmington. Everything is wonderful but favorites include the raw tuna ""dice"" (poke), pork shoulder tacos, and the churros. ",5
 Food was good but small portions ,4
" We've eaten here 4-5 times and never been disappointed. It's not the grooviest location - the block is otherwise empty and you have to park around the corner - but it doesn't matter once you're inside. Great service, creative menu and the margaritas are made from scratch - no mixes, and no rail tequila. The only item that hasn't knocked my socks off was the mole. Not terrible or anything - I just have a different flavor (more chocolate-y and spicy) in mind. You'll need reservations on weekends. Check it out! ",5
" Food was great, but when we walked in no one greeted us and we just stood there for 5 minutes. Once we were seated it took about 10 minutes to just get our drink order.  Overall experience was OK, I'm not sure that I would go out of my way to return. ",3
" Food was good, drinks were great!! Service was good though when it gets busy the wait is a bit longer . ",4
 The food here is delicious. This was our 2nd time. Both before a concert at the Queen. Perfect combo ,5
" First things first -- the guacamole was exceptional, and nearly worth the trip by itself!  The wait staff were very helpful and friendly, the restaurant was clean and comfortable, and the food was wonderful.  The margaritas were fabulous, too.   It's an hour from our house, but we will definitely be returning! ",5
" My experience here was just okay. My fiance ordered tuna ceviche, which he enjoyed, and we shared an exotic mushroom fundido appetizer which was also good, though very salty. For my entree, I ordered the roasted vegetable enchilada, which I was very disappointed with, as it was really nothing but red and green bell peppers in an enchilada. I was expecting more variety. Maybe a little bit of onion, at the very least. My blood orange margarita was excellent, however. Overall, I thought I paid too much for what I got. If I were to ever go again, I'd stick with the small plates and ignore the entrees. ",4
" Delicious food and drinks, especially the margaritas and guacamole! We love trying new food every time we come and we are never disappointed. ",5
" Horrible host. Rudest we've ever experienced. Will never go back. Wouldn't seat us in a booth which we requested yet all booths remained empty the entire time we were there. Drinks arrived 25 minutes after ordering. Waitress was lovely but had to keep apologizing for slow bar service. Food was good but hard to enjoy due to overall bad experience. We love La Fia and Merchant but this place is a disaster. Oh! And we made a reservation via Open table for 7:30 and arrived at 7:20 yet received a rude voicemail from same host at 7:50 that we never showed up for our reservation and ""do you know how busy we are?! We have 200 reservations tonight -it's cinco de mayo!"" No wonder so many tables and seats at bar were vacant. And to add insult to injury, open table contacted me today (day after res) and said we didn't show up! Nice work, Lolo. 👏🏼 ",1
 I had lunch with two former work colleagues. The food was excellent and the waiter was friendly and efficient. ,4
" We had a early dinner before attending a concert so the dining room wasn't full and was pretty quiet. We shared a chopped Mexican salad which was very good and large enough for 2. We both had enchiladas (1 roasted veg, 1 chicken) which were excellent. We asked for wine recommendations to go with our entrees and were both pleased with what the bartender suggested. Desserts were also very good. We've been there before and we'll be back. ",5
 Came out with another couple and we had a great experience. The food was some of the best Mexican I think I've had. ,5
 Great meal and drinks. ,4
" Lolo probably had the best and largest selection of all the restaurants taking part in City Restaurant week. I always get the same thing when I come here, but decided to try something different for the value. I had the tuna dice as an appetizer -- it was FANTASTIC. The flavor was spot on and I was sad when it was over.  I do hope the portion is larger on the regular menu because it was quite small.  I had the fried flounder tacos for my entrée. They were cooked perfectly -crunchy on the outside, soft inside, with an amazing sauce on top that complimented the fish perfectly. Again, it was very small. But definitely enjoyed everything! Service was a bit lacking, but they were understaffed and the restaurant was full so it's understandable. ",5
 Lovely meal for Restuarant week!!! Everything was fantastic! Get there for amazing creative menu! ,5
" Prickly pear margaritas are always perfect to start! Love the quac, mushroom fundito, tuna, and enchiladas. Lindsay is the best server. ",5
" we ate here before a concert across the street at world live cafe - food was great, service was very good, and everyone involved liked the meal a lot.  too bad we live about an hour away, but i expect we'll eat here whenever we find ourselves in the area! ",5
" The food and drinks are always great. Usually, the service is, too, but our server the night we visited was not terribly attentive. I wish she'd come around slightly more quickly to take our order after taking the drink order and then handle our check. Also, unless it's the only clean plate left in the kitchen, it would be nice not to have one with a big chip in it. ",4
" Upscale Mexican cuisine with a variety of top-shelf Margaritas. A substantial menu offering with good portioned appetizers and small plates, along with main entrees.  Reasonably priced. Validated parking available around corner. ",5
" Service was poor, the food was typical bar food Wich was a same. I had very high hope for Timothy's. The menu look really promising. Crab dip was not lump it was mesh and a off setting color brown. The crab Skillet fries tasted like store bought frozen fries with a sauce that tastes like mustard. Bacon cheddar stuffed burger one step above something from Burger King. Date told server when ordering no onions on her french dip. But when it arrived ( by the manager) he put it on the table and left before discovering this. I had to take it myself back to him after waiting 10 min for the server to come check on our meal. Two good thing amazing sweet potato waffle fries and the dipping sauce very tasty, beer served in a chilled glass. This one the other hand is not a good enough reason to try again. ",1
" Good food, great service - we are regulars here because our family of 6 (and and visiting friends) with many different tastes can find something they like ",5
 Very quiet for weekend friends get together. They have amazing onion rings and large burgers. Salads are very large  and freshly made . They have a good selection of beers and drinks. ,5
 Food and service were great! It was cold in the restaurant though. There should be an inner door/entry to create a buffer between the entrance and the dining area. ,4
 Our go to standard when visiting the Wilmington Riverfront. Always a good meal and good service. ,4
 We wanted a nice restaurant to go to after a play.   It has a nice selections on their menu so even a picky person can find something they would like and wonderful location.  The waitstaff is wonderful. ,5
" We used your restaurant for the Thanksgiving buffet. The soups were not good. I would suggest a holiday type soup, like an Italian wedding soup for this occasion. Too many things on the table with pumpkin spice. I would have like to have seen a little more variety on the dessert table as well. ",3
" Our group was there on Sun evening before a show on Market St. It was not terribly crowded. We were seated promptly.  Our server, Nikki, greeted us with a smile. She was patient while we chatted instead of looking over the menu. Separate checks were no problem.  Our food came out as requested; I had substituted my side and it was correct.  Nikki refilled drinks &amp; was personable. The food was good pub food.  We'll come here again. ",4
 Family has been there twice and food and service has been great for multiple tastes and age groups. ,5
" Timothy's was a pleasant, casual dining experience ",4
 Great food and craft beer selections. Good size portions . Great service. Beautiful location and pet friendly patio too. Thanks. ,5
 The food was great. Our server was very attentive and nice. Can't wait to come back! ,5
" While they have some good ideas for menu items, they aren't executed well. Service was EXTREMELY slow considering there were only about 20 customers in the whole building.  The one positive is that the outdoor area was very nice and relaxing. ",3
 Really fun and so glad we could bring our dog !!  We sat outside and enjoyed the view. Food delicious and served on time. Waitress friendly and helpful. We will be back! ,5
 The food was good. Hostess was terrible. We had reservations. It took awhile for the hostess to show up at the door and then she was concerned with seating a large party who came in after us who did not have reservations. She seated us once and then asked us to move.   Poor management. I will not be back nor will I recommend Timothy's unless huge changes are made. The only good thing I can say is our waiter was very good ,2
 Waiter (Jeffrey) seemed new.  Food was typical pub food.  Nothing original or creative. ,3
 It was okay good place to watch a game not to take a girl on a date ,3
" Lunch was enjoyable, and I would recommend to friends for lunch. ",3
 Hoping for nice dining on the riverfront. Restaurant wasn't the cleanest. Food was industry frozen items ... nothing to rave about. Disappointed ,2
" I would say my experience there was mediocre at best.  The food was ok, but nothing to write home about.  The server was a little off and we continually had to ask for utensils as our party arrived (seems pretty basic item to provide).     Not a place I would recommend. ",3
 Overall a good experience.  I was disappointed that we dined during happy hour however the waitress said that happy hour only applied to people at the bar.  Thought this was odd since almost everwhere else I've dined you get the happy hr. pricing at tables or bar seating. ,3
" My boyfriend and I enjoyed everything except the service. Although it was Valentine's day, I didn't enjoy the service. ",4
 Went there for Pre-Valentine's Day and service and food was EXCELLENT.  I've been back several times for takeout (shrimp &amp; crab gumbo) and still not disappointed. ,5
 My overall dining experience at Timothy's was great. There was not a wait to be seated and our waitress was attentive to us. ,5
" Very disappointing. Menu, food, atmosphere all very blah. Server was good, tried hard, give her credit, but couldn't make up for what ended up being a poor experience overall. We were seated near the front, and every time the door opened, were treated to a blast of frigid air, very unpleasant...wore my coat the whole time ",2
" We made a reservation for NYE and hoping to take in the fireworks at 9 PM; I should have realized something was not up to par when I was able to make a late week reservation. The restaurant was not crowded, many open seats and therefore we were able to have a great dinner conversation since we weren't fighting too much noise. We did the NYE option which included soup, salad, entree and dessert. The food arrival was not well timed, salads came out with meal. The food was good but not great although our friends noted that their dishes were really good. Our meals came out just around 9 PM therefore missed the fireworks. Our waitress was very friendly but a bit overwhelmed with the number of tables she had; bar drinks were offered refills however non-bar drinks were not. Enjoying the evening with our friends made the dinner worth while. ",3
 Always a great experience. ,5
 Slow service... repeat of orders on food.  Wasn't an enjoyable experience on New Year's Eve as expected... both family and myself very disappointed. ,1
" Great location, good food and wonderful service.  Prices were in line with other like establishments in the area. ",4
 Great lunch with friends.  The service was excellent and the food delicious ,5
 Very noisy as the radio blares in the dining room and then we were seated near some very loud women diners! The food was very average. Nothing very exciting.  Service adequate but not exceptional. Not sure we will return! ,3
" Night out before a ball game and this is pretty much the only place we knew to go and eat.  The food is okay, nothing special.  My Caesar salad with chicken was not that good.  My wife's ribs were good, I ate most of them the next day.  Nacho's and my sons cheese steak were good.   The pasta dishes didn't seem to excite those that had them and my other son didn't feel well afterwards.   For the cost per person that night, it again was okay.  We go once or twice a year pretty much before a ball game but I think next time we'll see if we can find another place, getting tired of average food. ",3
 we sat at a table outdoors--had a great waitress and a wonderful birthday celebration! no many people around so it was quiet and beautiful to look over at the river ,5
 I chose Timothy's for my birthday Delightful as it was last year too.  I'm coming back with a large group that I recommended in Sept ,5
 Wonderful meal! Incredibly large portions. The crab skillet fries are to die for. ,5
" Sat outdoor. My salad was freshly made and the crab fries were in abundance and good. To die for, was the cucumber martini... Great drink!  Good service and my party was seated promptly.  I'm not from Delaware, but will be back. ",3
 The restaurant was dirty and hot. Cobwebs hanging from the window sill and a dead spider was smushed on the wall. Dead bugs littered the floor around the window sill. Pizza was terrible! Sauce tasted like tin. I was ill immediately after eating one bite. First and only time I have ever sent food back. Was truly disappointed since the location demands better quality. Will not go back ,1
" Went for the all you can eat crab legs. There was 2 in our party eating them. Was upset after the second  order came out that our server told us they were running out of crab legs and would not be able to replenish our order. She managed to sneak 1 more order in before they completely 86d them. Manager did give us a 20% off our bill, but being a night out for my husband and i, I was a little upset that we had to stop bc of a lack or error in by the kitchen. What did have, was and our server was making sure to apologize the inconvenience (which was not her fault) and kept our 6 year old happy extra pickles! We will be back, but hopefully will be able to sit ans eat more then the few orders we had this time. ",5
 really  good  food  ans   service   especially  our  server  noah ,5
 The food was a mixed bag.   I met my folks for a belated Father's Day lunch.   I had a salmon salad that was excellent but the crab cake and nachos left much to be desired.  I wish I liked it more. Wilmington is a halfway point for my folks and I to meet. We won't be returning. We'll try another place along the waterfront. ,3
" Very good as always, best fried ice cream and custom mixed drinks in town !!! ",5
" Our server was friendly, personable, attentive and educated in menu and able to communicate such.  We did not feel rushed.   We sat comfortably in a booth....Soooo love a booth/table seat.... Enjoyed Freshly prepared food...Love the goat cheese guac and salsa and chips.... Love the decor,  lizards, vases, lighting...and dinnerware...clear and blue rimmed heavy glasses.... (could have used a little more water delivery to the table....but honestly, we are heavy water drinkers - so average diner may not have noticed)  easy to park and access - street is nicely manicured with upgrades to nearby buildings.    Next time that we're in - I'll take pics to upload....now that I know this survey is available and  photo uploads can be included.     Thank you ~ ",5
" Great fun, good server and excellent food. Wonderful to see a mix of folks in center city on a Friday night ",4
 Always a delight! We make a point to eat at El Sol every time we come to Harrisburg. Love the Orange Mango mojo to! ,5
" The service was very good as well as the food was great. I appreciated the reimbursement from the Chestnut street parking, $5. ",5
 My food was great!  My husband’s fajitas were bland and not seasoned well.  Service was bad.  Server was not friendly and seemed bothered being there. ,3
" El Sol is my goto restaurant when having business associates staying in the downtown area. It's usually possible to get a table for 3-6 people, while still not being empty. The staff is courteous and the cuisine is very good and well prepared. The meals come quickly, but not too quickly. ",4
" My favorite Mexican restaurant.  Can't get out of my pulled pork burrito rut, they are delicious. Been going there for years.  Always good food and good service, and the cocktails aren't bad either. ",5
" Great authentic Mexican food.  We had a great server, too (Fernando)... ",5
 Excellent service and food quality with easy parking in the rear. ,5
" The restaurant has a nice ambiance, good food, great service, and the pricing is very fair.   This would be a nice place to have a late dinner before going out downtown. ",5
" I have been to El Sol a few other times and really enjoyed it.  I suggested we go here for a together with friends. When my sister opened her menu, there was a used straw stuck to the inside of the menu. The table felt sticky, dirty, and there was food left on the table. They were not super busy but maybe understaffed? Our server was not very attentive, the food was mediocre on this particular evening, and our server seemed very rushed. I will give it another shot based off of my previous experiences but had this been my first time there I would not go back. ",3
" Menu has a wide variety of Authentic Mexican dishes so it can be hard to decide. The service has always been very good and the food is served very timely and hot. If you like full flavor, spicy or creative dishes you will be sure to find something. Great margaritas and other specialty drinks. Reasonably priced and ample servings. I would recommend reservations, especially during the lunch and dinner hours because it tends to get busy.   One thing I would recommend to share at your table is the chips and salsa ....you get a large bowl of chips and you can chose four of the different salsa/dips for your chips. ",5
" The food was great, the service was good until near the end where our waiter was apparently trying to get us to leave faster. We only stayed a few minutes past the last person finished their meal. The waiter stopped by five times in that small window and there weren't people waiting for our table. ",4
" I took my 15 year old son with me to dinner, he wanted to go someplace special.  He was blown away by the decor and the ambiance.  He went with the waitress ' recommendation and loved it.  He's a picky eater but even tried the cactus without issue.   Leaving, he said it was ""his new favorite place in Harrisburg"".        I already knew it was great and once again - they didn't let me down. ",5
 Food was very average at best.  My entree was overcooked and the sides were just eh.  Highlight was the chips and salsa.  Very overpriced compared to the food quality. ,3
 Have eaten here only twice recently... Each time the food is nutrient dense yet extremely flavorful! Really enjoy the grilled salad and also the grilled romaine and salmon... Had fantastic service each time with Fernando and Johnson! Would go back again absolutely! ,5
 Reservations through Open Table were erased the night I went for dinner. We had to wait for table to become available. Dining room was completely filled and service was slow as a result. The food was excellent. ,5
" Though entrees were flavorful, El Sol has ""missed it"" on their Salsa and Pico de Gallo. As for the Salsa, if you added some Romano cheese, Angel Hair, and a couple of meatballs you'd have ""Italian.""  Straight up tomato base-poor effort.  The Pico had no flavor; looked as if it should be served with Italian Flat Bread.   Sorry, not even in the ballpark thus disappointing. ",4
" I am not a huge fan of Mexican food in general, but this place is phenomenal!  If I could eat Mexican food here all the time, then I would have to say I love it.  The food is fresh, perfectly prepared, so flavorful, and in a great atmosphere. ",5
" I really enjoyed dining at El Sol. The drinks were delicious and our food was also well prepared. I wish chips and salsa were complimentary, which is why I did not give it the highest rating. The chips were basic and the salsa didn't really taste fresh and was nothing special. Certainly not worth paying $4.00 for. However, overall everyone should give it a try! ",4
" Started with the salsa sampler; the salsa &amp; spicy sour cream were good, the pico de gallo was just ok, and the guacamole could have used less tomato &amp; filler and more avocado.   The tacos were good; we had the mahi mahi and sampler of chicken, carnitas, and chorizo. The chorizo was on point.   The margaritas with Anejo was perfect, ",4
 Overall it was a fine restaurant. Not the best Mexican I ever had but decent quality of food and reasonably priced. ,3
 I had the Molecajeta mixto.   It was delicious as always and since I took half home I got to enjoy it again the next day. My margarita on the rocks was also good.  Very cozy and colorful decor. One of my favorite restaurants ,5
 This is still one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in the area! I love that it is located in downtown Harrisburg! The staff is always friendly and the food is always great! ,5
" This is a lovely little gem hidden in Harrisburg! The food was DIVINE. The service was wonderful. It’s smaller than I expected it to be but it is a lovely, cozy dinner spot that I would recommmend to anyone. I cannot wait to go back to try more food and a margarita.  I will return here again and again! ",5
 The food and the service was great and also the ambiance. ,5
" Amazing quality of food, drinks &amp; service! Best meal in a long time! ",5
 We had a wonderful dinner.  The service was great - our server was attentive and very pleasant. Will recommend to friends and family and I will return again!   Thank you! ,5
" I had never had a problem at El Sol until yesterday. The person that sat us didn’t realize this was a reservation and I was marked as a no-show. I called the restaurant and they rectified the situation, but it put a damper on my experience. I would definitely go back. Our waiter was great. ",3
" Food was delicious and fresh. I love Mexican and Hispanic foods, to some I may seem like a snob when it comes to the quality I expect when I order from this genre, ( I am Hispanic born and raised ). El Sol definitely met my expectations with the food and the cocktails.  I was there with my hubby and another couple for dinner, no one left disappointed. Atmosphere is cozy and yet vibrant, service is friendly and timely. ",4
" Overall our experience at El Sol was great.  However, for the second time they did not have our reservation correct. In the future I'll print the confirmation and take it with me. ",4
 Everything was great and the service was wonderful. ,5
 Absolutely fantastic food and service! Easy walk from City Island. Excellent margarita! ,5
" It was ok, servers are always awesome. Food for the price is not amazing but we only ordered fajitas and some kids items. We should have done more authentic Mexican fare. They do have the best quacamole on the planet! ",4
 Aways a wonderful experience at El Sol! The food is delicious and the service is great. Our party of four each had something different and everyone was so happy with their food. I ordered the Tacos Camerones special which came with a bean salad and a bit of guacamole that was just terrific! ,5
" Found this while traveling through Harrisburg area with good recommendation on trip advisor. Food was excellent. Service was good. The table was very roomy. Five dollar parking was covered half of the bill. It's a shame they don't have room for extra outdoor tables, they only had two. Just limitation in space. ",5
" Food is very fresh, the margaritas were perfect and great atmosphere. This was a dinner out with three friends. We had an order of guacamole and chips, with three dinners the grilled fish tacos, crane asada tacos and filet medallions. Only issue was the server. Very nice and friendly, but he lingered around making you feel rushed. When we were ready to place our order he wasn't prepared. At the end of our meal we ordered dessert and he kept pushing after dinner drinks. With a different server would have given more stars. ",3
 Good food and service. Lunch time was very busy. Not ideal location for a date but it was ok. ,3
 We love it there food is excellent and service is second to none highly recommend EL SOL for authentic mexican cuisine ,5
" I like Nectar, it sits and fits very nicely to my taste. The food some time is a suspect but most of the time it is good. I would always recommend my friends and family to go there. ",4
 Just a great mix of scene and great food.  My favorite restaurant on the mainline if not in the entire area. ,4
" Our service was exceptional! Our waiter overheard me wishing a happy birthday to my boyfriend, without me asking, he brought over a Chocolate Mousse dessert with a candle in it (for free). Also, my boyfriend was disappointed with his meal (not because it was bad but because it wasn't the way he expected)it was still great and he ate a little. The waiter asked if everything was alright with it and he just shared how he expected it to be more of a meat dish instead of lo mein noodles. The waiter took it off the bill without hesitation. It was completely unneccessary considering the meal was just fine! Their service is exceptional and we will absolutely return!! ",5
 I loved this place.  I went there for Mother's Day and couldn't believe how kid-friendly it was.  I saw a lot of children there.  Their sushi is great! ,4
 great experience. wonderful service. beautiful restaurant ,4
" Excellent food, terrific exotic drinks modern decor.  lots of groups, so it is noisy but in a fun happy way. ",5
 Bar is very small and congested ,3
 Cute date spot! Check out my full review here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/nectar-berwyn#hrid:zRj0tpvdpEUiimDAqeBeSw ,3
" The food was great, ambience ad service were wonderful.  I had the free range chicken.  My companion had the sushi and we split the dumplings - all were excellent. ",4
" If you are looking for a great meal with a hip crowd and atmosphere but don't want to travel into the city, then this place will fit the bill. ",5
 This has quickly become our new favorite ,4
" The service and food were good.  However, it wasn't nearly as good as I had been expecting given the other Solomonov restaurants.  I would go back because everything was tasty but menu variation and flavors were not that exciting. ",4
" Awesome...third time and every experience lives up to the last. The service is absolutely the best, Sarah this time, Allison last time. Both women are knowledgeable, have a sense a humor, &amp; are attentive without being intrusive. Sarah kindly brought Chef Yehuda Sichel out to say hello and let us compliment him.  Our friends drove up and back from the shore just to dine  there based on our accolades and they loved it and agreed it was worth the trip.  We love the foods’ rich flavors and unique take on comfort food. The attention to detail is what makes each dish special, like the pumpernickel bread pudding croutons that have to be made every day.  The butter with chicken fat whipped in to make an air concoction topped with teensy crispy chicken skin. It’s just all remarkable and genius. And with a company philosophy of doing good, (check out Rooster Soup) it makes spending money on a meal out feel worthwhile. ",5
" Everything about it was great.  Sarah was our waitress and she was outstanding.   She clearly loves where she works, and she took great care of us.  She selected the food for us, and everything we had was amazing.  Very fun night.  Grateful for the experience. ",5
" Abe Fisher is a favorite in our household.  A combination of an incredibly creative menu, fantastic flavors, and a fantastic staff.  I have never had a bad experience there - indeed - always only spectacular.  One tip - if you're not REALLY hungry, you  might be better off ordering maybe 4 dishes for 2 people a la carte - the food is super satisfying.  And  you can always order more!  Also - their signature cocktail (the Abe Fisher) is totally unexpected, and freaking fantastic.    Oh - one last note - I normally only go with adult friends - this last time, my son joined the party.  He's 10, and the food is a little intimidating at first glance - the waitstaff was incredible at helping us (and him) end up with a fantastic meal, and even try some new and exciting things. ",5
" Extraordinary good food! Great specialty cocktails! Outstanding and charming service. Our waitress rocks - charming, fun, knowledgeable about the menu. 2nd time she has been there for us. My favorite restaurant in the Free World. ",5
" Lovely evening out and about in the City of Brotherly Love and Sisterly Affection.  We took advantage of the last weekend of Philly's Restaurant Week to try Abe Fisher, a restaurant we had heard about but never tried.  Thanks to Restaurant Week, we did!  Chef Yehudi Sichel actually came over to our table to make sure everything was to our liking (it was!) and that was a lovely touch to meet the actual chef.  Abe Fisher was not on my restaurant ""radar"" but I would definitely try it again. ",5
" We had a great time, thank you. Good food and good service. ",5
" Food and services was outstanding.  Did not realize in advance that Abe Fisher served small plates.  What both my wife and I selected were more than enough, very tasty as well as interestingly prepared. ",5
" No one offered to take our coats. The food was ok, a bit heavy and not at all fine dining mixed in with comfort food. Overall, the wine list was subpar and their signature dish didn’t live up to the hype. As much as we love Zahav, this restaurant disappointed. ",2
" Delicious food. A modern taken on many classic dishes. Every dish was spot-on. Loved the chicken liver mousse, sweet potatoes, veal tacos, cheese blitz...bacon and egg cream dessert is unlike anything I've had before. ",5
" We had a great time. Our server, Sarah, was excellent, as were the others who came to our table. Food was creative and great. Unly drawback, couldn't hear ourselves talk. ",4
 My husband and I went for Restaurant Week and thoroughly enjoyed the food. All of the dishes were excellent but we particularly loved the range of flavors in the sweet potato appetizer. The service was efficient and friendly. The noise level is loud so you can't expect to have an intimate conversation. ,5
 Portions are small even for tapas-style. Very good quality though. ,4
" Great food, as always. Nothing too special for restaurant week though - same 3 course menu but $35 instead of $39, so not really a great deal and menu no different than the usual. Overall though, great food, great service, but don't know that this will be one that I rush back to for restaurant week next time. ",4
" Celebrating a birthday our meals were just delicious.  When you pick there is plenty to share, rockfish, salmon and tacos were amazing, the sauces complimented the protein.    Must have the egg cream dessert for any chocolate lovers paired with a french press coffee.  Service was the perfect pace, we were not rushing and our server could not have been any more accommodating. ",5
" Everything was good, except some of the food came out lukewarm and my drink was very bitter but good.  The food was very gourmet and we ended up getting the restaurant week menu which was worth the price, but overall some of the flavors weren't really exciting.  I would recommend this restaurant to a group of friends to try and hang out, but the price point is a little high outside of restaurant week.  I would want to go back and try their regular menu.  The chicken liver mousse was great, however the borscht tartare wasn't what we were expecting. ",4
" We really enjoyed Abe Fisher! We went for restaurant week but it sounds like you can get a similar experience for just a little extra during the rest of the year as well. Some highlights- the latkes, brussel sprouts, and the chicken. All were so good!! Also not to be missed are the schnitzel tacos. We went with four people and everything that came out had about four bites on it, so I wish we had coordinated better to each get something different, so we could all share and taste more things. The three plates option was definitely enough food, even though at the beginning the plates seemed small. Would definitely go back. ",5
 Restaurant Week. ,4
" Great take on Jewish cuisine - much better x10 than your traditional Seder or high holiday fare, can’t wait to return! ",5
" Elevated twist on Jewish fare. My cousin and I tried it out during restaurant week and it did not disappoint! Between the two of us we picked six different dishes and they were all delicious. We especially loved the veal schnitzel tacos (so tender and flavorful), bacon and egg cream (just try it), and pumpkin honey cake (we need the recipe). ",5
" A fun environment; creative menu with very good unusual dishes; VERY noisy.  While I would recommend it to some people, not to other seniors who may have some hearing issues and/or would prefer to be able to converse with others at their table. ",4
 We went with friends for Restaurant Week 3 course dinner. Each dish was more delicious than the last one. Glad they didn't make you have dessert as part of the three courses. Would highly recommend the restaurant0 ,5
 We loved the food.  Interesting dishes and well prepared.  The schnitzel tacos were certainly unique.  This is the restaurant who want to go to Zahav but didn't think to make reservations 3 months in advance. ,4
 Went for Restaurant Week with a friend who had never been to AF. We both loved it. Everything was so good. Portions were more than adequate. And a big round of applause for whoever came up with such a clever way to prepare food. ,5
" Delicious dinner, but our server tricked us into the ($30 more per person) option for dinner (during Restaurant Week). Sneaky and not cool. She made it seem like the $35 and $65 options were the same....which, obviously they weren't... just a little more honesty would've been great. ",2
" Very creative cooking, great service and pleasing ambience. It’s our second meal there and it’s been very consistent. We plan to return. ",5
 Alison was great responsive server. ,5
" This is part of our Philly empire of Mike Solomonov &amp; Steven Cook - their collaboration really enhanced our city and placed us on the international gourmet map. They hired a fabulous chef - Y. Sichel - who really has taken traditional multi-cultured Jewish food to breathtaking highs. The food was so creative, with unexpected flavors within the sauces, each ingredient on the plate carrying a delicious surprise.  Yet none of it was off-putting or over the top.  If you like to share you will have lots of fun. The bar has a wonderful selection of wines/beers/mixed drinks.  From the moment you enter you receive smiles and warm welcomes - all the staff were fabulous.  The bar is small but able to handle happy hours or full service. Really a great treat. ",5
 We experienced Abe Fisher’s Restaurant Week menu and each of our choices was delicious.  My husband ate the liver pate which he loved.  The mackerel dip was so good and we love that it was served with lettuce leaves.  We both also ordered fish larger dishes which were cooked to perfection.  Our waitress was terrific. ,5
 Loved everything we tried from the Restaurant week menu.  We will definitely be back for more! ,5
" I am glad we waited for Restaurant week to try this place out. We ordered 6 dishes, 2 apps each and one larger plate each. My boyfriend wasn’t keen on the menu selections and really only like one of the 6 plates we had. Me, I liked them all including the braised tongue although that did take a bit of mental maneuvering to actually give it a fair shake. Overall definitely worth a try. I hope I can get back there again, it will just have to be with my gal pals cause I don’t think my boyfriend will go back. ",4
 We ordered the Montreal Short Ribs and they were amazing.  We sat at the chefs counter and ,5
 We had the tasting menu which was fantastic. It provided many small plates in addition to the main course which were all incredible. Would highly recommend to anyone. ,5
 Interesting tapa-like plates; more gimmicky than wholesome ,4
" The two of us were visiting Philly during a long weekend, and carefully chose three nice restaurants. Abe Fisher was the best by a wide margin.  The service, from the moment we arrived, was fabulous. Caring and sincere. Stephen took care of us at the table and was very clear and helpful with selling a point of view. He listened closely.  The food was one of the best meals we have had, EVER. We were not alone in this view, as the neighboring table was so enthusiastic about their choices that they fixed a plate of the short rib and handed it to us! We traded food and stories until it was time to go.  We are already planning to return with an armada of friends and family. ",5
" I have nothing but love for Abe Fisher. The service was impeccable - prompt, friendly and knowledgeable...what more can you ask for? My cocktail, the Gran Torino, was special. It was bourbon-based and had a wonderful citrus aroma with perfect flavors.  I had the prix-fixe with three small plates consisting of a brussels sprouts  dish, a sweet potato dish, and the highly reviewed schnitzel tacos. All were absolutely wonderful, but those brussels sprouts  won’t soon be forgotten. The combination of the charred sprouts, golden raisins, pine nuts, and pieces of hard cheese was absolutely delightful. It’s the one dish that I didn’t leave a speck on the plate. The peppers on the sweet potato dish were also a high note of the experience. It was an unexpected bite with the sweet potato, and I loved it. I wish that I would’ve left room for dessert, but the three small plates more than overfilled my stomach. I had to take the second taco to go. I went early on a cold Tuesday night, so there weren’t many other diners in the restaurant, but I can’t imagine that this place doesn’t do a great business with the quality of both the food and service. Highly recommend! ",5
 Amazing meal! Best latkies and chicken liver mouse we have ever had and the duck was to die for! Will totally be back! ,5
" Excellent and interesting food with a slight Eastern European feel. Our group of 6 (5 out town guests in town for a conference) selected the Chef's choice with the Montreal ribs. All courses served on shared plates. Eclectic and delicious. The Montreal Ribs were outstanding; best beef I have tasted in years and years. Service was attentive, friendly and non-intrusive.  Some of my friends told me later they had been skeptical, but were really impressed and pleased. ",5
" I took my girlfriend for her birthday, we have been in the past and enjoyed ourselves. The dessert is her absolute favorite thing. Bacon, and egg chocolate mousse or so. Food tastes great! Nice and quiet, you do not feel rushed at all. The staff works well together to make sure you are taken care of. Sarah our waitress was the best part of the night. She was amazing! Very good at her job and dedinitely knows her stuff.  Will be returning in a gew months. It is very pricey! ",4
" Short rib was amazing as was the chicken liver. Normally, I cannot stand chicken liver, or any liver, but this was terrific. With one exception, the tasting menu was excellent. We could to even finish everything. ",4
" Inattentive waiter, fortunately a trainee eventually came over and was very helpful. VERY long wait for dinner which was a very run of the mill burger. Would not return. ",1
 This was our 1st visit and definitely not our last. We found it via Groupon. The food was cooked to perfection and our service was professional by Wayne. Highly recommended ,5
" We went before a show at the Delaware Symphony Orchestra and even received a 20% discount when we showed our tickets.  Everyone enjoyed their food, especially the Dijon chicken. ",4
 Great staff New ownership Will def go back to the taproom ,5
 While i had a good experience here there needs to be some improvement for this restaurant to obtain a higher rated from me. Every time I patronize this restaurant it takes quite some time to be greeted by a server; same has happened when I have sat at the bar. We had to have been seated about 10-15 minutes before the waitress came over and the restaurant was not crowded at all. The manager even came over to ask if someone had been over because it then took another 10 minutes just to get water. The food was good however I have not had anything here that makes me want to visit more often to get. It is a very nice location and ambience is always lovely but more needs to be done to be more customer pleasing and friendly. ,3
 Good food prepared and served quickly enough for those on lunch hour. ,5
 Great place.  We were in the area for a concert at the Grand Opera House and this was a perfect choice.  Nice food options and very good service.  Nice large bar as well.  Would return! ,5
 Served water that tasted of clorox.  I think that they didn't rinse the pitcher or water dispenser after cleaning it.  Waitress thought that we were complaining about city water taste.  We insisted that the water was tainted.  We were given fresh glasses of water.  It did taste bad but not of bleach.  Only a casual apology.  No manager asking about our health from the experience. ,2
" This was a fun restaurant. The Eagles game was on the TVs and there was a lively crowd around the bar enjoying the game. The service was a bit slow, but there was only one bartender and he was also a server. Food was fine - we had hamburgers. Flatbread appetizer was small but tasty. ",4
 Service was great and food was very good.  We had a reservation for 10 and with bad weather 4 could not make it.  They were very accommodating for whatever our group wanted.  Would definitely recommend for others. ,4
" GREAT PLACE, MUSIC WAS TOO LOUD FOR MY 80 YEAR OLD MOTHER ",3
" Wayne was an excellent server! He was extremely helpful and definitely the reason I plan on visiting in the next week or so. Also, food was delicious! ",5
 Excellent service for dinner before concert at Grand ,4
" IN A FORMER BANK LOBBY WHICH WAS ONCE QUITE ELGANT. GOOD FOOD, FAIR WINE LIST AND VERY VERY NOISY. WE WERE THERE FOR PRE-THEATER AT THE OPERA HOUSE AND IT WORKED WELL FOR THAT. WAIT STAFF WORKED HARD AND TRIED TO PLEASE. FOOD WAS GOOD BUT NOT STELLAR. I THOUGHT THEY WERE A BIT OVERWHELMED WITH CUSTOMERS. OVERALL, A GOOD PLACE TO GET A REASONABLE DINNER AND HAVE A DRINK AT A FAIR PRICE. ",4
" Food &amp; beer were great, though service had some issues.  Menu questions were disregarded instead of being answered (like ingredient questions based on allergy so menu decision could be made &amp; and we were told we couldn't order that night's specials, it seemed like we were a bother).  Also the restrooms needed attention, hoping that improves as that may be a deal breaker ",4
 Had a lovely dinner before a concert at the Grand.  Excellent food and great beer selection.  Will definitely be back!!!! ,5
" Waitress was awesome, food great.  We had excellent time ",5
" We arrived at a busy time between shows (5:30), and had a reservation. Service was slow and chaotic - soup arrived before my boyfriend's bourbon, which he would have preferred to drink in the 20+ minutes before the soup arrived. My wine arrived with my meal. Flounder and crab cakes very good and nicely presented, though way too much cheese in small cup of soup. Chocolate torte very good. Tables and flooring more suited to lunch spot. Wouldn't return or recommend. ",2
 Visited this resturant a few years ago now it is very tired.  Had a noticible smell and was just not in good repair.  I think manageemnt should make a point of sitting at each table and make note of what needs to be done to improve environment.  Food was okay nothing special. ,2
" Food and service were good.  It is definitely too loud, however.  Impossible to carry on a conversation over the performers.  Sound system needs upgrading..even individual speakers are unintelligible.  Do people actually enjoy paying for a meal to have their ears assualted??? ",4
 Nice place for fabulous bar food and drinks.  Excellent beer selection.  Must order several of the tacos which were tremendous. ,4
" The location of this restaurant is ideal for a place to eat near several downtown Wilmington destinations. The food was pretty good (I did love the steak fries) but the rest was just ok. We had a really nice and attentive server (Max) who took very good care of us. The biggest downfall for us was the very loud rap music playing when we entered that almost made us leave. When you walk in you enter the bar which is filled with tv's and is pretty loud. We were looking for a good meal and good conversation while on a night out without kids. This was off-putting. The staff was helpful though and put us up on the balcony which was much quieter. The music did change so that was better. Nonetheless, I would not suggest this as a quiet place to eat. If you are looking for a place to watch the game or sit at the bar then you would love it. The decor is also very strange. It's not cohesive and felt mismatched in a place that has such beautiful architecture. The vibe just does not match the space and it felt like a big miss for us on the ambience scale. The meal was $60.00 and just felt pricey for what we ordered. The food was decent but not noteworthy. The server made up for the shortfalls but I don't think we would return. I'm happy to pay good money for above average food and a great atmosphere. I think this place just needs to figure itself out. Is it a sports bar (that apparently has live music from time to time) or an upscale restaurant? It just doesn't work as is. ",3
" We stopped here for a Sunday night dinner. It is definitely a sports bar--lots of seating and TVs. We shared a crab cake and pulled pork sandwiches--both were good. The bar was not very busy, but there were enough tables occupied to keep the waiter busy. I would imagine it is much busier on a work night. Overall a nice meal. ",3
 I ordered a sandwich with no roll and it came out plated nicely and was delicious.  My husband’s steak was perfect. They do need to continue to work on their timing for the theatre going crowd. ,4
" Been here several times and enjoy the decor, ambiance and food.  Great location, too. ",5
" Excellent fish dinner for my friend and me...different selections. Noise level is on the high side, but it worked well with the the live music from local artists that were playing the night of our dinner. Excellent wait staff. Have eaten here more than just a few times and always enjoy the experience. ",5
" Perhaps the worst meal I have had in years.  Wine was horrible, pours were small and food was greasy.  We had steaks which were overly fatty and over cooked.  I ate lunch there before and it was a decent meal but this dinner was horrendous.  Service was at best mediocre. It took is 15 minutes to get drinks and ages for dinner.    I cannot recommend this place as it currently exists. ",1
" Went in on a Monday night before the football game.  Place was practically empty which was fine with me, add it gave me an opportunity to talk with the staff who were fantastic. (Maisie at the bar was great)  Had a bowl of chorizo chili and pork tacos which came out quickly, were hot and delicious. Decent value as well. I'll be back. ",3
 loved the outdoor table. the food was OK the flatbread was not good but the beef vegetable soup was good as was my husband's burger.  Waitress did not check on us after food was served so after 5 minutes I got up and found salt myself. all in all just an OK meal with great outside scenery. ,3
" Ate there with friends on a Wed night. They had music and two bands that were extremely loud, and far from out tastes, and we couldn't talk. Finally they had one singer who did a great job. Service was moderate to good - friendly staff I feel they do best with burgers &amp; tacos - more of a bar cuisine than dinner food and ambiance. Had wine - even though we chose the more expensive wine (by the glass) one was ""skunked and the other apparently had new &amp; old. Crab soup was the worst ever encountered, anywhere, in the last 15 years. Burgers were very good ( we had a mix of their different offerings and all seemed to like them). I could not recommend this place unless you want a friendly environment for beer and tacos. ",3
 Food was pretty good - service was amazing!  Could not have been better...it was pretty empty when we visited early Sat night. ,5
 Our waiter was FANTASTIC! I believe his name was Ike! Perfect! ,4
 Very friendly and accommodating hostess and waitstaff. ,5
 Isaac was an awesome server and made the experience! ,4
 Just went for the first time last week for a Wilmo Wednesday live music event and  was so impressed. The ambiance is casual and relaxed; the menu diverse; food was outstanding; great happy hour menu; excellent service; and loved the live music. We will be back. ,5
 Great place!!!! Be back soon. ,5
 Awesome beer selection and a darn good Taproom Burger served by a great staff in a beautiful old public house in the heart of the city's nightlife. We went on a night the had live music. ,4
 Great food n people ,5
" Our waiter, Elvis, made great recommendations and provided great service! ",4
" Overall, it was very good. My only issue was that they brought out my dinner but we waited on my wife's. It was a 10 minute space between meals, and by then my dinner was cold, so they took it back to reheat. The server was very apologetic, and she did a good job, but the kitchen let her down. ",4
 This is one of my favorite restaurants.  Im very sad that they wont have the dancers anymore.  Everyone we take to Amada loves it and wants to go back again.  The people that work there and the management is excellent and very accomadating. ,5
 We had an opportunity to be part of the last night of flamenco dancing and although a very short presentation  it was memorable.  The restaurant is a tapast place and the only negative comment is that we felt the waiter was more interested in us ordering more expensive dishes than giving us wonderful suggestions.  We ended up ordering way too much food. ,4
" Amada was worth the wait...I made a reservation more than a month in advance for my special birthday dinner celebration. We had a party of ten and it was the first time dining at the restaurant for many of us. All of the staff from hostess to waiters and assistants were all very pleasant and service focused. The food was unique, beautifully presented and extremely delicious. The only thing that seemed off or perhaps rushed, was the pacing of the delivery of the dishes. It seemed too fast at times. We were barely able to eyeball what had a appeared and decide what to taste and then suddenly there was MORE and MORE ... not a bad thing from a quantity perspective, but give your diners a chance to take in each offering. Overall, excellent! ",4
" The food was excellent and our server, Daniel, was superb.  Thanks. ",5
" Excellent restuarant, still without a doubt one of my favorite 2 restaurants in Philadelphia.  In this past visit, my seventh, I tried some dishes I had not previously sampled and loved each of them, in particular the lamb special. ",5
" Pricey, but well worth it. ",4
 What a great place!  We go whenever we have the chance.  The tapas is inventive and always delicious.  Fun to eat at the bar too!  Great sangria and wonderful wine choices.  Don't miss dessert!!  the Crema Catalana is to die for!! ,5
" Great experience - we eat there frequently and always enjoy it.  The service started out a little slow, for some reason we always find ourselves waiting several minutes for drinks and to order.  Once the order is in, though, the service is usually very good.  All in all, a favorite restaurant. ",4
 A great authentic Spanish tapas restaurant.  Lots of traditional tapas and some creative ones. ,4
 We enjoyed Amada tremendously.  We previously loved Tinto and wanted to try this restaurant as well. ,4
 Fantastic food with great service and a nice atmosphere. ,5
 Our favorite restuarant in Philadelphia  Glad to have found Kevin (the wine guy) again ,5
 The food here is amazing. Amazing. Amazing. I never knew steak could melt in my mouth. Every little delicious bite was like heaven. This restaurant is vying energetically for the to spot on my list of favorite Philly restaurants. ,5
 Simply the best in Philly !!!! ,5
" While the bill can get out of control in a hurry, the food and the house drinks were phenomenal. Much more of a special occasion than a frequent dinner sort of place. ",4
" Chef Garces is amazingly talented.  My husband and I went to Amada a few months ago and ordered from the Chef's menu (highly recommend).  All but one dish (the octopus, which was dry) was INCREDIBLE!  We especially loved the oysters, duck confit pizza and the ensalada dejambon salad.  The charcuterie selection was tasty, esp. with the pitcher of sangria we ordered!  The lavender custard was beyond delicious and not overpowering at all.  The only complaint I have is the small dining room.  I can't wait to go back!!! ",4
 excellent food and atmosphere ,3
 Outstanding tapas..all of them! Next time we'll be back to try the paella! ,5
" While the bill can get out of control in a hurry, the food and the house drinks were phenomenal.  Much more of a special occasion than a frequent dinner sort of place. ",4
 Always a great experience at Amada.  From the attentive service to the wonderful food.  Usually go with Chef's recommendations and have never been disappointed. ,4
" I've been here a few times, and each visit has been an incredible experience! See my full write-up at: http://www.yelp.com/biz/amada-philadelphia#hrid:LKO_LLfhvSpduJo0jN3yIw/src:self ",5
 Expensive given quality. Good if you're looking for good ambience. ,3
 Absolutely our favorite restaurant in Philly ,5
 favortie restaurant in the city!! food is phenominal!! ,4
" I had never gone to a tapas restaurant before, and we ordered way too much food, but each and every dish was perfectly flavored and delicious. Very impressive! Loved the menu options--dined at Amada's brother restaurant later and did not enjoy the menu nearly as much--particularly the cheeses with the balsamic strawberry dressing. I have since sent friends, family, and business associates to dine there, and everyone has reported back that they loved it too! ",5
" The food is excellent; love that it's Spanish and not some Latin-fusion cuisine.  Very pricey for the quantity, however.  Definitely on my short-list for special occasion meals. ",4
 First time dining there. Good. Fun. ,4
 Outstanding food for a very very reasonalbe price.  BYOB too!! ,5
" One of the best meals in Philly.  The tasting menu was excellent.  Trust the chef to make the selections for you,a nd you won't be disappointed.  We were also surprised at the quantity.  Without a set menu, we did not know when the food would stop coming.  I finally had to turn away some food because it was simply too much!  But every bite I had was wonderful. ",4
 The tasting menu was fantastic! Please replace pebbles with a real floor and the benches with real chairs. Sitting at the front two tables is uncomfortable. ,4
 Love Nectar! It’s our go to place for special occasions and never disappoints! Thank you Nectar for another wonderful anniversary dinner. ,5
" Our experience was great until I realized our server had put my food order in wrong. I ordered from the seasonal specials and read the name of the order and pointed to it as well. Instead of a nice meal, I was brought a sushi roll (after already eating sushi as an appetizer) and thought maybe I misunderstood what I had ordered since it was listed as seasonal and not with the other rolls on the menu. When our server finally came back about 45 minutes after we had received our food, I asked about what I had ordered and she then realized she had given me the wrong item and remembered me pointing to what I wanted. At that point, we had been there a couple hours and were ready to leave. We were offered a complimentary dessert, but needless to say, I left feeling very unsatisfied. ",3
 We go there as a couple or as a family for special occasions. We have never been disappointed . The food is great.  And value is excellent. ,5
" Incredible atmosphere at Nectar and phenomenal, creative food. This combination allows for a great dining experience. ",5
 Nectar always delivers!  Great food and service...highly recommend for any occasion. ,4
 Nectar used to be my go to special occasion restaurant.  The past few times was disappointing.   Is it going downhill?  The food came out so fast I think they must have it precooked.  Our pork Dumplings were cool yet they fell apart as if they were overcooked.  The edamame was delicious.  Our groups 5 entree choices  came out minutes after ordering and were lukewarm.  The sashimi was very good.  Good service from our server but they tried too often to clear our plates.    Overall disappointing. ,3
" Our server was fantastic, but the additional servers who supported our party of 4 were as stellar.  We received a 5-star treatment. It was my daughter's 14th birthday dinner and her surprise dessert was adorable.  A perfect evening! ",5
" Started with calamari and edamame - both were delicious. Then had the king kong roll and a seared tuna roll. The seared tuna roll was perfect; I loved every bite. The king kong roll (lobster and filet) was not my favorite. The pieces of tuna were cut so thick that it was difficult to chew. Would have preferred the pieces to be thinner, which would also make the filet seem more tender as that was also difficult to chew - not sure it was actually filet. Overall was a great experience and staff was on top of their game giving us everything we need without being noticed; which I love! Will be back. ",5
" Food was phenomenal, background music was fun to listen to, and the service was even better! ",5
 Had not been to Nectar in over a year and we were not disappointed. We had forgotten how great it is to have an Asian Fusion high end restaurant in the suburbs  and not have to trek to the city. Looking forward to coming back soon. ,5
 Waited 20min before a server took drink orders. Another 15min to get drinks. Was not  asked for another round of drinks. Over 20min to have plates removed. Was not asked about desserts. Overall terrible experience. Would never recommend or go back ,2
 Everything was basically on point the reason i wouldn’t give it the highest rating is because it a bit tight.  It’s to crowded and the way it’s set up is too in personal ,4
" Met friends we hadn't seen for years.  We all loved our dinners.  The edamame dumplings were delicious as was the wild mushroom pad Thai.  Great for vegetarians.  On our reservation we requested a quiet table and they gave us a perfect spot curtained off, private and quiet.  A great dining experience! ",5
 Sushi was not good. But pad Thai was alright. Very cool atmosphere but seems like an opportunity missed for a great experience. ,3
 Consistently good food and great service ,5
" I didn't know the location was valet only, so I went into a mini-panic because I never carry cash. The valet people were super friendly and funny. Luckily I was able to get couple of dollars for the valet. Kevin our waiter was attentive enough, he came around just enough for us to feel taken care of but not bothered. I had the mango roll, it was good, not the best sushi I've ever had but a lot better then other locations. The drinks were delicious and the desert, mint brownie ice-cream, was okay. Nothing special.   I would describe the atmosphere as cozy and warm. I'd go again to give other items on the menu a try. ",4
 This restaurant never disappoints. We have been a few times now and we are always thrilled with every coarse. ,5
 Always enjoy the food and ambiance but last visit took about 30 minutes to place food and drink order. ,5
 The seasonal roasted pumpkin and avocado roll was absolutely delightful and I hope that they will add it to their full time menu soon; a lovely experience. ,5
 Steak was undercooked ,4
" Love this restaurant we hadn't eaten at Nectar in 3-4 years and made a reservation last minute and met another couple Saturday night . Amazing service from check in at the front desk to the hostess to our incredible waitress . The good was delicious we had 3-4 starters , calamari , tuna tartare , and some others , great wine selection and ambiance . Dinner was delicious we ordered 3-4 dishes and shared . Portions are generous and we ended dinner with a cappuccino and doughnuts for dessert . We will be back ! ",5
 Just skip everything and go straight to the homemade mini cinnamon donuts with dipping sauces for dessert. ,5
" Solid experience, service was a little rushed at first with 4 dishes coming out at once, would have preferred to enjoy the 2 orders of foie gras and then the two orders of pork buns  separately. Foie gras should be enjoyed slowly and then the next course should then follow once we finished. This way the foie doesn’t get cold before you can enjoy It to the fullest. Drinks were excellent, while my Roasted stripe bass was not very good. I was given a free drink as a consolation. I also wound up ordering another order of the foie gras since I was still a tad hungry. Also ordered multiple sushi courses which all were very good. Finished with the donuts. Overall a good experience for New Year’s Eve. With tip the dinner wound up being a 280 dollar meal for two. Only gripe I could say is, that if a customer only takes one bite out of their entree, a free 12 dollar drink isn’t proper consolation over a 28 dollar dish, which was still on the bill. I didn’t want to make a fuss because I enjoyed the experience and wanted to ring in 2018 in a positive way.  Overall I had a good time and will be back, as this is my favorite place to celebrate special occasions. ",4
 New Year’s Eve ,5
" Outstanding food, wonderful service. It was New Year's Eve, so the place was PACKED, and the noise level was high.  But still had a very nice dinner.  Wine list is pricey. ",5
" We were there for dinner on New Year’s Eve. It was crowded and somewhat noisy, but we had a wonderful meal and extraordinary service. Of course, we always have delicious food and excellent service when we dine at Nectar. ",5
 We went to Nectar for New Year's Eve and it was great! We were seated promptly and the service and food were fantastic. Can't wait to go back again! ,5
" Been more than a year since my wife and I last visited Nectar - we will be back a deal sooner next time round.  Quite and exceptional range of food types - more than one expects even in ""Asian fusion"".  We were there early evening on New Year's Eve - the place was very busy.  The wait staff was wonderfully well organized - smooth and very efficient.  The food was very good indeed and we took the opportunity to get away from traditional winter/Holiday food.  Cold dishes and hot were equally good and equally well served. ",4
 Nectar is consistently excellent Portions small but good ,5
" I am a New Yorker and visit Nectar when I am staying in the area. This place is magnificent to say the least! The chef is gifted, the menu and offerings are delicious. All in a vibrant and beautiful space that is pleasing to the eye. It has BIG CITY flare in a small town.  You simply must visit, enjoy, and brag about it. ",5
" Sushi appetizer, amazing; pad Thai, amazing and the mini donut dessert, highly recommend.  This is why Nectar is my favorite Main Line restaurant .... it never disappoints. ",5
" Always an excellent meal, superb service and great cocktails ",5
 Very good Service. Wait staff Friendly. Food very good ,4
 My favorite restaurant. ,5
" Good service, beautiful presentation, excellent food. What's not to like? ",5
 Christmas party (small company!). Delicious! ,5
" First, his holiness the Dalai Lama never said ""Approach love and cooking with reckless abandon."" (Check Snopes) They should remove this from their advertising as it is actually a pretty non-Buddhist thing to say in addition to being false.  On to the food -- it is very good, but not brilliant.  Still, very nice to have in the neighborhood and we go a few times a year, though I think it is overpriced. ",4
" Upscale feel from food, service, ambiance, valet, etc., without being overpriced.  Had a great experience across the board and will be back again for sure. ",4
 I would have given 5 stars but...one glass of scotch $28??? All 4 of us agreed the  food was fabulous. Service was excellent. The cost of the liquor was out of sight in our opinion. Glass of Savignon Blanc was reasonable at $10 so I’d suggest sticking with wine when you go. ,3
 My fiancé and I love Nectar. It never disappoints! Great food and fantastic service. We had Bob as our waiter recently and he went above and beyond to make our dining experience great! Highly recommend dining at Nectar for a date night or night out with friends. ,5
" I have been to Nectar for dinner twice now and the food, service and beautiful setting is consistent.  My family gave a party for 25 people here recently and it went like clockwork.  Everyone was helpful and the party was a great success.  I've even recommended it to an acquaintance who was considering where to give a birthday party.  Keep up the good work. ",5
" Food and service was superb.  Presentation was just as nice, and the ambiance is great. ",5
 Excellent attentive service. Food was delicious and beautifully presented. Good quality ingredient used in the meals served. Extensive menu. Would go back to this restaurant in a heartbeat. ,5
" We really appreciated the staff remembering our anniversary.   The waitress said ""Happy Anniversary"" when we arrived.  She also brought us a complimentary dessert with an Anniversary chocolate on top.  Very nice touch. ",4
" It seems like a very trendy spot. Decor was amazing with high ceilings, asian art themes and 2 floor cellar. Food was mediocre. Ordered the Maki Lunch and rolls were wrapped very sloppy. Jumbo lump crab roll was dry. It's a great looking place but it's no Buddakan. Price is what you would expect to spend in a trendy, Steven Starr-ish restaurant. ",3
 We went for our anniversary and it was perfect!  The meal was delicious from start to finish - especially the dessert!  My husband's macadamia nut cookie and key lime ice cream sandwich was to die for!  We might go back just for that! ,5
" Loved the food, lots of business people sitting too close to us though. ",3
" Great place. We had our doubts with the menu (it appeared a bit too mixed with some Japanese, some Chinese, some Thai, etc.), but everything we ordered was very well prepared. Great ambiance. Prices were reasonable. A definite recommendation. ",4
 menu is too old (5+ years without a change)...needs to be changed - no point in going back ,2
" overpriced, service was inattentive and cursory, food was excellent but the bass was too salty ",3
" Beautiful decor, wonderful food ",5
 We have dined at Nectar several times and this was the first time we've ever had such poor service.  Luckily the food is delicious and the ambiance is beautiful.  Our waiter was less than attentive.  He did not refill our drinks or askhow our food was.  Though I'm sure this was a rare incident- Nectar is a spectacular restaurant that we truly do enjoy and will continue going back to. ,4
" I went there almost a year ago and I continue to think about it...and how much I absolutely LOVED everything about it. I have told many, many people about the awesomeness of Nectar, and I cannot wait to return! ",5
" It was very nice, but over priced. They need to update there sushi menu. There is not enough choices. ",3
" It was so loud we will not be returning for dinner, although the food was great.  We will go for lunch - also the wine list was quite overpriced. ",3
 Very nice but loud. Give up on the valet parking; it's unnecessary and waiting for the car at the end of dinner (in line) was a negative. ,4
" The only negative is having to sit at the middle tables and have loud people at the table right next to you and literally shoulder to shoulder.    The food, decor and service are outstanding. ",5
" Great experience all around.  Nice crowd, good service, delicious food. A little pricey but it's a night out. ",4
 Seems to be very popular! My friend loves the food there. I am not the best judge since I am vegetarian but I can tell the concept works and runs well. Nice atmosphere ,4
" The service is always spectacular at Nectar, and so is the food.  The Express Lunch option is great because you get soup or a salad and a generously portioned entree for a great price.  Can't wait to go back! ",5
 Music had an over riding base thumping to it. very annoying after about 10 minutes. ,4
" The menu was deceptively extensive and varied.  Even the pickiest among us had difficulty choosing, but all four of us thoroughly enjoyed our meals. The appetizers and entrees were uniformly excellent and the presentations were nice. The atmosphere was simple, but fine.  Not noisy, though the bar looked to be active.  We had an easy time conversing without having to raise our voices.  The chairs were comfortable and the tableware was clean.  The service was fine.  Nothing super special but nothing to complain about in an up-scale casual restaurant.  ""Free"" valet parking was quite convenient and unassuming.  Not at all pretentious.  I would not hesitate to return and I am looking forward to my return. ",4
" Wine list is notable...for being narrowly conceived, unimaginative and grossly overpriced. ",4
 Very good restaurant ,5
" The food was great, but the place ran out of 2 of the entrees, one of which was a special fairly early (we had an 8:00 reservation). ",4
 Thank you for a great meal and a great night out. We will be back again!!!! ,5
" Very good food and presentations were good, not great. Service was acceptable but not stellar. It was moderatley expensive but worth it for a special occasion. It appears to be a happening spot. ",4
 we really enjoyed our meal and will definitely return in the future.  the food was excellent--even my 12-year old son really enjoyed his entire meal. ,4
" Some dishes were outstanding while others were average, but good. The hot mini donut desert was very good. It was a little loud inside and some of the tables are rather close together. Overall it was a good experience, but I don't think it was quite worth the price ($100 for two people, no alcohol, before tip). ",4
 We went to Nectar for lunch and had great experience.  My friend was a half hour late and they did not ask about our order until she arrived.  We all enjoyed our express lunch which at $9.95 may have been a better value than McDonalds. ,4
 Very accomodating. Sat outside-perfect night. Presentation wonderful. ,4
" Lunch on the outdoor patio was enjoyable.  Very good food, good service.  I find Nectar overpriced for dinner, but lunch is a great value with the same foods in different portions. ",4
" Overpriced, slow service, and small portions, if your into that sort of thing. ",2
 I live in Center City Philadelphia and Nectar is one of my favorite restaurants.  The only negative at this time is not Nectars doing - but adding the cost oif two gallons of gas to the bill.. ,4
 The food is delicious...a great place to have a birthday or other special treat. Prices are moderatly expensive. ,4
 The Australian waitress was a little inexperienced but wonderful nevertheless. ,5
" A very good dining experience. I especially enjoyed all the lobster offerings on the menu. I don't typically see this at other restaurants. so nice that it is in the area, not a far drive for me at all.. ",5
 I already sent you a review but here it is again. I am a very frequent Nectar customer and if this had been my first visit it would have been my last. Waitress was very poor. I arrived before my guest and summoned the waitress telling her that i was a diabetic and was feeling weak and needed food quickly. I ordered the lobster miso soup and some bread. 15-20 mins later i was quite shaky and no food was brought. I found the mgr and he got me the food within 2 minutes. You had to be a detective to find the lobster in the lobster miso soup. The crab rolls were okay but too small. The choc sorbet for dessert was very good. The waitress never apologized and never came back to check on us. Will not return there for months. Going to Merdiths! ,2
" Wine list was very very small.  Not many good choices, either. ",4
" very good food, service excellent, a go back to restaurant.  enjoyable ",4
" I left Nectar wondering when I was going to come back again. I fell in love with this restaurant from the moment I walked in. Our waiter was extremely friendly, outgoing, and willing to answer all of our questions about the decor. Everything was immaculate and captivating. The menu was wonderful and different, a break from all the other same food that gets served at other restaurants. Thank you for the wonderful experience. ",5
" Not that many seats at the bar.  People who stand are in the way of foot traffic.  One bartender totally ignored us as we stood for about 5 minutes.  When another couple came up to the bar, she waited on them still ignoring us.  It was another bartender who waited on us.  Other than that, it was a very nice evening. ",4
 The service was impeccable and the food was amazing!  I highly recommend the cinnamon sugar doughnuts for dessert and the spict tuna roll and a great side for your entree or appetizer. ,5
" Some dishes were outstanding, like the tea-smoked venison, and others were very good but similar to what could be found at other gourmet restaureants.  Not an exciting dessert list.  Definitely a place you have to visit multiple times to try all of the interesting dishes. ",4
 Good Food.  Signature desert disappointing. Very very loud. ,3
 Everything was great -- will definitely go back!!! ,5
" The food and service were excellent, but compared to similar class restaurants in the area, the prices are outrageous! 6 bucks for 1 piece of eel sushi....LOL  If you want outstanding sushi for a better price, go to Bluefin on Germantown pike.     The fusion dishes were great and interesting.  Presentation was great..but again...dinner for 2 and 3 drinks shouldn't have been 220 bucks. ",4
 loved it. ,5
" Very disappointing experience. Food was pretty good, but service was absolutely awful, which among other things caused my entree to come late and cold.  Didn't even offer to comp an appetizer or anything- very chinsy. ",2
 Our favorite place in the burbs! ,5
 very loud place ,3
 This was our second trip to Nectar and it continues to be one of the best restaurants on the Main Line. ,4
 Fun terrific food great with friends ,2
" Other than the high noise volume, which can be easily diminished by an iterior decorator, with some design sense and who knows something about acustics, natural barriers in spaces, the food and service was delightful. I would more than likely not take another 1st date there. It's difficult to get related to people, when you're yelling at them!!! Thank you, FS ",5
 They didn't give us our dining points.  We did not get credit for the reservation. ,3
 Good but expensive. ,4
 it was super loud...The food was great but very $$$$$ and very small. ,2
" I have eaten here many times and think it is GREAT, but pricely. I thought that $12.00 for a glass of wine was much. The staff is very pleasant. I will return. ",4
 Opportunity for improve Ambiance by addressing noise factor.  Consider area barriers that are absorb sound while intregrating into the atmosphere.  Otherwise Great! ,5
 Fantastic!  One of our favorites. ,5
" Food, drink and service were outstanding.  Very unique choice of background music.  Side-by-side tables were a little too close to one another, but we struck up a pleasant conversation with other dining customers. ",5
" Service was outstanding.  Generous portions of delectible food for dinner, great selection of appetizers, all topped off by creative dessert presentations that were the perfect ending to a wonderful meal.  Will definitely return for special occasions with my husband, who is usually just a basic meat and potatoes man and fussy about where we dine out.  He loved the whole experience. ",4
 We love Nectar however this was our first time dining on deck outside.  The view was terrible and I wouldn't sit out there again. Table 409 is our favorite. ,3
 A great experience! ,5
" Wonderful design inside, excellent food, great wine seletion, attentive service. Excellent mix of Chinese, Thai and Japanese food. True Asian Fusion. I think one of the things that make this restaurant stand out is last Thursday one of the owners was active on the floor and trully helping. Standout restuarant with a wonderful ambiance. ",4
" Everything was great, except the noise level, which prevented us from conversing with our friends. And this was on a week night. We won't go back. ",3
" It was our anniversary and they sent out a free dessert.  The food was top-notch.  We will be going back, hopefully a lot! ",5
" When you are only 2 people, make sure to ask for a table apart from other tables, otherwise you may be placed in long line of tables, close together, that make you feel like you are at a banquet with a bunch of people you don't know.   They should put more space in between the tables along the walls. ",4
 Nectar is reliable but it would be nice for them to change the menu at least once a year.  Running out of appetizer and dinner choices.  The service was very good on Saturday Night; not always the case. ,4
" The food was fabulous.  The room is gorgeous but we were seated in the bar area, which would not be my choice again.  Our service staff were supberb.  Highlights:  poached lobster and scallops and striped bass.  The only slightly down note was the calamari and edamame 'salad' - slightly soggy calamari in one bowl and delicious edamame in another with crisped salty hot peppers.  Fairly expensive. ",4
 Portions are a little too small. Only complaint ,4
" Always great food and a great time.  Wait staff is very attentive.  Bar is well stocked, and wine list is good.  Fun to hang out at the bar if table is not yet available.  Always non-smoking! ",5
 The quality of the fare did not live up to the advance billing. ,3
 Nectar has the freshest sushi around! ,4
 Expensive but excellent food.  high-priced wines and cocktails.  somewhat ambivalent server. ,4
 always great food...had excellent service...really love nectar and always recommend it ,4
" I had the Striped Bass, it was ok at best, overcooked on the outside.  Does not compare to the Striped Bass I had at the Striped Bass restaurant in CC Philly and at other restaurants.  My wife and I agreed that the food was also overly salty, including the veggies served with the meals.  My wife had short ribs which she said were good; however, her petit filet was overdone.  We were seated in a section where the tables are too close. We could hear the entire conversation of the table next to us, and they were speaking in normal voices. ",2
 Very enjoyable dinner with nice presentation. ,4
" Everything was fine.  My one complaint is, in particular, my girlfriend's meal (which I believe was some kind of lobster...it was $34 that's all I remember) was kind of small for the price.  So I think the portions were somewhat small considering the expense.  Otherwise, the food was good, the service was great, and the food was served in a timely fashion.  Overall I give the place a 4.5/5. ",4
 the only complaint-the restaurant was hot. ,4
" It was pleasant outdoor dining - wouldn't say ""great"" - everything was very nice, service very good, food very good. ",3
 It was our third visit to Nectar's and each time the food was excellent.  The wine list is rather overpriced.  We had a bottle of pinot noir at $55 which we enjoyed so much that I went to wine store to buy for home and was suprised to find that it was a $10 bottle!  That's a bit of a mark up! ,5
" Really, really loud unless you sit outside, fried rice with pork is outstanding. Very hot bar scene. ",4
 This was my first visit to Nectar after a recommendation from a friend. We brought another couple with us and we very much enjoyed our dining experience. I would love to have the recipe for the Very Berry Martini! Thank you Nectar for a GREAT night out. ,5
" great food - the lamb kabobs are always fantastic - as was the sushi bento box, and crispy chicken.  the music is too loud and they really need to turn it down but it didn't overly interfere with the ambience  the wines by the glass are terrible. all rate 85 and below by wine spectator and still priced at $10 or 11 a glass. you are better off with a martini. for me this is the major reason I don't go to Nectar more - I like to have a good wine with dinner (by the glass) even if everyone else is drinking sweet martinis. ",4
 Very good food other than over cooked filet mignon that was supposed to be medium well. ,4
" I thought this dinin experience was outstanding. I went with my friend, since we were craving Asian food and we fell in love with it. We ordered a meal to share which had spring rolls, mushroom dumplings, chicken dumplings, and pork dumplings. The spring rolls and pork dumplings were my favorite out of the meal. I also extremly enjoyed the mushroom dumpling which I was hesitant to eat since I don't like mushrooms. I was extreamly glad that I tried it and i will defidently recomend it to my other friends, and come back another time. ",5
" Nectar never dissapoints! Once again the sushi was excellent, as well as the entrees. ",4
 The food and service are excellent!  We really enjoyed our experience. Feedback:  Didn't like valet car service (pointless and pretentious)            Needs darkening shade/curtains until nighttime (kind of bright) ,5
" The dining experience was good with one regret.  My husband and I were treating guests to dinner and one of our guests found a bug in his water glass.  It took a while to get a replacement and aside from that, I really feel that the wait staff should have been apologetic during the exchange which they were not. ",4
" Great Food.  I just did not like the fact that every 2 minutes the servers will come and ask us ""Are you done with your food?""  This was right from the begining. They were in such a rush to take our plates and move us out of there. At some point they just remove my friend's plate with out asking, while she was still eating!  When someone goes to a place like this to have a nice diner does not what to be rushed or made to feel that you need to hurry. ",2
" My only complaint would be that the noise level was a little bit higher than I'd like. It was sometimes difficult to hear my dining companion's voice, as well as the server. ",4
" The atmosphere was as pleasant as ever and the service very good. The food, although high quality, was nothing creative or unique. Shrimp, scallop and tenderloin dish was in thick, faux asian sauce that overpowered the protein! Filet and blue cheese potato entree nothing special. Short rib was good but sauce was nothing great. In sum sauces were a disappointment in general. My cocktail was made with Rose's lime rather than fresh lime juice-made it less than refreshing. ",3
" Outstanding food, service and atmosphere. You would never guess you were in Berwyn! ",5
" The food was exceptional and we felt like we were at the judges table on Top Chef.  We started with two dishes: the skewered lamb was delicious and the tuna sashimi with serrano chili was nicely seasoned and perfectly presented.  The striped bass entree with mushrooms, asparagus, and black truffle was so earthy and unique.  We really loved the presence of truffle and enjoyed this perfect balance of flavors and textures.  This fish was prepared perfectly and the presentation was simple, yet classy.  We wanted to lick our plates clean.    The restaurant was loud and the service was very rushed and impersonal with multiple servers and a feeling of disconnect.  However, the food made up for these shortcomings and we would definitely return. ",4
 Excellent food. ,5
 We have dined at Nectar many times and each time was consistently good!!!!!  High city style in the suburbs!!! ,4
" The ""Dim Sum Bento Box for 2"" makes the perfect entree--a sampling of the best food on the menu! ",5
 A good place for a late night dinner for 2 or a group of adults in the burbs. ,4
" The waitstaff was very friendly and the food was good.  Nothing knocked my socks off, but it was an overall nice experience.   A little too loud to make it a great date place, but enough atmosphere where it would work well with group dinners, maybe lunch time dining.  I'd definately come back when in the area. ",3
" sort of disappointed after all of the hype.  Blatant rip-off of Buddakan, but admirable for an area with few great dining options.  Good service. ",3
" Excellent restaurant, fantastic food, great decor ",5
" This was our first time to Nectar- I thought the best part was the service (quick, couteous and respectful)and ambiance. The food was good, but not anything memorable, overall a disappointment. It was really noisy and really expensive for the quality of the food.  Would not go back. Plus you HAVE to use valet to park, that was also a pain. Nectar is rated in Zagats as a 26, we thought it was closer to a 22-23. ",2
" The start menu special for 2 was very small and too expensive.$34??? My dinner was bigger, better and less expensive. ",4
 Excellent as always! ,5
" We thoroughly enjoyed our Nectar experience! Loved the food, the decor (especially the touches like the lit candels up high on the wall) and had wonderful service. We'll be back again!..p.s. probably would have not even called for the reservation just assuming we would be on hold or it would be booked...thank goodness for your online reservations! ",5
 This restaurant is one of the best. I give this 5 stars. The ambiance was very romantic and quite chic. This was one of my best birthdays. I will be going back on the 31st of May.   Nicole ,5
 It is a little overpriced and rushed. For the kind of money you spend there they should allow you to take your time but for 4 people we were served everything within an hour on a Saturday night.  I have had this happen every time I have dined there. ,3
" They seemed to be having computer problems on the night we dined. Our waiter was told by the kitchen that we had already been served, however our plates had not arrived at the table. Everything following that seemed to be delayed as well. The entire meal took almost 2.5 hours since everything was so delayed. However, it was our anniversary and we weren't in a hurry. Also, our babysitter later called us at the restaurant to tell us that the restaurant had called to say we had left our umbrella. While a restaurant calling about an umbrella is above and beyond what is expected, it was funny because we were still at the restaurant and had not even brought an ubrella with us that evening. ",4
 The food and atmosphere are absolutely amazing. ,5
" Great food, very fresh. Seafood was tremendous. Apple Mojitos a delicious, special treat! ",4
 I will say a BIG negative was that there was a private party with a loud speaker in a curtained off room next to our table- all you could hear was that booming voice on the microphone and them clapping. I really do not feel that is the proper place for using the microphone. They should have had a room with a closed door in an area that you would not hear the person on the microphone. It was not the normal nice dining experience- you could not hear the music either because of it. Our waiter BOB wss wonderful as always. ,5
" The prices are way to high for the amount of food you get ... granted, your paying for quality. But paying 35 bucks for two scallops and a lobster claw is ridiculous. I still liked the place a lot though. ",4
 leeks were very salty; everthing else very good; mushroom dumplings excellent! ,4
" Dinner was good, but very overpriced.  Dessert was forgetable, especially the dimed sized portion.  Martinis were delicious. ",4
" Since opening, Nectar has consistently been a pleasant experience for both personal and professional dining. ",4
" We have never been disappointed at Nectar's. The food and service are exceptional. We have celebrated special occasions such as birthdays, anniversaries, Mother's Day and hosted business dinners , as well as, family dinners. This visit we shared with a business associate from the Netherlands and Nectar's is his favorite restaurant in the area.   The special menu varies with foods that are in season.  On this visit it was lobster. One of my favorites was last summer with heirloom tomatoes prepared in various ways. ",5
" An absolutely wonderful night out!  We will be going back, bringing our friends this time. ",4
" Good food. Sushi first course was average, but main course sea bass was excellent. A bit on the pricey side. Noise was quite high. Almost walked out on arrival. Obviously successful,.. but I guess that the noise level is what sells!!!!!!!!!! ",4
" This is the best meal out that my husband and I have had in quite a while.  The food was so good, we didn't want to stop eating it.  We loved it so much that we are going back again this weekend.  The only thing that made us hesitant was the close seating, when there appeared to be plenty, but everyone was seated on top of each other. ",5
" Just one word...superb! Chef Cindy Wolf should have a Michelin Star, for sure. ",5
" This is our favorite restaurant.  It is elegant, quiet enough for conversation, the service is top notch and the food is delicious.  I can’t wait to go back again, ",5
" We celebrated an early Valentine's Day at Charleston, and it was lovely. The three course choice, with cheese and dessert, was perfect and we left quite satisfied. Definitely leave yourself enough time to have a leisurely dinner (though when we mentioned theater tickets they got us out of there right away). The food was beautifully prepared and perfectly proportioned. I'd highly recommend it for a date night or special occasion. ",4
" Another fantastic Meal Chef Wolf, your food never disappoints! ",5
" Excellent food, exceptional service and beautiful ambiance. Knowledgeable attractive staff! ",5
" What an amazing dining experience!  The food is so beautiful and delicious,  the room is beautiful and the staff are friendly and helpful. ",5
" An amazing dining experience.  Top Notch  from the cuisine, wine and great service.  The absolute best dining in Baltimore. ",5
" Creative menu and a wonderful meal. Service was excellent. A bit of a drive from DC to Baltimore, but definitely will go back again for other special occasions! ",5
 This restaurant is very special. The staff goes out of its way to celebrate you. The food is presented beautifully and is delicious. There were nice extra touches to our meals. It is an awesome special treat. ,5
" This was an exquisite meal; thank you! This was my first time at the restaurant, and I loved the delicious tasting options, quiet atmosphere, and languorous pace for our dinner. ",5
 By far one of the best restaurants we have ever visited and we have visited a few. We were there for our thirty ninth anniversary and based on our experience we plan on spending our fourth year anniversary there too. Everyone at the restaurant works fluently for one goal and that is to make sure you have a memorable experience. The dinner selections were a masterpiece. My wife and I selected different courses just to experience more veriety and we were blown away. To make the experience  more vibrant the wine pairing is a must. ,5
" The food was very good and equally expensive.   All items on the menu are tapas/appetizer size.  My wife and I each had three courses with wine- $135 each.  I believe the price without wine would have been $79 each, so we essentially paid an additional $112 for 6 servings of wine.  I call them servings because they do not rise to the level/amount to be called glasses.   We each had dessert and a glass of Taylor Fladgate 10 yr old port for $14 each ($30/bottle retail).   I would recommend Charleston for a special occasion.  Our bill was slightly over $400 with tip. Charleston falls into the - ""just because I can afford it doesn't mean I should buy it"" category. ",4
" We had a lovely dinner recently.  The food was fabulous, our servers terrific, setting perfect. Our head server Andrew made our dinner so enjoyable. Would definitely come back soon. ",5
 The best food and dining experience I've had in Baltimore. Our party was there to celebrate a birthday. The wait staff was attentive but not overbearing. The food was delicious from top to bottom. Definitely will go there again. ,5
" From the moment I walked into the door until valet brought my car to leave, I had the absolute best experience! The staff was awesome, the food was even better. Everyone was attentive without being it being overbearing / annoying. I cannot wait until I am able to go back again. ",5
" As usual, Charleston provides a truly special dining experience. The food is so detailed and appropriately complex. I highly recommend the wine pairings, as this provides the most complete and well rounded culinary experience. The staff is especially attentive making each patron feel so pampered and relaxed. I especially like how  the entire staff is well versed on the food being served so that you are continually reminded of Chef Wolf’s vision and passion for the food being served. ",5
 Birthday Celebration ,5
 Excellent food! Excellent service. Worth spending $$$$! ,5
" The decor is nice and elegant. Not stuffy. We were expecting a bit more creativity in the dishes but the choice is varied and tasty. Portions are small especially for main course but the principal is to try a variety of dishes so overall it works. The service was good even though I would recommend one waiter per table for the entire meal instead of three different waiters who are not equal in their approach. The Maitre D was attentive and knowledgeable. Fried oysters (5) were a bit classic (good not exceptional), lobster soup very good, ceviche very good but small, the sweetbreads as a main, small in portion and could do without the empanada. The seared foie gras was very good but on toast with an egg is unnecessary and uninteresting. Desert chocolate mousse very good, the accompanying small pastries a nice final touch (macaroons were tough though, so few places know how to keep them light).  Wine list is pricey but the variety of wines by the glass allow for a nice solution. The service tended to lull as the evening ended. Would definitely go back to try other dishes and for the calm elegant experience. ",3
" OMG.... everything was perfect. From the moment we walked into Charleston I knew we would have an exceptional meal. Charleston is definitely a wonderful dining experience. It is one of my favorite restaurants, especially for a special occasion. The service, food and ambiance cannot be beat. ",5
" My second visit. Celebrating my sister’s 80th birthday with a girlfriends trip to DC I thought nothing would be more special than to go to Baltimore to dine at Charleston.  It was unbelievable.  Service,  ambience, wine, menu, presentation and food, all exceptional.   My only regret is that I live on the West Coast and unable to dine with regularity at Charleston. Bravo and many thanks for a very special night. ",5
" This was an expensive, but incredible meal.  The wine service was way above average. ",5
" My favorite restaurant in Baltimore!  Saved for special occasions, I wanted to introduce it to my son who has become a fellow foodie.  It was a lovely dining experience.  We opted not to go with the Truffle extravaganza and each chose different dishes to be able to taste as many as we could.  Grilled sardines too bony for my taste but all flavors on point as were the wine pairings.  We'll be back! ",5
" This is hands down the best restaurant in Baltimore.  I’ve never had a bad bite of food there, let alone a bad meal. There are no bad choices. The only hard part is deciding what to order when everything is so incredible, one of those places where you wish you had 3 stomachs. The lobster bisque is a must. Cindy Wolf is a goddess. The wine list is overwhelming but part of the fun is talking with the sommelier. The atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable. It is very expensive but worth every penny. ",5
 Birthday celebration- Food was excellent as always!! ,4
" I've wanted to visit Charleston for years for many reasons, especially my love for Cindy Wolf and Tony Foreman's other restaurants around the city.  We finally made it for my 30th birthday and we were absolutely awestruck.  Every single staff member was exceedingly friendly and knowledgeable and the food was phenomenal.  Charleston is fine dining at its best, offering exceptional food and service in a beautiful atmosphere while avoiding an air of stuffiness or pretentiousness.  We each had the four courses, plus we added the optional cheese course and dessert.  The portion size and excellent crafting of each dish makes it possible to enjoy this amount of food without feeling completely stuffed.  Since the menu changes daily, I recommend asking your server to help steer you in your selections.  Our server (Patrick) helped me select all of my courses based on a few things I mentioned finding intriguing.  He even convinced me to try sweetbreads for the first time and they were absolutely incredible.  He also talked my Mom into changing one of her selections once he learned she is a shrimp and grits enthusiast; she typically doesn't order shrimp and grits north of the Mason-Dixon line, but she loved Charleston's twist on the old classic!  I enjoyed the wine pairings immensely, and my Dad was able to select a couple of half bottles for himself with the help of the incredible sommelier.  I also started off with a really creative and delicious cocktail (the Flowers and Honey cocktail).  We can't think of one single thing we'd change about this meal.  It was truly the best dining experience I've had in  Baltimore.  I highly recommend Charleston and can't wait for a reason to go back! ",5
" My husband and I lived in Germany for 13 years and have enjoyed Michelin rated restaurants all over Europe. We now live in the DC metro area and are excited to have found our new favorite ""special occasion"" restaurant right here in Baltimore! The food was amazing, the service was impeccable,and the wine pairings were perfection! ",5
" This was our first time at the Charleston and we will definitely be back! We paid a set ticket price which included food (five course meal), champagne pairing, our table for the night (it was New Years Eve), party favors, and gratuity.  This isn't the normal, as this was New Years Eve.  The preselected menu was different then anything my husband and I would have chosen and we were not disappointed, everything was delicious.  Portion sizes are small but, appropriate.  The wait staff was knowledgeable and extremely friendly in helping us pair champagnes.  The atmosphere was quiet and romantic with a low hum about the room, nothing overwhelming; the dining room had an air of quiet and intimate conversation and was incredibly relaxing. ",5
 Had a lovely time ,4
" Going into dinner I had high expectations based on this restaurant’s and chef’s  reputation, but was met with only modest delivery when tasting the food.  Sauces were thin, the table service was disjointed, and wait staff did not communicate well about the menu.  The service was sloppy - my first course was served before the wine was poured, and the wine did not get served until several minutes later.  Also the meal was not good value for the money  - dinner for 3 including wine, dessert, and tip was $480 - $160 per person.  However, I regularly eat in DC and NYC much better food for the same or even less money.   Not going to recommend this restaurant to others, which saddens me as a born and raised Baltimorean - no hometown pride here. ",2
" We celebrated our 1st anniversary at Charleston, and they made us feel as special as we wanted to be on that day. Everyone doted on us and made us feel appreciated and welcome. The food was outstanding -- we did the 6-course meal with wine pairings and we left there very full. ",5
" Great food, poor service.  We had to wait an hour past the time of our reservation even to be given our menus. In the meantime, cocktails were pushed upon us. The kitchen kindly offered us a dish while we were waiting to make up for it, but neither of us wanted what they served. We then had to repeatedly ask for things throughout the meal. When it arrived, however, the quality of the food and paired wine was very high. ",3
" Excellent food, excellent service, excellent experience. What else is there to say! ",5
" Thoroughly delightful dining experience, start to finish.  We did the 3-course menu plus a cheese course and the dessert course that comes with each order.  It was PLENTY for each of us (adult females).  Every single thing we ate is worthy of rave reviews, but I will give special mention to the chopped beet salad, which was divine.  Lovely service as well!  Altogether lovely evening. ",5
 I had my engagement here. Very accommodating and excellent service and staff. Great place for special function. ,5
 For a special night out Charleston’s is still the Best of Baltimore. ,5
" Have been trying to get reservations for a bit, always booked! Fantastic restaurant with great service! ",5
" It was our first time dining there. We had seen Chef Cindy on a Food Network show and wanted to try the Charleston, so we picked Christmas Eve. It was by far the best dining experience. We were seated in the small room facing the water (Domino Sugar sign was visible) and it was perfect. The staff was extremely attentive and the food was amazing. We will be back once we start saving up! ",5
" Our Christmas Eve dinner at Charleston was absolutely one of the most memorable to date.  The service was impeccable and the menu was well thought-out, delicious, and well-executed.  I enjoyed the oysters which are my absolute favorite.  The artichoke soup was one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth.  The goose and sweetbreads were both indulgent, neither as heavy as we would have thought - again perfection!  The sticky toffee pudding at the end was absolutely divine.  It was prepared in traditional English style which could not have been more perfect for Christmas Eve.  To sum up our evening would be to say that Charleston is all about exquisitely prepared food, outstanding service, and beautiful ambiance. ",5
 Fantastic experience. Wonderful food and service. Can not wait until next time. ,5
 A suburban restaurant with an urban feel. ,4
" Great food, relatively small proportions, quite noisy ",5
" the food is amazing, EVERY time we go!  great atmosphere too, although i prefer dining downstairs to the 'loft'!  absolutely delicious with fantastic service!! ",5
 Great restaurant in the burbs!  Feels like a NYC hot spot.  Wine list is nice but a little pricy. ,4
" Nectar offers a Starr-like experience in the suburbs: a sophisticated Asian-fusion menu, a hip atmosphere, and attentive but dignified and unintrusive service.  We have eaten there three or four times, and we will certainly be back. ",4
" I asked, via the message system of Open Table, if the restaurant could put a candle on our dessert because we were celebrating the birthday of my guest.  They did a beautiful job of writing Happy Birthday on the plate along with the candle. Thanks!! ",5
" We had a great time...and the food was awesome...I'm very picky with my sushi, it was perfect!! ",5
 Good food. Service is a little slow. So if you like to take your time and not to be rushed through your meal than Nectar is for you ,3
" ABSOLUTELY THE BEST...EXCELLENT FOOD, SERVICE AND ATMOSPHERE. MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT ",5
" Beautiful restaurant, made me feel warm and fuzzy just walking thru the front door.  Loved the valet parking so didn't have to walk far late at night.  Drinks were fabulous, dinner was even better.  One exception was that someone had a screaming child which ruined the ambiance of the place somewhat (or at least while she was screaming).  Can't blame the restaurant for that as they did all they could to quell the noise. ",5
" I was disappointed!  This was the first time at your restaurant, I asked the waiter for recommendations and missed the que.  He directed us away from the specials but I thought the wok beef and lobster sounded great.  The beef was tuff and the lobster over cooked.  Lost the waiter during and after the meal.  Just not attentive.  The mini donuts were the highlight of the meal but the coffee was only warm....had to find our waiter to get a replacement and by the time he got back the donut were all but gone.  Then had to wait for the check.  It was on a Sunday night with open tables, should not have been an issue for service.  Not sure why the food quality was poor but Roys is the alternative!! Sorry, maybe just picked a bad night. ",3
 Food is not as great as when the restaurant first opened. Need s a new menu. Ambiance is terrific. Service was ok. ,4
" We were a couple out for a date night and we were refered because this was suppose to be fine dinning.  For the price of our dinner it was far from a fine dinning expierence, we found the seating arrangement and noise to be obnoxious.  Our tables were so close on both sides of us that it was uncomfortable. My husband who is 5'9"" and built well had a hard time navagating between the tables to get to the rest room. ",1
 Good food but very expensive.  It is just chineese ,2
 Nectars is one of our very favorite restaurants.  I celebrate my birthday there every year. ,5
" I really enjoyed my night at Nectar.   I thought the food was fantastic, but if I had to find a complaint it would be that the French food was better than the Asian. I've had better sushi (though it was very good), and some of the inventive rolls seemed a little forced, with flavors that were interesting only in a strange way.  And the prices are pretty high.    But don't let that turn you off. This is great find and it is great for a special occasion. ",5
" A phenomenal restaurant. Great, great food and a great atmosphere to boot. We throughly enjoyed our night-out at Nectar. ",5
 Pricey but Great! ,5
" We were pleasantly surprised to find a restaurant with great food from a good, well priced menu, with a complementary wine list(although this was expensive).  The atmosphere was fabulous.  We will go again. ",5
 Nectar is always good atmosphere and great food!  The Wok Lobster was simply incredible!! ,5
 Great service-- great atmosphere-- food was great-- great experience ,4
 Nectar is a great restaurant for both lunch an dinner. Saturday night is extremely busy so even though we had a reservation still had to wait 15 min. Overall is one of the best places on Main line. ,3
" We started with the vegetable rolls which were very tasty.  They weren't overly special, but the sauce that they were sitting in was delicious.  They also had a nicer beer list.  I was able to order a very good vietnamese beer, 33 export.  For our main courses my wife got the vegetarian dish with chinese eggplant, broccoli, tofu and black bean sauce.  She enjoyed it very much.  I wanted to taste a couple of different things myself so I ordered two pieces of sushi (spicy tuna and spicy jumbo lump crap) and the basmati fried rice with curried chicken.  The sushi was excellent.  Very fresh.  The fried rice was good but alittle bland and nothing I would order again.  The next time we go I will order differently. Overall a very good meal. ",4
" When it is not crowded (when we arrived at 5:30), the music is very loud.  When it is crowded, the noise drowns out the music somewhat.  Not a quiet atmosphere, at least not in the downstairs dining area.  The food is excellent and the service was very good.  We thoroughly enjoyed our entrees and the side we shared.  The dessert was just okay.  House wine was decent for the price.  Cappuccino was good - hot and generously sized.  We will definitely go back soon. ",4
 Excellent as always!  Awesome servers.....cheers to Bau and Dennis! ,5
 we had such a great evening celebrating our 1 month wedding anniversary and the food was amazing! ,5
" This was our second visit. We enjoyed both very much, we brought our kids the second visit to celebrate a birthday. Both of them thought the food was awesome, very creative, keep up the good work. See you again soon. ",5
 We have been to Nectar many times and never tire of the menu.  We frequently choose from the specials and  have yet to be disappointed. The portions are perfect.  The desserts are light and easy to share. ,5
 A place to consider when looking for something unique to share with friends and looking for something different -- $$$. ,3
" Probably THE most overpriced underserved restaurant I've eaten at in 10 years.  Definitely, by far, the worst restaurant I've ever booked on opentable for the money.  Incredibly average food and average service for exorbitant prices. ",1
 Another FANTASTIC meal at Nectar. Asian fusion at it's best! ,5
" Fantastic food and great ambience. Always, consistently a winner. ",5
 The food was outstanding.  The restaurant and ambiance was very attractive ,5
 Fantastic! Great service and delicious food! ,5
" Nectar has a very modern, NYC restaurant feel when you walk in the door.  But before you get there you have to have your car parked by a valet - it's mandatory.  I find that detail a little absurd since the barking lot is the size of a bread box.  They take all the lower class cars and park them in the back, while the upper class cars gleam in the front.  Kind of silly and an air they put on that I don't think is necessary.  Apart from that, the Japanese cuisine is fused and interesting.  The night we went, they had nothing but lobster specials that seemed amazing.  We opted to share two sushi plates and they did not disappoint.  The tuna was not very fresh but otherwise everything was excellent.  Highly recommend saving room for dessert. ",4
" The atmosphere at Nectar is great and the wait staff are delightful-if the food matched it would be a truly awesome experience.  On the night of my last visit, my companion and I felt that the sushi appetizer was the best part of the meal, and the wok dishes were disappointing.  The jasmine smoked duck dish had too much oil in the wok for my taste.  The worst transgression though was that the signature Blood Orange Martinis contained a thimble full of vodka, and I wish we had sent them back.  When people order martinis they usually expect a drink with a kick, not some fru-fru drink with a splash of liqueur.  After that we ordered from the wine list, which is very nice indeed.  Next time I return, I'm eating sushi and ordering wine. ",3
 SERVICE WAS GREAT. FOOD WAS NOT AS GOOD AS LAST TIME I WAS THERE. I ORDERED THE SPARE RIBS(WICH I GOT LAST TIME AND THOUGHT THEY WERE GREAT) THEY WERE VERRY FATTY DIDNT EVEN EAT. DONT THINK I WILL RETURN. ,3
" Everything about our experience at Nectar was perfect.  Our waiter was wonderful, he helped guide us through the menu so we had the best items from the menu.  I would recommend Nectar to anyone looking for a Fantastic meal. ",5
" Good food, but pretty expensive ",4
" In the last 4 years, I tried most of the top restaurants in the area . Nectar is the best without any doubt. Food and service are oustanding anytime I go there for business and private reasons. Highly raccomended ",5
 Had to wait over 1/2 hour after scheduled reservation. Seemed overcrowded and no place to stand ,3
 Great food and selections. VERY pricey! $13 margarita and $30 entrees. ,4
 We have been patrons of this restaurant since it opened and we observed the quality of the food going constantly down. The sushi are mediocre at best and the wine list overpriced. Many times we brings guests out of town to this place and we are thinking that we should stop... ,3
 We adore nectar. A hit everytime. ,5
 I went to Nectar with 3 friends for lunch. My friends enjoyed the sushi immensely but there was only one sushi chef so it took a long time to get our order. We each had a glass of wine which I thought was overpriced ($9-$14) per glass but the glasses were only 1/4 full! The waiter was friendly and helpful but the chef's delays decreased our good impression of his service. The dining area of the restaurant is open and airy but the tables can be close together. ,3
" Great food, great service, great wine. I can't wait until we go back! ",5
" My date and I had a quaint, romantic dinner at Nectar on Sunday evening. The food, the service and ambience were outstanding. The restaurant was not crowded, although I hear it is on week nights. Nectar exceeded my expectations in every way! ",5
" Nectar is one of my favorite restaurants in the Philadelphia area and I have been going since they opened. Unfortunately, on my recent visit I found the service has gotten worse and the appetizer could be easily competed with an American low end chain restaurant. The main course was, fortunately, very good and presented well and the ambiance is as it always has been. ",3
" Food was good, but a little on the expensive side for what we received. Seating was too close together. We were able to hear the conversations on either side of us and our conversation could be heard by the tables on either side of us as well. Not a good setting for a private conversation. The restaurant was loud, which required us to talk loudly as opposed to a normal conversational voice. ",3
 The service was great but unfortunately my meal (Lobster Pad Thai) was not very good. It tasted very metallic. ,3
 Nectar is the hot restaurant near my home and office. I am regularly booking it for business meetings for lunch and dinner at regular tables and private room dining. We have never been disappointed. The decor is lovely. Henry and Ed run the front desk and do an outstanding job. Nectar also brings catered lunches to our office. The food is consistant and always extremely good be it catered or eaten on site. ,4
" The food is very good with a nice presentation but pricey. Service was very good. When I made the reservation, I asked for a quiet table and I thought the hostess accommodated my request. ",3
" The food was prepared with great attention to detail. Foodies will love this place. Great not having to drive into Philly to experience this atmosphere. Bau, our waiter, was fantastic. He was attentive and took pride in explaining each dish that was served. I don't think you will find better in the western suburbs. ",4
" Very enjoyable, a bit pricey, but great food. Unique menu, but everyone should be able to find something to enjoy. Able to carry on a conversation easily. ",4
 Always enjoy Nectar. Food was terrific. Waiter could have been a little more attentive. It was warm -- a little uncomfortable. ,4
 Nectar was great. We enjoyed our food. Love the menu. The pumpkin soup is fabulous. The service was good. ,4
" Nectar is a good but not great restaurant. It is great looking (Buddakan of the burbs) but very expensive. It's a cool, hip place to eat with above average food, but your wallet will be lighter after you leave. ",3
 Nectar is my go-to spot for consistently good food and a great atmosphere. It's suitable for a business meeting or a romantic date and the location is great. ,5
" Great, innovative food in a great atmosphere! Service was good and the ambiance at lunch was nice. ",4
" Nectar is consistently outstanding! The bar is always packed and the place is abuzz with the glitz of the Main Line. The sushi is beyond comparison, and the entrees are some of the most creative and delicious in the Philadelphia area. Try the flight of sake, and definitely get dessert! ",5
" Like all Stephen Starr restaurants, the food was exceptional but the restaurant is noisy. We asked for and got a table in a relatively quieter area, specifically, upstairs. ",4
 Have always been well taken care of when dinning at this resturant. The food and drinks have always been excellent. The service is alwyas outstanding. ,5
" EXPENSIVE, BUT WORTH EVERY PENNY. FORGET YOUR DIET AND ORDER DESSERT! THE DONUT HOLES WITH THE THREE DIPPING SAUCES IS A MUST. THE ONLY DRAWBACK IS THAT IT CAN GET VERY NOISEY. ",4
" I´ve been at Nectar two times before and the quality of the food was excellent, this time I was a little dissapointed, the calamari was extremelly chewy and my sea bass was cold. Desserts as always were amazing. ",2
" We are huge fans of Nectar - will definitely be back! The food is great - everyone at our table (4 total) got different apps and dinners, and everyone raved - not a bad bite all night! ",5
 Great food; I've been here before but not for a while. We really enjoyed. The service was attentive and friendly. ,4
" The facility is beautifully done and I like the valet parking. It was my husbands birthday and I asked for a quiet table. We were seated at the only table at the top of the stairs. It was a constant wave of other diners being seated in the upstairs dining room and waiters/staff rushing by. We asked to move to the sushi bar and we continued to dine there. The sushi was good but not great. My biggest disappointment was that the service was rushed and impersonal. The ""Happy Birthday"" cake was really great and a nice treat/surprise for my husband. ",2
" Coming from San Francisco and then Newport Beach, we have been around very good restaurants in the past years. To have a restauarant as consistently good as Nectar right here on the Main Line is truly wonderful. My husband and I usually choose to go there on our date nights and are never disappointed. It is very adult and always buzzing with good energy. The food is out of this world and so is the service. ",5
" Nectar is wonderful -- the atmosphere is sophisticated yet cozy, the food is outstanding Asian fusion with unique and tasty flavors, and the service was terrific (well balanced with helpfulness but not overbearing). The macadamian nut ice cream sandwich with lime ice cream and mango tempura was amazing. Definitely one of my favorite restaurants. ",5
" Excellent, creative food.   A bit too noisy.  Restaurant needs more quiet, intimate spaces. ",4
" Fun hot spot in the burbs.....over priced for not very good sushi, lousy appetizers.  Basically, I would never go back. ",2
" My wife and I have been to Nectar on several occasions and have enjoyed it each time.  The food is always a delicious. On this latest visit, it wasn't as busy as we've seen in the past, but still pretty lively.  Although this makes for a good energy level in the restaurant, it tends to be noisy. This was the first time that we were seated immediately upon arrival.  The service overall was excellent..     We had a nice time at Nectar and will go back again in the future. ",4
" Always consistant, always delicious. ",5
" A beautiful space to eat it, but way too loud. The quality of the food seems to be slightly less than what it was in the early days, but the prices continue to go up. Service, as always, was terrific. ",4
" What recession?  On a Thursday night I struggled to find a parking space!  Appetizer was outstanding as was my friend's entree.  Mine was just shy (4 1/2 stars).  My lobster was wonderful as were the perfectly cooked and flavored asparagus spears but the truffled mashed potatoes were just good.  The shared desert was again outstanding.  Service was prompt and friendly.  A spilled drink was replaced gratis.  Ambiance was downrated because it's a bit noisy.  Be aware that Nectar is EXPENSIVE!  Our tab for 2 including shared appetizer, two entrees, desert and tip was $190.  The wine list is expensive for bottles though the by-the-glass list (which we used) and beer list (which we used) were more reasonable.  Expensive but well worth it! ",5
" This restaurant was fantastic!  Although it was about $110 with tip and alcohol for myself and my husband, it was worth it!  The food was great, the portions were large and the service was fast!  They also comped us a free dessert since it was our anniversary.  It was a great restaurant for our special occasion, wish we could go there more often! ",5
" Great restaurant. Had sushi for app., and then the spicy beef medallions for entree. Very good on both accounts. Service was great, and the food is reliable as always. Looking forward to going back again! ",4
" EVERY TIME WE HAVE RESERVATIONS WE HAVE TO WAIT AT LEAST 45 MINUTES FOR OUR TABLE.  THIS TIME WE SAT AT THE BAR AND STARED AT AN EMPTY, SET TABLE AT WHICH WE WERE FINALLY SEATED AFTER WATCHING IT FOR 20 MINUTES. SEEMS LIKE THEY WANT TO BE CERTAIN THE CUSTOMERS RUN UP A BAR TAB. ",4
 Always great - great high-end lunch spot too. ,4
 A suburban restaurant with an urban feel. ,4
" My compliments to all of the staff, i.e. managers, front desk, wait-staff, and the chefs, etc. 5* ",5
" We liked it so much! First our steak came too cooked, but as soon as we tome them, they brought a perfect steak and changed the side orders for new hot ones!! Very nice of them. It was my husband’s Birthday and they brought him some chocolates and took us a picture which they gave us in a frame, very thoughtful !!  I love the place! ",5
 We had a lovely evening.  We went on Monday for the steak and lobster tail/king crab legs special.  It was an excellent value for the price.  Don waited on us and provided excellent service.  He also recommended a great wine.  Chef Kristopher prepared excellent steaks.  The desserts and truffles topped off my birthday celebration. ,5
 There are far better steakhouses that exist for the $. ,2
" Seven of us went for Restaurant Week so the value was good.  Had we paid regular prices, it would not have been such a great value.  Food was good but not amazing.  Our waiter was very friendly but not particularly attentive and often asked us to pass things rather than him walking to the other side of the table to serve us. ",3
 I chose to celebrate our 4th anniversary at Fleming’s.  We showed up thirty minutes early but was seated right away.  All the staff was very professional and greeted us by saying “Happy Anniversary”.  The server was very knowledgeable about the menu and drinks.  Our  dinner selection was excellent.  We received  a nice gift of chocolate truffles for our anniversary.  I definitely will recommend Fleming’s  to all my family and friends.  We will definitely comeback to celebrate other special occasions. ,5
 Wonderful date night with my husband!!! Would definitely go back ,5
 This was my second time at Fleming’s and I was very satisfied with the service and food.  Our service Mr. Jameson was efficient and welcoming.  He checked on us several times and food was prepared in a timely manner .  The carrot cake was very delicious. ,5
" Restaurant week in Baltimore extended by some establishments.   Lucky me as I'm a business traveler!  The selections for 3 course meal were good.  Steak cooked exactly how I like it, medium rare and selection of side included their cream of spinach which I love.  Never order dessert but came with prix fixe and enjoyed the cheesecake!  Service was exceptional too!  I'd come back again.  Also happy hour at the bar from 5-7! ",5
" We went for a Baltimore Restaurant Week dinner to celebrate a birthday. It seemed that Fleming's was straining to keep costs within the Restaurant Week budget. Main courses (steak, chicken) were good. But the menu options were minimal, and all but the main courses (i.e. bread plate, starters, sides, desserts) were OK but basic, without the typical Fleming's flair. The service was basic and somewhat rushed, and the main server's mind seemed to be elsewhere. But they did their birthday celebration thing, and we had an enjoyable evening. ",4
" The meal and service were excellent! Our waitress, Hama, was perfect. She produced the 3-course meal in very good time, kept our water glasses filled without our saying a word, brought us seconds on the delicious bread and dipping cheese sauce, and got our orders correct. We split two three-course meals. The Caesar salad  was the best we'd ever had with crispy prosciutto chips and tangy sauce. The main entrees of petite filet and  chicken breasts were cooked to perfection and so delicious. Dessert was refreshing. Even the valet parking was easy. Thank you Flemings for a very enjoyable dinner. ",5
 Great service all around! Delicious food and cozy environment! ,5
 The food was fantastic and the service was superb. This was our second time to Fleming’s and we would definitely return again. We were there for restaurant week and were thrilled we chose Fleming’s. We would recommend Fleming’s to anyone ,5
 Our server was phenomenal and the food was great. We are definitely coming again ,5
" We went for restaurant week. The deal was very good and the staff was super attentive. My tomato soup had a burnt flavor to it and my steak was slightly underdone, but overall, the meal and ambiance was very good. Our waitress, Brittney T. was excellent. ",4
 Visited for restaurant week and the food was great. Service was top notch with an attentive waiter but not overly so. I would recommend Fleming’s for special occasions. ,5
" My husband and I dined at Flemming’s for date night! We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves! Our server Donnie was a true gentleman, professional and made our night perfect! The Chef Partner Tyronne also stopped by our table, which was a treat!  We will definitely be back! ",5
" Everything was phenomenal. Food, service, ambiance. Went for an anniversary and they truly made it a special night for you ",5
 Really enjoyed ou dinner at Fleming’s  — their restaurant week menu was excellent and was a tremendous value.  Highly recommended! ,5
 Amazing! Our server was incredible and food was equally impressive. ,5
" The food, the service, and the atmosphere were outstanding. This is a very good spot for a beautiful meal. ",5
" long wait for drinks, $12 absolute and cran, beer not very cold. steak was no better than  home grilled. does not compare to RC's steak but the price is about the same. ",1
 Very good food and good waiter.  Went on Price Fix and was very happy with everything that we got.  Will definitely be back. ,5
 Waitress was excellent ,5
" Service was impeccable.  We were seated in a back room, so it was quiet which was nice.  The food was good, appetizers were very good - better than the steaks we ordered.  Filet Mignon was a little on the dry side.    We were there for my husband's birthday, so they were very nice, with a card and a complimentary table photo and a box of truffles.    This is not a bad review, because we had a nice time and the service was phenomenal and the food good....But I think the prices are too high for what they deliver.  I ordered the restaurant week  menu ($35), we were three people and the total bill (tax and tip included) was $365.  1 Glass of wine - $31.50??    1 mixed drink - $13.95??  But in addition we paid $15 each for parking.  There were no signs indicating another place to park for $5, and we parked in the same lot that an employee had parked in.  The same one who directed us to get to the restaurant, and then told us at the end when I wanted to get our parking ticket validated for the $5 parking that we parked in the wrong lot!!!!  Wow.   I wish she told us when we first parked... ",3
 Great!!Should have prime rib every day or at least throughout the weekend ,5
" My wife and I was at Fleming's on Saturday January 13, celebrating her birthday. This was our 5th visit to the restaurant. We are always very satisfied and well taken care of, when we visit. The food is always cooked to our satisfaction and the service is second to none. This time, our server was ""Hawa"" and she was superb. Very attentive to our needs. Her knowledge of the menu items was good. Because of the quality of food and the service your employees offer is the reason we will continue to visit your restaurant in Baltimore, Md. And by the way, I will say, we do not live in Baltimore and have to travel approximately 1 3/4 hrs to Baltimore. ",5
" Food is great, staff was friendly and helpful, nice place to go for a date or to go out with friends ",5
" I had the aged ribeye steak, and it wasn't very good: overcooked and the meat didn't taste great. The Brussels sprouts were horrible!!! However, the service and valet was great ",3
" Celebrated my wife's birthday. Mentioned this when I reserved a table, and from the moment we arrived until we left the entire staff was courteous, friendly, and professional; as well, wished my wife a happy birthday. Service was quick, accurate, and welcoming, the food was delicious, and the house beer was very smooth and tasty. The manager took a complimentary photo of us, and framed it so that we could share the memories! (Nice touch!) We are definitely going to return, and highly recommend this gem! ",5
 Awesome evening the food was fantastic and everyone treated us very nice. ,4
 The evening was perfect! The bartender was amazing ehilenwe waited for outer table and our server was amazing. He recommended the Prime Rib dinner and it was delicious. We had to take our dessert to go. ,4
" Amazing food, amazing service! Had a wonderful time. ",5
" Great time, great food and best waiter - Don F.  Thanks for everything! ",5
" A typical chain restaurant.  Steaks were very good, but the rest of the food was average.  Server was very nice and attentive at first, but forgot about us at the end of the meal.  There was nothing super special about the experience that would encourage us to go back.  There are many other steak restaurants in a Baltimore that we would rate higher. ",3
" A slight let down from last visit. We had a 5pm reservation and had to wait approx 5 mins after arrival because they were still polishing glasses on the tables! The place opens at 5pm for dinner so this should have been done prior to opening. Hostess didn't have stickers for validating parking tickets. Our waiter, Don, was friendly and gave us good service.  As far as the food, the French Onion soup was burned on the top! Charred cheese and onion.  I sent it back! Was surprised a restaurant of this caliber would send it out. The food runner brought it out but I feel it never should have left the kitchen. The replacement soup was better but I suspect they just took the broth and put it in another bowl with new cheese. It did have a slight burnt taste to it.  I won't order it again! Caeser salad was good as well as the Sea Bass. Hubby's steak was great - cooked perfectly and full of flavor. Fleming's potatoes were good as well and plenty for 2 people to share. ",4
" The level of personal attention and warm welcome was exceptional, as well as the service, food and ambiance.  This is a wonderful steakhouse. ",5
 Worse experience ever at Fleming’s.  Service was slow.  Portions were small—not worth the money.  Sea bass entree was like an app size ,2
" Was looking forward to a date with my wife when Flemmings happened.   I ordered a filet medium rare, which is my desired temp for any steak.   Our waiter (great guy) asked us to cut our steaks to make sure they were cooked correctly.  Before I could even get through the steak the waiter said it was raw, which it was, and he would have them put it back on the grill for a few minutes - ok no big deal.  Except, no one came back to get the steak.  My wife order a filet and added a lobster tail to her meal.  The lobster tail was over cooked beyond the point rubbery and all the way to tough.   I ate around the edges of my steak and we only ate a few bites of the lobster which is not the quality or experience you want when you are paying roughly $300 for two people to go to dinner.  My wife and I joked and laughed our way through the meal (one of the many reason why I love her) but we aren't likely to go back to Flemmings any time soon. ",2
" Fleming’s has been go to for our family since 2001. We have had birthday, graduation and Christmas celebrations there.  Server was incompetent and the manager on duty was arrogant.   There was a total of six people and four only ordered steaks.  After two hours I had to ask for the check twice and finally it came with a total of $241. Total rip off no comps for appetizers or drinks.  Not going back - ",1
" A business meal extended into a 3 hour event due only to extremely slow service. The food was wonderful, but it was hard to focus on it with the terrible service. ",3
" Delicious food, generous quantities and great service. Would definitely recommend it! ",5
" Great food, great service, great  atmosphere  Would like to visit regularly but was just to expensive  For us! ",4
 Great food but very small portions.  Slow kitchen and fair service.  Definitely overpriced.  We ended up going out afterward to get something additional to eat at another location. ,4
 We love eating at the Whiskey Rebellion.   Always good food and service. ,5
 This was out first visit and we were very pleased. The chef came out and greeted customers which was a really nice touch. He clearly takes pride in this restaurant and places a high value on customer satisfaction. The food was delicious and we loved trying the various whiskeys. ,5
 Food and drinks were good. Our server Elisabeth was really sweet and attentive to us. It was a great meal overall! ,4
" Good food, I had a chicken and vegetables soup and the Shepherds Pie. It was very good. My friend had the Crab Cakes (gluten fre, very good) and we had the chocolate cake (gluten free, delicious). Overall a nice experience. ",4
 Excellent Food; whiskey tasting menu is outstanding. Must buy the Scorpion Salt fries. You will not be disappointed. ,5
" Best place around. We are here all the time!! Best Reuben sandwich around, hands down!! All the food is excellent!! ",5
 We were beyond impressed with the service and our meals.  Drinks and desserts were excellent as well. The Chef came to our table to talk about specials and ask about our meal afterwards. Our waitress was very friendly and full of energy. ,5
" The chef came around to visit all the tables.  The waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu.  Once we had the manager up the heat, we were very impressed with our experience! ",5
 Menu was great. But ....   We Barely had started our salad when the entrees were brought to the table. The  Crabcakes were warm but not hot.   Ambiance and historic presentation were both very agreeable.   Having said all that will try again next time in Carlisle ,3
" The food was very good!  There was a monitor on the wall with a slide show of pictures of the restaurant that took away from the ambience. Very pleasant server but not attentive. We were the first of 3 tables seated in the dining room. The other two tables, one of which sat eight guests, were served before we were. We were in no hurry but did have to ask the server of the other 2 tables for a drink refill. ",3
" Atmosphere was very nice, food tasted fine but was lacking  in quantity. We ordered the double-portion fries app., which didn't feel like a double portion price (for $10). I then ordered the Shepard's Pie...it came our in a very small dish and was primarily mashed potatoes with a little root veggies and two bites of meat. Again, tasted fine, just expected much more for the price ($19). Then ordered cheesecake for dessert and again, a small piece was served. For the record, I did not complain about the portions to our waitress, but wish I would have. ",3
 Food was delicious and restaurant was beautiful l but the service was poor and for that reason alone I won't be back. ,3
 They use mostly local farms and always free food.  The chef there is second to none.  I would recommend this place to everyone. ,5
 I loved this restaurant.  But we had to gain access to the restaurant with a disabled person.  It is very difficult to bring in an elderly person with all the cars stacking up anxious to get through the alley to the garage.  It would be helpful to have a hotel staff member there to assist and keep the people in cars behind you a little more patient so you can safely bring in your handicapped person. ,5
" 1794 Whiskey Rebellion has been one of our favorite spots since our first visit.  During our recent visit, we were told as soon as we were seated that ""they"" needed our table for a second seating and could we watch our timing !  This has never happened to us and the restaurant was not filled !  There were many open tables.  We were told then when asked a bit later that, ""oh, we didn't get as many guests as we thought we would"".  Not cool. ",4
 Our first trip but not our last. we will be back. the food was exceptional.  When the chef walked around to ask us about our meal you could tell that he wanted to serve the best local food that he possibly could. Check on line there are different specials every day.  I could talk all day about the food but the best way to find out is to go and try the food yourself.  You will not regret it! ,5
" Food taste was good but the portion sizes were very small.  Relatively high price exacerbated the small portion sizes.  Recommend substantially amping up the side items that go with the main entree item.  Carlisle has several restaurants that offer more food for less that tastes great.  Although not a bad experience, not sure that we will return to Whiskey Rebellion with the other options that Carlisle offers. ",3
 I love this restaurant been a few times food was a little below their average but still good ,4
 The personal attention paid to customers by Chef Jeff is awesome! ,5
" Took our daughter for dinner here  during our daughter' college family weekend. They are very nice at the restaurant, and service was good. Food was good too. The salmon dish was prepared well, but the chicken pot pies were just okay. The warm cookie dessert was delicious. ",3
" Novel and a vast improvement over previous efforts in this space, but way over priced. ",4
 Overall great place. The chef took time during service to greet and thank every table that was there. Food was well priced and portions were larger than expected. Local focus is great. Will go again!! ,4
" First experience, neat concept. Able to eat outside, road noise significant but we knew it would be and wasn't a problem for us. Love that patio is dog friendly. Food and drink good, beer was a little warm for our taste, but we think food was overpriced given casual atmosphere and location. Two large parties came in and that's when service went to almost a stand still. Parking was convenient on street or directly behind with garage. ",4
 We truly enjoyed our visit.  This was a second time.  Keep this place for special occasions.  Erika could not have been more gracious!  Food was outstanding!  A total local gem for sure!  Will be back again! ,5
 This place has great ambiance and a great menu but the highlight was the chef who came out to meet everyone and talk about his dishes. I really enjoyed dining here and look forward to returning! ,4
 This was our second visit. The food is excellent and so is the ambiance. We will return whenever we are in Carlisle. ,5
" We arrived with a big welcome, our wait person was really nice. Our drinks 1 Manhattan 1 dirty Vodka were an 8 out of 10. We went right to the main course I had a Rib Eye and my wife had a steak medallions both were very good they were cooked to our selection and the meat had very good taste. The value of food and drink was very reasonable. Try the place you will enjoy. ",4
 Everything from appetizers to dessert was fantastic!  My steak was cooked to perfection and the whiskey sour was one of the best I've had. ,5
" The food was great, the service was lack luster.  One of our drinks was not what was ordered and our waitress seemed to have her mind else where even though it wasn't that busy.  Again, food was awesome but drinks and especially the amount of bourbon given each time left a lot to desire. ",4
" The night before  our son checks in at Dickinson College for the first time. Met his new roommate and family! Great spot to talk, eat and get to know one another! ",5
 We had a wonderful meal! Great service and a wonderful experience all around! Thank you ,5
" My friends ordered the crab cakes and medallions . Delicious! I ordered the Chicken Pot Pie which was great. Had two martinis, which were fab! Highly recommend WR for food and drinks! I'll be back . ",5
 Loved the farm to table offerings.  Had local trout which was good. Sides were cool in some areas and warm in another. They were disappointing. Mostly overlooked. The soup was excellent but could have been warmer. ,4
" Good food, very friendly staff that want to please, nice atmosphere. ",5
" We enjoyed our time at the 1794 Whiskey Rebellion. Great atmosphere, really good service, steaks were good, but not great. Overall, we had a good dining experience and a nice evening out. ",4
 Staff is very friendly; setting is historic; food is outstanding and whiskey tasting on Wednesday lots of fun! ,5
" Really clean great portion size,wait staff  great !  only enjoyed the dining room,did not get a chance to visit the bar area or upstairs! ",5
 Very nice atmosphere. Sunday morning brunch was quiet and relaxing. ,5
" Food was delicious! each item was unique and tasty, starting with basic appetizers and ending with dessert.  Staff were courteous, knowledgeable, and helped us to feel comfortable.  We were a larger group of ladies with a little bit too much laughing and fun going on, but wait staff did not make us feel rushed or that we needed to be quiet. ",5
" Birthday dinner. Very expensive for the quality of food. Servings were small. My steak arrived undercooked, cold, and full of gristle and fat. I should have sent it back but didn’t want to put a damper on the evening. Other meals were OK, but not what I expect for the prices. ",3
" My wife and I took our son and his girlfriend for dinner on our sons recommendation. It was a great time and the food was fantastic. My wife and son had the halibut, it was excellent. The lobster roll I had was filled with meat very tasty. My son's girlfriend had the burger and was satisfied with the meal. Our waitress was very attentive and always present to fulfill our needs. All in all a great experience. ",5
" We waited an unusually long time before our order was taken. Then, our food took a long time coming. There were only about 10 other people in the restaurant. Our server handed us our drinks with her fingers on the top of the glass. My pastrami Rueben had large pieces of fat in it. I took my sandwich apart to remove the fat and then reassemble it. My wife’s salad was wilted. She ate the salmon and left the greens. My daughter-in-law sent her chicken back nearly untouched because she didn’t like it.  You would think the server would recognize the fat on my plate, wilted greens not eaten, and an entire meal sent back, and suspect there were things wrong with our meals. I expected the manager would have come to our table to see what was wrong - but no.  I had been to the Mill just weeks after it opened. I wasn’t happy with the service or meal on that occasion, and never returned until this visit. I thought maybe I would see improvements. I didn’t.  Not to mention, you’re prices are a bit high for what you sever. You’re not a gourmet restaurant, but charge gourmet prices. I doubt I will ever come back. ",3
" We requested seating good for conversation and weren’t disappointed. The lowest of the 3 levels was a cozy space divided into a bar area and general dining. We sat a booth near the bar but were not disturbed at all by any noise. The menu selections were varied and interesting. I chose scallops which were perfectly prepared over pasta. For dessert, I shared a blueberry bread pudding that satisfied my sweet tooth without being overbearing or too rich. Service was exceptional! ",5
 Been here many times for business dinners and the food never disappoints.  They always have interesting cocktails to choose from and local beers and wines.  Nice atmosphere and very pretty building. ,5
 Chad did an awesome job as our server. He was very informative and has a great personality. This was our first experience and we will defiantly be back. The food was absolutely delicious. Fresh and so flavorful. ,5
 I went thinking it was a buffet brunch but it was just a brief menu ,4
" First time there and it didn't disappoint. From arriving early and being seated early to Bridget's friendly smile and spot on suggestions, the place separated itself from other restaurants in the area. Looking forward to eating there again. ",5
 Food was rather strange. No flavor to the burger... weird take on classic dishes. We will not be returning. ,1
 Love this place!  Amazing food w excellent service! ,5
" The Mill has an excellent menu, in theory.  It is hit or miss.  Some days it's the best food for the area, other days it's not worth the money.  Descriptions and portions are sometimes misunderstood.  They served their Cheese Tray appetizer on a regular dinner plate, which I thought was odd.  Food was at the right temperature and wine was super cheap in compared to what it was billed for.  I'm willing to guess it was a $15/bottle for $23/glass.  Easy fixes. ",4
 Chad our server was very good.  The food was decent ,1
 Steak was ok but over cooked. I would rather pay more for better quality.   Also the brisket chili topped baked potato totally overpowered everything on the plate. ,3
 Quality of food I would say is excellent! (could be a little more generous on portion sizes!) Service was excellent. Racheal was great and on top of everything! Drinks are a little overpriced but all in all it was a great night out with friends! ,5
 Great meal and service in a neat atmosphere.  Glad we picked this place over others. ,5
 Great food and great atmosphere ,5
 Very yummy food and great service! ,5
 Was not worth the price. ,3
" Our family of 4 enjoyed another amazing meal at The Mill.  Service was great and the food was AMAZING, as always. ",5
 Would highly recommend the Mill to anyone looking for good food with good service.  Everyone in our group said they would definitely like to go back! ,5
" Very rustic environment. Good food and good service. Would like more to the menu, but overall a good selection. Can be noisy at times though if you are below by the bar area. ",4
 My husband and I went here to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We were seated upstairs where it was quieter. There was an envelope on the table containing an anniversary card signed by the employees. Our server was Sam and she was very friendly. We both had steak dishes. The food was amazing! My husband ordered the chocolate peanut butter pie for dessert. He loved it! Highly recommend this place to celebrate your special occasion. ,5
 The meal was presented well but lacked some flavor.  The cost of the meal was a bit too high. ,4
 The crepes were delicious. The brisket was a bit dry and tough. ,4
" Great place, good food, wonderful atmosphere, will definitely return. ",5
" I got the crab cakes w/ polenta and roasted veggies. The crab cakes were perfect, very little, if any filler. The polenta was a hard triangular cut cake and virtually flavorless. The veggies were cut into varying sizes and the larger cuts (e.g. Carrots/parsnips,etc.) were hard and not cooked long enough. The smaller cut veggies were ok, but each bite was hit or miss so eventually I just gave up on them.   He got the ""low &amp; slow brisket"". The brisket came out luke warm to downright cold in spots, which made it difficult to appreciate the full flavor. Rather than make a fuss, he just ate what he could. The Mac &amp; cheese was warm and no complaints about the broccoli rabe. Basically about 1/2 the meal was boxed. ",3
 Great brunch. ,5
" Not a terrible experience, but had high expectations. Open floor plan makes it loud and cold.  People were dining in their coats. Food was okay, but was expecting better quality for the price. The two crab appetizers weren't cleaned all the way; we were getting bites of shell. Large portion sizes a plus for leftovers. ",3
 We took our grandparents for a special treat. Our grandmother is unable to walk stairs and they happily accommodated us downstairs. They loved every single part of their dinner! ,5
" Went for a NYE dinner. Fantastic food and great cocktails. Our waitress was very friendly, but often forgetful and a little slow. It took a good 20 minutes after I gave my credit card for the bill for her to return. We didn't mind though. It was a great night enjoying family. Only true disappointment was that there was not a bread pudding dessert that night. Typically the bread pudding is one of the highlights of a trip to the mill. ",5
" Very nice building and ambience. Portions were well below expectations, and very pricey. Nothing to make me want to go back. Service was average. The only good thing was we were seated immediately upon arrival. ",3
" We always enjoy our dinner...love the appetizers and soups. We order the oysters, every time. Fantastic service!! ",4
" We went for New Year's eve. They had a tiny special menu with about six entrées to choose from, one of which was a pork dinner. I thought that was kind of silly because normally you eat pork on New Year's Day. They had no steak dinner at all. We left hungry  because the portions were tiny. . ",3
" My husband and I went to the Mill on New Year's Eve.  We had a wonderful experience!  The waitress was exceptional- very attentive, pleasant, and knowledgeable about the food (especially new menu items).  Our meals were fantastic in all areas- quality, taste, and presentation.  I had the crab cakes which had an abundance of crab meat and no filler with root vegetables that were beautiful and flavorful.  My husband's pork loin was presented very tastefully, and was delicious.   We will definitely be back! ",5
" Reservation was wrong, food did not meet usual standards-filet was cold and a very thin cut, crab cake was full of shells. Rather than split the checks all charges were put on one card. It was New Year’s Eve but it was early and not very busy. Not the usual Mill dining experience. ",1
 Very nice place ,5
 Place is beautiful and the live music was great! Food was good not great and portions were very small for the price. Dessert was very small for the price as well. ,4
" Excellent food at a good price.   The daily special is very inexpensive and was very, very good ",5
 We really enjoy the menu at Irv’s! ,4
 Back for probably the 8th time. Never disappoints. The food and atmosphere here is shockingly good. The Irv’s burger is one of the best I’ve had in the area. We will definitely keep coming back! ,5
 Food and drinks were amazing. The staff and customer service is excellent! ,5
 Worst food ever. The lobster was not real and the scallops had a horrible taste ,1
" I've visited 5 times, every time a great experience, equally enjoyed by my guests. Love the Brussels sprouts... Great entrees. Last time I tried the burger and it was fantastic. I had to consciously slow down, or I'd have eaten it whole ",5
" Saturday night was our sixth or seventh time at Irv’s, we invited some friends who had never been there before. We arrived at 7:30 for our 7:45 reservation and ended up eating at the bar at 8:30 as we were still waiting for a table - I’m sure the other couple we invited  won’t be back. The food and service was very good as always, the wait left a bad taste in everyone’s minds. ",2
" Server was pleasant and efficient. Ambiance was visually nice. Got very loud about 30 minutes into visit......and then they were having live music on top of that! Food was disappointing. Brussels sprout app was very good......crispy and seasoned well. That’s pretty much where it ended. Beef stroganoff was awful.....it was gray and kind of gelatinous looking. I gave it a whirl anyway, but it was under seasoned, the beef was........weird (also gray and almost looked like pork), and there was way too much sauce on it. Looking back, I should have sent it back and asked for something else, but I don’t want to be “that person.” My husband had the beet salad with goat cheese and some steak on it. The beef was cooked to temp and had good seasoning, but the beets on his salad were a weird texture and had no flavor (almost like they had been fresh at one point, frozen, and then thawed again??). We have had some great food here in the past, but wonder if the change in ownership has affected their product? Would perhaps go back for standard burger or simple sandwich, but won’t venture too far off thet path. ",3
" LOVED the atmosphere and food! Service was a little slow, but chalked it up to eating dinner in the bar area.Will definitely be back soon! ",4
" Fantastic food, service and ambiance. Cozy atmosphere. Need reservations ",5
" We’ve been to Irv’s a few times. Menu is creative, but food has been hit-or-miss (like many Hershey-area restaurants). Sadly, the most recent visit was more of a “miss.” Fried chicken came recommended, but was not as flavorful as I’d hoped — and serving the dish on a cutting board made for a messy meal. It didn’t help that my drink of choice wasn’t available the evening we went. ",3
" Good food, but very few vegetarian options. The drinks are lovely and the happy hour deals are great. ",4
 was disappointed ordered pork tenderloin was not available was still in the smoker . Had scallops and lobster as an alternate our server was excellent the atmosphere was excellent ,5
" What can i say nice environment, fair prices,  great food, great staff and Management. Done! ",5
" Good food, drinks, service. Burgers and sandwiches especially good, and some really nice soups and salads. ",5
 Pleasant dinner with friends. Appetizers and entrees ranged from excellent to adequate. Service was very prompt and helpful and not intrusive. Interesting ambience with several small rooms containing comfortable tables and chairs. Would come back again. ,4
" Went on a girls lunch. Service was great at the start, but then wasn’t great at the end. We all had 10 off coupons and they would only honor one per table but we had separate checks. Annoying. Food was delicious! ",4
 I have been to Irvs lots of times. One time the brussel sprouts were over salted. This time the tots were over salted and I ordered a cappuccino and received an espresso. Bit disappointed. ,3
" Second time at Irv's, this time for New Year's Eve dinner.  Did not disappoint with lovely scallop appetizer, beet salad which was refreshingly light on the dressing, followed by surf and turf main. I live in San Francisco and this restaurant would stand up well against many city restaurants that cost double the price. ",5
 Delicious New Years Eve Meal! Amazing food and drinks! ,5
 Amazing as always have such a great New Years Eve thank you Irvs Pub :) ,5
" The food was great (we had surf &amp; turf and beef stroganoff - both were excellent).  I highly recommend the blistered brussel sprouts as an appetizer!   The room was a little chilly, but it was also freezing temperatures outside.  The service was great and we got our food quickly. ",5
 New Years Eve meal ,5
" Burger was great, tater tot nachos were tasty and creative.  Charcuterie plate was less than stellar, glorified giant meat tray for $13.  Pear mojito didn't have strong pear flavor but was very good! ",5
 A great family meal ,5
 We enjoyed great food in a cozy setting. Excellent service. ,5
 Kind and inviting host and servers Perhaps they were just extra busy during the holidays but our food was served cold Very different from our prior meal here and hope we just caught them on an off day ,3
 My family met my boyfriend's family for the first time. The ambiance was great. ,5
" Only could do 3 stars as the food was not as good as in the past. The blistered brussel sprouts were the best part of the the meal. The entries were good but nothing special. But do not order dessert, they were not good and very disappointing. S'more brownie was hard as a brick and the cheesecake parfait was fluffy nothing with dry graham cracker crumbs. Hope they can get back to creating better food. ",3
" Not a fan at all the second time around.   We dined here for brunch about a year and a half ago and loved it. We couldn’t wait to return.  This time around we left extremely underwhelmed and will probably not return.  I’ve read online that they changed owners and based off our experience it may be true.   Everything we ate was in desperate need of seasoning. I’m talking the basics here, salt &amp; pepper.  Deviled eggs:  egg was delicious; no seasoning on the fried oyster.  Seafood chowder:  needed s a ton of salt and pepper.  This was very bland. Whoever cooked the chowder did not taste it before it was served.  This was the worst thing we ate.  Beef stroganoff:  needed salt and pepper.  The water used for the eg noodles was obviously not seasoned.  Again, very bland.  Fish &amp; chips:  the chips were seasoned beautifully, but the fish was not nor was the batter for the fish was seasoned.    You don’t have to be a CIA trainer chef to understand basic seasoning.    On the other hand, service was very friendly and the drink menu is great.  They just need a different chef.  Too bad....... ",2
 We were traveling and this caught our eye and great little place with great food and service!! ,4
" Wonderful Christmas lunch today at Irvs! What a treat the Fish and Chips were well....off the hook! The portions are huge but the flavor and quality are the best and cannot be beat! Tried the Reuben with the home made house potatoe chips, it was delicious. Know this if you go to Irvs, you will get great service, fresh ingredients, and I mean fresh and prepared by someone talented who knows how to prepare and present their offerings. This place is truly a hidden gem! ",5
 Good food and beautiful place to have a nice quiet lunch or dinner. ,4
" My husband I have been to Irv’s many times with great experiences, so I wasn’t expecting a near fail. Our wait for the meal on an uncrowded afternoon was very long (35 mins.). The meal itself was inconsistent on quality. ",3
" The Irv's burger was phenomenal! Probably the best burger I have ever eaten. The drinks were exceptional, too. ",5
 Great food and service always at this restaurant! I made a reservation on OpenTable and was seated right away. Love the ambiance and quality of food there. The servers are very knowledgeable and helpful and the food was delicious! I've never had anything there I didn't like! ,5
 Enjoyed lunch with friends. Especiallyially liked the deviled eggs with fried oysters ,4
" Very quiet, picked based on ratings from others. Visited Hershey for a TSO concert and wanted to dine at somewhere nice.  Food options had something for everyone in our group of 4. ",4
" I wanted to like this place so much! The food was not terrible, but certainly not worth the money spent. We all (5 of us) found the food to be bland. The service was on par with the food. Not at all bad, but not necessarily good. The ambiance is great (aside from the couple close to making out a few tables over, but that's not the fault of the restaurant!). I will try again when the menu changes seasons, but first impressions were 'meh, don't need to go back.' ",3
 I've been to Irv's 3 times now and every time the food  and service have been outstanding.  Everything is quite wonderful except for the noise level.  It gets quite loud...unfortunately.  But definitely worth a try!! ,5
" An excellent meal, great salad, very good fish &amp; chips, good portions, nicely presented. ",5
 Bowman burger... Bowman salad.. pot pie..  French dip... salmon and pork chop all very good.  Service and atmosphere very good. ,4
 Really excellent food in a cozy atmosphere!  The service was amazing and friendly!! ,5
" We come to this restaurant about every two months with the same couple sit at the same table, have the same quantity of Blood Mary's and most often order the same entrée. We have Michelle as our waitress who does an outstanding job, always anticipates our every need is extremely friendly. We could easily make her part of the foursome. Bowman's is an hour ride for us in PA and an hour ride for the other couple from NJ so it is real convenient. We will be back soon again. ",5
" We enjoyed waiting for our friends and reservation time in the bar. Friendly place and good tv's for games.  We were seated promptly and attended to quickly. We were never rushed through dinner and conversation. Lamb sandwiches were a little dry but never had them before. Drinks were great, other dinners were very good. Would definitely return. Very comfortable. ",5
 Bowman’s is one of my favorite dining places. Delicious food and wonderful service.  Everything on the menu is amazing. The bar area is always friendly and there is a lot of energy. ,5
 Bowman’s is one of our local go to favorites. Great place to meet friends for a drink or have dinner. There is music nightly however if that’s not your thing they have several dining rooms so the noise level is not so bad. We typically eat their burgers and salads. That said everything on the menu is delicious.  We highly recommend Bowman’s. ,5
" Everyone was attentive and friendly, from the host, bartender &amp; server.  Food was reasonable &amp; delicious. ",5
 Staff always makes you feel like family.  Great place to go if you enjoy live music while you dine. ,5
 Very good service. Fried oyster weren’t as good as before the breading was to thick but good aoli ,4
" Mellow atmosphere with live music (we went on a Saturday night and there was a good jazz trio).  We were seated in the back room so we could not hear the music while we ate, so we sat at the bar afterwards to listen for a while.  The food was very good, very reasonably priced, and the vibe was relaxed and friendly.  Coming from NYC for a weekend away, this was the perfect way to spend an evening. ",4
" I love Bowman's Tavern.  The food is so good and the staff is always very friendly.  The only criticism I would give is that it often take too long to get our check.  We're not ones to sit around once we've finished eating so ... other than that, Bowman's Tavern is a favorite. ",4
" Great as always.  Superb food, service, prize.  The warmed up desert brownie is to die for! ",5
" We've been here many times and enjoyed the food and the service. This time we came especially because there were specials that we wanted to try. They start the special menu on Friday and run out of specials by Wednesday or so. So this time we went on Monday, figuring that we were safe. Not so! They were already out of the fish special, which I had intended to order! This was a big disappointment. I ordered the beef stew special, which was OK, and my husband had the veggie burger (also OK), but it wasn't the fun occasion that it usually is. Not sure how soon we'll be back, and we were going there at least once a month! ",3
" Delicious food, cozy and friendly ,  in beautiful area of Bucks County. ",5
 Enjoyed it ,4
 Excellent Gastro Pub. Food is outstanding and the service is great. ,4
 Bowman’s tavern is a hit every time we go! Food is always delicious- cooked to order. Ambiance is lovely. ,5
" Overall it was not one of our better experience here, been here about a dozen times. We came to celebrate two friends birthday tonight. We did noted when we made the reservation on open table  and no one noticed or cared about it. I saw the note on their screen.  Most disappointing was that the waitress was inattentive and she had to keep asking for water and she wasn’t really around. We did enjoy the ambience which is why we keep coming back. Food was decent. ",4
" Nice restaurant with lots of options for dining areas. An outside area for dining, Sports Bar area, second dining room bar with live music, and a dining room. The best burgers by far I have ever had. We sat in the dining bar area which was very nice. Live music- The Guitarist was not overbearing. Celebrating our anniversary and wanted a low key place to just sit back and chill.  Staff was extremely attentive. ",5
" Had an early Sunday dinner , it was packed. The valet parking is very helpful. Had some nice music. Great server, Danielle. Meal was really good. The salmon was cooked perfectly, a nice steak and tasty scallops.  We’ll be back! ",4
 Always enjoy our meals at Bowman's Tavern.  Great staff.  Great food.  Great drinks. ,5
 Always good food and service! ,5
" Great meal, comfortable atmosphere. ",5
 I think this is going to be my new favorite local restaurant.  We all thoroughly enjoyed and our server was excellent! ,5
 Good food and good service like always. Our first time for lunch. Always a ‘go to’ place. ,4
 We had a great time! The menu was surprisingly diverse: from burgers and salads to beef and fish dinner entrees.  My parter had meatloaf and I ordered grilled salmon. The portions were generous and moderately expensive -by Philly standards. Cocktails were well also mighty fine.   The service was efficient and friendly. The dessert offerings all looked good: our molten chocolate lava cake with ice cream was double the portion  we’d get in Philly and well worth the splurge! We will return! ,4
 Another great visit to Bowman’s Tavern with our son.  Delicious food and drinks and perfect service.  We love it every time we visit. ,5
 Took my girlfriend for our 1st date there 3 years ago and haven't missed since and won't miss. Great tradition-nice place-great service.   Great Girl. ,5
" Went for a dinner with friends, food was great, service was great, and there was live music. Would definitely recommend to those looking for a fun, cozy time. ",5
" We stayed at The Inn at Bowman's Hill 2 nights for a getaway.   While eating at Bowman's Tavern (right down the road) we couldn't decide what to choose to eat so we came back the 2nd night!  Food was delicious, live entertainment was great without interfering with conversation.  Making a reservation is strongly suggested.  We will be back! ",5
" What a fun restaurant! We loved the lamb sandwich and calamari appetizer. The love music was so good, we had to have some drinks at the bar after dinner to keep listening. ",5
" Bowman's has improved so much.  I enjoy lunches and dinners here.  The wait staff are pleasant and helpful.  The food is good casual fare.  The wednesday night prime rib was prepared as requested, very good and the sides were excellent--the best value ! ",4
 This is one of our favorite 'go to' places.  We have introduced Bowman's to many friends and relatives and now it is one of their favorites.  WELLDONE!!! ,5
 Simply fantastic. The live music was fabulous and our wait staff was attentive. Highly recommend this awesome gem in the woods! ,5
" Good food, relaxed atmosphere.  Stop in for a meal while out and about. ",3
" Bowman's Tavern is worth the drive as the food is delicious, the service is always good and the ambiance is great.  This is one of my favorite restaurants and I especially enjoy the filet. ",5
 Seems every time we go it just keeps getting better and better. Service is attentive! Sandwich or full meal fare always good with nice variable choices. Meatloaf dinner very good!! Valet parking but works well. ,5
 Everything great but wish I hadn't been in the farthest corner where you couldn't hear the piano at all. Will ask for specific seating next time👍. ,5
 Another excellent meal. Love the buffalo wings as usual. The prime rib was perfectly seasoned and cocked. Very good service from Jessica. ,5
" The waiter was very pleasant and in tuned to all our needs. He did an outstanding job. We will be back again, count on it. ",5
" S&amp;W is an excellent steakhouse serving prime, aged beef. The dry aged strips are great, as are the wet aged filets. Sides are generous and served family style for sharing. Yes, it is a bit too expensive to eat at everyday, but for special occasions I don’t know that you could do any better. ",5
" This is the typical, average, non-distinguishable, middle of the road Houston based seafood restaurant.  Don't waste your time or money. ",1
 Great service. Awesome food. And the noise wasn’t so loud that you had to shout. We loved it. Will definitely be back. Encourage people to give it a try over some of the other “louder” steak places. ,5
" My first visit, the food was good and the service was outstanding ",5
 Food was excellent. New server was slow as hell. Had to ask for refills. He was busy playing in the back. Disappeared for long periods repeatedly. ,5
" First visit for my wife and I . BEAUTIFUL place. Meal (brunch) was simply marvelous!! Excellent customer service. It's very pricey, but delicious food, nonetheless. Beautiful view from upstairs. Will definitely visit again. ",5
 Everything was wonderful ,5
" New Years celebration dinner . Food was really good and service was great. Nice view of highland village . Only complaint was the angry shrimp appetizer . 23 dollars for three shrimp . Oh well, everything else was fine . ",4
" I was not able to eat there since there was no one there to greet us and to sit us down. After chasing a server, he sat us and gave us some menus. We waited there for at least 10!minutes until we decided to leave. No one said anything as we walked out. Amazing that in a place like S&amp;W, this thing happens ",1
 Espectacular !!! ,5
" It had loads of potential, but for the price and considering it was New Year’s Eve they really dropped the ball. Reservations were not organized then it just became a ripple effect. The servers are not very disciplined and there are better Steakhouse options in the city. ",3
" While we had a wonderful time, the place and people are amazing, we were not quite ready for the pricing.  We did manage to pay the bill but WOW, quite pricey.  Wonderful, wonderful place for anyone with extra money.  Had a great time! ",5
" From the moment we arrived it felt like something was off. The hostess was only slightly friendly and ordered us upstairs instead of showing us the way. Our server (we only had one, which seems like a waste because there were only 3-4 tables there and it seemed like a strict rule that none of the other servers were allowed to touch any other table) was absolutely awful. He was never around it we only had our water glasses filled once... at the end. Steak was good, the brussel sprouts side had vinegar in it and was not what I expected from the menu description, and the foie gras appetizer was soaked in so much sauce you couldn’t taste the foie gras. When we got our check, the waiter did not take off the filet that I had order but they were all out of (a $60 mistake mind you) and when we tried to mention it he said “oh I forgot to take the filet off” before we even said anything. Hmmmmmm. I understand an “old-fashioned steakhouse experience” but there is no excuse for stains on the walls, bubbling wall paper, dusty fixtures, and non-existent service at a place that costs at least $100 per person.  It definitely seems like training/management issues are at the heart of the problems with the restaurant. ",2
" El servicio muy lento,la comida excelente ",4
 Richard was our server and he was great! Was very aware that my party was there on business and gave us plenty of space and time! The food is always excellent! ,5
 Steak had way too much seasoning on it. Tried to scrap it off! Ruined the dinner. ,3
" We had a 3:00 reservation, so when it came time to order desert we were very disappointed that they had already ran out of 3 of their dessert items. ",4
" We went to the Houston location for Christmas lunch at 2pm. The experience started off bad, had to wait for 20+ on our reservation, once seated we waited another 10+ minutes and then I had to ask the hostess to let the wait staff that we were seated, finally had our drink order taken. Received our drinks and some bread and waited some more, flagged down the waitress and ordered our meal with some starters. We were served the soups &amp; salad which were good, so thing were looking up but once the entrees were served, the disappointment returned.  My Signature Filet was very tough although I ordered it med rare, and my wife's Salmon was not cooked evenly and only the edge were cooked thoroughly.  I would normally bring to the attention of mgmt but since it was Christmas, my wife didn't want to say anything , after dessert, we paid our bill and left.    I normally would not complain on a public forum like this site but since I emailed Smith &amp; Wollensky already with no response, I felt that it was appropriate. It was an approximately $300 meal so I would expect at least an acknowledgement of my email.   FOLLOW UP - the General Manager did contact me last night (1/4/18) via email and is handling the situation. ",2
 Great food in a cool setting but very loud ,4
" Gumbo was great, the etouffee was average but the mesquite grilled halibut was amazing.   The desserts were also done well. ",5
 Waitress was overwhelmed with a busy Saturday night. Food always exceptional! Requested silverware twice and brought wine glasses instead of the bottle we ordered. ,4
" It was a choice and enjoyable evening with another couple.  Good experience, good friends, good food. ",5
" Charged over $70 for 4 Absolute Vodka Tonic.  Charged $15 for a crab claw addition to a shrimp type cocktail. The claw was suppose to weigh 6 ounces.  It actually was about 1.5 ounces, maybe one full bite. My wife ordered some shrimp with bacon. The waitress forgot to order it from the kitchen. It arrived after everyone was done eating. Very bad experience. ",2
 It's a nice place to eat and food is delicious but even though we had made a reservation we had to wait quite a while because it was packed ,2
" good food, attentive staff. Di not have any tonic water on a saturday night for a drink ",4
 The food was ok but not great. Service was not good. The waiter was constantly in a hurry and not attentive. ,3
 Excellent food -service not quite as good as usual ,4
 $40/person for the simpler of the lunch entrees  we ordered is a little pricey and a little noisey for carrying conversations but otherwise top notch restaurant in every way. ,4
 My friend and I always meet here to celebrate our birthdays.  We arrived early for our table which we had reserved by the window but were given one in the middle of the room. It was so loud and noisy we had to scream at each other the whole time. When we left we complained to the hostess and manager who only stated that they can’t accommodate every request. No apology or saying they wish we had a better experience. We won’t be returning there. ,3
 The atmosphere was great and service even better. Food was nicely prepared and delicious; the waiter was attentive and friendly too. ,5
 Food very good &amp; excellent waiter ,5
" Service was on point, but food was just average.  Prices don’t align with food quality. ",3
 Went at lunch. They were training a lot of Waiters.I felt the level of service was not up to par with our previous experiences there ,4
 My wife and I love Goode Company Seafood and have been eating here for years.  You can’t go wrong with a cup or bowl of their gumbo paired with a Campechana seafood cocktail of shrimp and crabmeat.  I have never had a bad meal or bad experience at any of the Goode Company restaurants. ,5
" Went to dinner with friends. Service was slow. Food was great. I would come back again. I think our server was a little frazzled but she was really nice and professional, just slow service. ",3
 Goode Company Seafood is a great Houston establishment.  The menu is varied and offers anything you could possibly want to eat. Ambiance is wonderful! Service excellent and the food for the price can’t be beat. ,5
 Great food! Well worth a reservation to jump the walk in line! ,5
 This restaurant never disappoints.   Specials are always excellent ,5
 We went for my birthday and the server made us feel right at home. Received such great customer service and the food was delicious. ,5
" If you like seafood, you should enjoy this spot.  Even though Sunday night is usually ""quiet"" - busy but quiet, since it was New Years Eve and not a ""set - you have this much time"",  it was packed to the rafters!  Nevertheless, our waiter Sean made sure our drinks and appetizers were promptly delivered and our meal was hot and very well prepared - as always! ",4
 We had reservations. The place had a nice comfortable atmosphere. Food was good and service ok. ,4
 Food was very good. Waitress was too dodgy for my liking. Ambiance was good but it was a bit noisy. I considered it overall good value for money. If I were the manager I would make a few tweaks. ,4
 Food and service were excellent and made me very happy for my birthday celebration there. ,5
 The Campechana is the best in town and the fresh oysters cannot be beat.  Best Seafood in Houston. ,5
" Excellent dinner for our annual gift exchange on Christmas Eve.  Food was great.  The restaurant was hoping, even Santa and Mrs. Claus had dinner there before he started his deliveries! ",5
 Food was good but not great and rather slow service. ,4
 Met friends for a meal.  Had the fried shrimp and sea bass special.  Both entrees were excellent.  Our friends had fried shrimp and the redfish special.  They enjoyed theirs as well.   This restaurant consistently serves great food and service is always top notch. ,5
 We celebrated a gettogether with friends. I ordered the campuchana extra and chocolate cake. We have been to this location before. As always the food was absolutely delicious. I recommend Goode co. Seafood to everybody who loves seafood.  George who seed us was very good. ,5
 Food and service was very good. We will go back. Good place. ,5
" My guest &amp; I took today's special &amp; it was good. Last night it was nosy, but I believe that guests enjoyed foods &amp; the atmosphere. ",4
 Enjoyed the waiter and his recommendations like the seafood gumbo with garlic bead.  Client had the salmon salad and I had the shrimp and oyster combo meal. The veg was string beans with tomatoes that was great.  Only compliant is the place was very noisy even with carpet.  Don’t understand why. ,5
" We always enjoy the food, and have a great time here, the sevices is great and you can have a good time, with your date or friends, husband and I love to go but also my co-workers and I love it for lunch. ",5
 I have eaten here several times.  The food is delicious.  I love the fried catfish and the appetizers are amazing. ,5
" We had an excellent experience on Monday night.  It was our first time to this restaurant for our family.  We went for my brother's birthday dinner.  The food was excellent.  I had one of the featured specials -  grilled snapper topped with avocado, shrimp and tomatoes.  It was the best snapper I have had lately (including Eddie V's a few months ago).  My niece and nephew had the filet with crab meat, and they finished their plates.   My brother had the stuffed flounder and my dad had the sea bass....both were excellent.  Our server, Elvis, was extremely attentive and made sure we had water at all times.  He was very knowledgeable of the menu.  He was extremely accommodating and let us know if we did not like something for some reason to let him know and he would replace it.  We will definitely be adding Goode Company Seafood Katy frwy to our list of restaurants for family birthday dinners in the future! ",5
 We have been Goode Co Seafood customers for many many years.  It is one of our favorite restaurants.  Last nite my mesquite catfish was off.  Fish when cooked is very tender and flaky however last nite half of mine was very rigid and tough like eating a steak rather than fish.  Except for our empanadas all of our food was almost room temperature.  There happened to be an enormous group event there and as we were sitting nearby could see all of the service and kitchen working to get everting served to the group to this massive group.  This may have had something to do with our unusual “off” experience.  Still I expect more from GCS. ,2
 Great food !! A bit noisy and staff was lagging a bit.  Go there and wonder why you haven’t been there before! ,5
 Service Slow Food Cold after waiting over an hour ,3
" Not good at all. Table was dirty had to clean it off. Wine glass had a finger print on it. Servers kept putting dirty dish cart next to my table. I had to remind  my waitress to bring my drinks. I will not eat there again. I spent $250 on the meal.   Waitress was very nice, just a little distracted. ",2
" I made this Christmas Day lunchtime reservation months in advance. I called at the time to insure they would indeed be open, and to ask about what they would be serving. A long-term employee described how it would be the usual turkey &amp; dressing ""traditional meal"" they always serve for Christmas lunch &amp; dinner (""It's very popular"").  A few weeks before the date, I checked their website and it stated ""We'll be serving from our Winter menu."" So I called to ask about the apparent switcheroo, and they apologized and said they would be serving their usual lunch menu. I got the same information when they called a day prior to confirm the reservation.  I was floored to find out upon arrival that the menu would be their *dinner* menu for 1PM lunch. A menu that is much more expensive than their lunch menu (for the same items), but sans the lighter fare. So much for sending the group a lunch menu pdf so they could have their entrees already in mind.  Six of us had lunch, and we were placed in an overflow room, not the main room (no biggie, but hey I made the reservation months in advance). Slow service; mistakes on the order; criminally expensive $9.00 sides (for asparagus?!). Even though two out of six of us ordered soup and appetizer for the meal (and only a few glasses of prosecco), the bill ended up over $500. I paid much less than that for a stellar Thomas Keller meal at Napa's Ad Hoc for our recent Thanksgiving meal.  And is it just me, or is it strange to have an all-African-American older male wait staff wearing white jackets and bow ties? It bristles of a throw-back to the 1950s.  Needless to say, I can't recommend the place and won't be going back. ",1
 Great management. Somehow our order got “lost” in the kitchen. They “comped” our entire bill! Eay to take care of customers. ,5
 Everything was wonderful as usual! ,5
" Excellent service, food was incredible, great choice of delicious steaks. Lobster Mac &amp; Cheese was incredible! ",5
 El mesero olía a alcohol y la carne estaba quemada ,1
" The food and service here is amazing, the upstairs view was amazing especially with the Christmas lights. Highly recommend this. ",5
" Food was great, service was okay.  There was an awful smell outside - smelled like a cat had taken up residence outside the restaurant and marked their territory several times over. ",3
" All food was over salted, ",1
" Great Service, the restaurant manager / maitre d ensured we were happy with our selections as well as attended too. The Cajun bone in ribeye was great, the split pea soup and lardons were delicious / comforting, fitting for a cold rainy day. ",4
 Family pre christmas ,5
" This was the only steak restaurant where we were able to get a reservation at the last minute. Now we know why. Practically empty dining room on second floor, the worst service we've ever experienced in any Houston restaurant. Food served lukewarm after waiting 1-1/2 hour for it. Oyster plate whisked away before last oyster eaten. Porterhouse steak had to be sent back because it was cold (after the long wait), crab cake was barely warm. Server was MIA the entire night, as was management until the last minute. Two salads, soup, and crab cake were comped, but we paid for the $117 porterhouse and our alcoholic beverages. Would've gladly paid for everything to have it served in a reasonable amount of time and hot. We will never go back. ",1
 We frequently pass by this S&amp;W and finally decided to give it a try on my wife's birthday. There are a lot of extremely nice restaurants in this area of Houston--and S&amp;W compares very favorably with all of them. On the night we ate there the restaurant was not too busy. We were seated in a booth with a window on the second floor. Our server was extremely professional. We each ordered a Manhattan--they were better than the ones I make (and I'm pretty proud of my Manhattans). I had a perfectly prepared 10 oz fillet. My wife had the tuna which was equally good. We enjoyed the evening there very much and recommend S&amp;W. ,5
" The experience was horrible. We were celebrating a birthday and the evening was ruined because of the lack of attentiveness. The waiter had too many tables so every time we needed something we had to flag someone down. We asked for the manager, he came by and kindly gave him the honest feedback to which he replied “this is a busy time of year for us and we have some people out sick and are understaffed”. No apology, no offers to do anything to make it better and never returned to see how things were. Horrible horrible service and will not return. ",2
" I hadn't been to Smith &amp; Wollensky for quite some time and was so impressed with the entire evening of great food, wonderful service and such a terrific view sitting upstairs. Will definitely be back again soon. Steaks were definitely cooked to perfection! ",5
" S &amp; W has great steaks and salads, but otherwise, total failure.  We ordered a side of mushrooms, that were cut too large and were so rubbery, even our waiter (rarely seen waiter) stated he hears that a lot.  Due to the rare visits by our waiter, we got a supervisor/manager to fix our side order of mushrooms, which he promised to rush out.  He “rushed” then out, but we had finished dining 5 minutes earlier.  The service was friendly, but embarrassingly bad.  From the early “forgetfulness” to bring our wine, to the mushroom travesty, the service just sucked.  Gotta say, the steaks were great, but for $55, I expect a good experience dining, as well as a tasty steak.  Lots of places to get a great steak in this town (for that price!), and we’ll be visiting them, and NOT S &amp; W soon. ",3
" We were there for my daughter's birthday dinner. There was no acknowledgment that it was her birthday at all. While the waiter was attentive, since we've been to a couple of other steak restaurants recently, we were able to compare the difference with the other steak restaurants immediately. In 2 other restaurants, every time someone left the table, a waiter would refold the napkin to place back on the table. At S&amp;W, the waiter merely move the napkin to the side while he brushed off crumbs at the table.   We ordered some appetizers - The beef bacon was divine, the foie gras was... boring and bland. 2 of our 6 steaks were over salted and one was so bad, that my daughter took two bites and ad to stop. Of the 4 sides we ordered, the truffle mac and cheese was the best. It was scrumptious and flavorful. Our other sides of mash potatoes, asparagus and cream spinach were fair. Nothing to write home about. Overall, a little disappointed with our experience. ",3
 Had Thanksgiving dinner and it was very disappointing. I’ve eaten at S&amp;W before and always had a great experience but this was not. Service was very slow. Had to ask for status a couple times. Waiter sat a glass of water on the crack between two tables pushed together and spilled a glass of waters. We had to change tables. We were seated in the runway for serving staff. Had a cart they were putting dirty dishes on sitting right next to our table. Really???  Pay $400 for dinner and stair at a cart of dirty dishes half the time.  Not good. ,2
 Thanksgiving ,5
" We went for Thanksgiving dinner - the food was very good, the service was impeccable - they did not rush us at all, it wasn't noisy - we could easily hear each other talk. We were always impressed with the bar service - great, friendly bartenders, and we're now also impressed with their table service. This is a neighborhood fav. ",5
" We recently went to Smith and Wollensky for a Sunday lunch in the bar/patio due to the great weather.  This place may not be as trendy as the other steak places, but they never disappoint.  The food and service was excellent.  We decided to try some different items this time, and all were spot on- beef bacon, steak tartare, and angry shrimp.  Of course, the waitstaff are always impeccably mannered.   If you haven't been, the more casual seating in the bar/patio area is perfect for weekend bites. ",5
 I thought the bartender was excellent.  I didn't care for the food at all.  My steak wasn't cook to the correct temperature that i like. The bread pudding was extremely dry and the atmosphere wasn't that great.  I won't eve return. ,2
" The restaurant was very nice and calm to talk with friends and enjoying the meals. Very good Thai tastes and good services, I really enjoy there. ",5
 Excellent food and tremendous ambiance. The food was perfectly cooked and the temperature was according to the request. Great service start to finish . Best Thai place I’ve been to in Houston. ,5
 Excelent food and service ,5
 This restaurant has the best Thai food that I've had in Houston. The service is excellent and so is the food. ,5
 Excellent pad thai. Lunch special includes soup and salad.  All for $11. ,5
" The restaurant was lovely, quiet, and the food was absolutely delicious. I cannot eat very spicy food, and the staff tailored our meal to that. The waitress told us what items weren’t spicy at all, &amp; made all the other items with a minimal amount of peppers.  The restaurant  looks upscale. However, the prices were within reason. ",5
" Food is amazing - spicy eggplant, beef coconut curry, and pad si eww beef noodles were delicious and I highly recommend!!! Service was good also! Our only complaint is that it was Extremely loud - prefer a quieter less painfully loud ambience. ",4
" Our  server continue to rush us if we were finish !!! I was having lunch with my Classmate from 1 grade. I’m 53 ,,,, we were talking and trying to ketch up... we would have order more!!! Please don’t do that  Happy New Year ",1
 Great food and ambience. Reservations were quick and easy. ,5
" Excellent, as usual. Very high standard of service and cuisine ",5
" The food was superb, the spices were delicious and overall we had a great time ",5
 We love this restaurant.  The food is always wonderful. ,5
" I've been to Songkran for lunch many times, but had never been for dinner. We went late on a Sunday night and the restaurant was less than half full. We hoped to get great, quick service and be on our way. Service was incredibly slow all on fronts and not terribly friendly. I may return for lunch, but am not putting it on the short list for dinners. ",3
" Food was delicious as always. Service was friendly and relatively fast.  Good experience, great ambiance.  Don't like that we could smell cigarette smoke on the patio. ",4
 This is one of my favorite restaurants. It's not large so have a reservation if you can. The staff is very good with recommendations per your taste prefernces. The red curry duck and the short ribs will have you slap your mama! ,5
 Food is always outstanding.  Service is well meant  but it is hit or miss ,4
 This restaurant is in decline. The service was atrocious notwithstanding no one was in the restaurant. No service utinsils or plates and extra bowls. The server lost my credit card somewhere on the floor. We've come here for the last three years and the last few trips have been similarly uninspiring. Hope things improve. We won't return anytime soon ,2
 I really like their cuisine and have returned about 6 times. I like to introduce this centrally located restaurant. Now that the weather is cooler I like to to sit on the patio. There are fans too!! ,5
 We each had a soup. Husband a curry and I the pad thai. Recommend the restaurant for the food and the friendly staff. Acts like a neighborhood restaurant ,5
 The Restaurant weeks menu is wonderful.  I recommend the chicken wings for appetizer.  They were delicious. ,4
" This restaurant is one of the loudest places I have been in years. The tables at long rectangles, yet the cuisine is Thai and served family style. When have I ever had a $100 per person Thai dinner? And did I mention loud? The food was OK, but not really memorable. ",3
 I will be back. ,5
 Birthday celebration ,4
" Thank you  for making my sister's visit from LA, California a great dining experience. The food was delicious and the Lynchee Martinis were so good. The service was outstanding as well. ",5
" On our recent visit we were particularly impressed with how beautiful the space is. The bar and decor are outstanding, which contribute to an intimate atmosphere. There is a small but nice outdoor patio which would be nice during more temperate months. The food was quite good, in particular the ""Heavenly Beef"" and the duck curry main. Veggie spring rolls were tasty, well executed and hot. The Pad Thai was good, but not outstanding. Service was attentive though a few tweaks would make it outstanding.  The drink and wine menu is good; from what we saw the Happy Hour menu would be quite a deal.  We will be back. ",4
 Dinner &amp; service were excellent. Wagu spare rib &amp; the Duck Noodle soup were delicious! ,5
 Salad greens were not fresh. Asked for less spicey dish but was same as friends who asked for more spice. ,3
 We have been to Songkran many times and the food and service are reliably good. ,4
" Overall food was very good, tasty and well prepared, but calamari appetizer was of the big tentacles which were rubbery and lobster &amp; shrimp curry had very little lobster. ",4
 It is located in a very nice area of town.  Staff always pleasant and the food is good. . ,4
" The lunch special was a great value and included a delicious soup, nice salad and excellent entrée with rice. ",4
" Food and Service we're impeccable!!  Amazing experience, one of best in Houston in my opinion. ",5
 Great food nice place ,5
 First time dining here and it was awesome. I will definitely return. Great food and service. ,5
" We were able to sit outside on a very nice covered patio. Service was very good.  The only major disappointment was the crab fried rice, boring bland. My husbands only joy at any Asian restaurant is fried rice. ",4
 Excellent Food. One of my favorite Thai restaurants in Houston. Great value for lunch. ,5
 Highly recommend this restaurant. We shared the deep fried fish - it was excellent. We were able to select our level of spice - level one was perfect for us. Presentation was outstanding! Service friendly and efficient. Prices reasonable. ,5
 Good food and the service was very good and most attentive ,4
" Mentioned on my reservation that we are Vegan and celebrating our anniversary.  they presented us with a vegetarian/vegan menu upon arrival and said Happy Anniversary to us as we departed.  What a delicious meal, great service, and lovely experience! ",5
" I wanted to love this Thai restaurant, my wife and I liked it, but I have to admit I would probably try another Thai or Chinese restaurant before I returned to Songkrat. I did enjoy the patio we were seated at, very quiet with some greenery and soft background music. Nothing bad here, just lacked an extra gear in the food department vs a more plebian suburban Thai restaurant. I guess I expected something that didn't seem to be present in the food department last Saturday night. ",3
" Loved the food, the atmosphere, the overall look! I had a great time and have already recommended the place to my friends! ",4
" I go to Nectar more than any other restaurant, and always have a good experience there. ",5
" This is a great restaurant, food is really great as the service. However it can really noisy from time to time. If there would be something done there, it would an absolutely amaizing restaurant ",3
" I took a friend to Nectar on Mother’s Day and it was a wonderful experience. The service was impeccable, the atmosphere warm yet modern and the food was fantastic. Our server was not only extremely polite but very knowledgeable about the food and beverage selection, she made some delicious recommendations. For an appetizer we had a hot dish and we also had something from the sushi bar, the pork dumplings with the pear duck sauce was the perfect mix of sweet and savory, and the eel roll topped with a spicy crab salad was refreshing and clean. One thing that I really appreciated was the attention to detail the wasabi and ginger on the sushi plate were so fresh, it was a joy. All of the main entries were not only beautifully plated but delicio ",5
 The mushroom soup was outstanding. The service was extremely fast and everyone courteous. It was a true taste experience. ,4
 Worst service ever. I had to send all our food back (1st time in my 40+ years). It ended with my daughter crying and hungry - she felt she messed up mother's day by taking me there. When I went to the bar tender and asked to see the manager she asked me who my waiter was -after being there an hour was I didn't even know - I had stopped multiple people going by to try and fix stuff. When we left manager kept asking me if I wanted to take the rolls with me when we were leaving(I couldn't get bill before that) she didn't get that was supposed to be my daughter's entree and that they wouldn't keep in a car for hours. I did pay for the rolls just to get my daughter out of there. ,1
 great food and service as usual! ,4
 Restaurant was really good. Creative asian cuisine. Love Open Table. Makes things very easy. ,4
 Food is always very good here as is the service. Drinks are also a stand-out. For the first time we sat out on the terrace - the noise from the road is a little distracting but it is much quieter out there than in the restaurant. The dim sum is always terrific and the butter poached lobster pad thai - YUM! The donuts with three sauces for dessert is not to be missed no matter how full you are and comes proportioned to share. ,4
 Wonderful food &amp; great service! ,5
 The food and service was excellent. The noise level was just too lound for a pleasant meal. ,4
 Food was excellent. i requested a quiet table and my request was honored. we had a very nice corner table. would highly recommend. ,4
" This is one of the best places on the Main Line.  I had my Dad's 80th birthday party there and it was wonderful.  We've been there for several dinners, all good, and for brunch, not so good.  The place is gorgeous and spacious and the servers are great.  Give it a try! ",5
 Great food and wonderful service. Nice outdoor patio but seating was a bit cramped outside(placement of heat lamps). Nice atmosphere and overall great experience. You should expect that since you're paying for it. ,4
 The place was rocking and had a very lively bar area. We selected outdoor seating which was great on this beautiful Saturday evening. Service outside was excellent. Food was excellent. I enjoyed my fresh calamari salad and WOK soft shell crab. ,4
 The food was outstanding and the service was impeccable! ,5
" NECTAR is a nice place, too noisy for my taste. I enjoyed the tuna tartare and the goat cheese salad. The rolls were ok, unimpressive. The creme brulee was perfect. Excellent wine, efficient and courteous service, including the valet. More a place for business than for gastronomy. ",3
" What a wonderful location for a special-occasion dinner. The decor is exceptional. Our server, Bob, was attentive, and very willingly repeated things my guests didn't initially hear or understand. He recommended specials which we enjoyed. We started with a delicious mushroom soup with goat-cheese crouton. We shared a bento appetizer. Our entrees came quickly after they were ordered, but there was never a feeling of being rushed. The portion sizes are perfect, and the presentation was exquisite. We decided to share a second glass of wine, and Bob had it 'split' at the bar for us. A special anniversary dessert was prepared and served with enjoyment which really made my guests feel 'celebrated.' The evening was perfect in every way. ",5
" Great food, great service (Bob was the best), great drinks, great time! Can't wait to go back to our favorite Saturday night out spot. ",5
" Food was good, service was excellent but the noise level was overwhelming. ",4
" Good food, great ambiance, good service. This is still ",4
 Not too dark or too light. Great atmosphere for conversation. ,5
" Wonderful food and decor, except for the stained upholstery, looks like someone is not paying attention to the details. ",4
" Always consistently great!! Food is fantastic, service is outstanding and the atmosphere is fun! ",4
" Our reservation was for 7:45 and we arived early and they sat us right away. Sake and sushi was very good. Tables were nice and seats were comfortable. I have to say that the service from our waiter made it a perfect dinner, two thumbs up for Nectar. ",5
" we went @ 5:15 on a Monday- not crowded or noisy. Entrees were pricey, good but not stellar, and not oversized. ",4
" The drinks never fail at Nectar—Martinis: Mango Ginger, Pomegranate Blueberry, Blood Orange, and more—and they serve to perfectly prepare your palate for what's to come. For starters, my wife and I shared the dim sum for two (I'd also recommend you not miss the wild mushroom soup with panko-crusted goat cheese). Our entree consisted of a selection of Nectar-created sushi rolls, my favorite of which was the spicy tuna, cucumber, avocado, roe roll. While the scene at Nectar is always buzzing with action, a quiet romantic dinner can be a challenge. Even though I am young, I found it very difficult to hear over the noise (we sat in the upper section overlooking the bar). If you're looking for good conversation, consider a weeknight visit. ",4
" Great food, great service. I can't believe I waited so long to go here. ",5
" love, love, love this place. we go here for pretty much every special occassion. ",5
 A little quieter than usual. Not having to strain to have a conversation made it an enjoyable evening. ,5
 The best restaurant in our area and surrounding areas....our favorite. We go every week and everything remains the same - P E R F E C T!! ,5
" This is a beautiful, upscale restaurant that I've visited a half dozen times. It's a fun place to come with friends and the food is good. I have to say though, the sushi at Shangrila in Devon is cheaper and better. The decor is not as nice there but the food makes up for it. ",4
 Great dinner- great to celebrate with friends and family. Every dish we've had here has been spectacular! ,5
" Food is very good but place is very noisy. We have been to Nectar a couple times before. Although it is a bit pricy, we liked the place. This time we went for a nice anniversary dinner where we knoew the food would be good and we could talk. We were seated downstairs in a row along the wall next to some very noisy teenage girls OMIGOD!! We asked to be moved to a quieter table and they immediately moved us to a table by itself at the top of a stairway in a hallway. Yes, it was quiet but we had waitstaff running by and it was right by the office door. Finally, we were moved to an upstairs table in a regular room. The food was very good (sea bass with wild mushrooms)but the place was not easy to have a conversation due to the noise. ",4
" Consistant, fantastic food, great service and the decor is fabulous. I call it Budakan West which is a high compliment! ",5
 Fabulous tastes with so many new delicious flavors. Every item ordered was presented so beautifully and with purpose. A wonderful experience! ,5
 Menu has alot of great choices.  App/Entree/Desert were all exceptional.  Service was great. ,5
" The sushi was good, but overpriced. The filet mignon came out overcooked, in two pieces, and was also not the right cut of meat; it was actually two thin slices of overcooked sirloin. The environment itself was ridiculously loud, we were shouting and leaning forward for most of the meal. The duck was excellent and the service was flawless, but the price was way too high. ",2
" Nectar has been able to maintain as well as improve upon it's initial wonderful food quality and creativity. They seem serious about making their food, their ambiance and their service something to experience. They have successfully created a warm and exciting atmosphere that brings the city in to the suburbs. In addition to the food and great vibe, the mango martini alone is worth the trip. My only criticism is the high price of the a la carte sushi. I would love to see them adjust their prices and increase their sushi offerings. ",5
" The atmosphere was great--beautiful, modern interior with relaxing/zen lighting. Nice spot for a date or to get that downtown feeling. However, with the lofty prices, I felt that we should have been wowed by the food, and that was not the case. Everything was good, but not exceptional. My husband's tempura shrimp was listed as ""spicy"" on the menu, and it was not very spicy at all &amp; it lacked seasoning. He was also supposed to have asparagus with his meal and he had only ONE piece of tempura asparagus, which was very suprising for a place like this. My spring special, the butter lobster pad thai was very good and seasoned well, but the lobster was a little chewy, which really disappointed me. The service was exceptional &amp; nice wine list. ",3
 Really enjoyed the food and the happy hour prices. Great waitress. Would go there again. ,4
 We were expecting a four star restaurant and were very disappointed that we had such a bad experience! ,1
 Great meal at a good price. Great service ,5
" We had a great time, the staff was very attentive to our needs. I was celebrating my birthday. We will definitely return for more dining opportunities. ",5
 For a seafood place not to serve lobster is a little odd and they leaned heavily on the fried side. Food was well prepared hot and tasty. Good environment for the kids! Appetizers definitely hit the spot for starteers. ,4
 Best seafood in Houston for sure.   It is VERY LOUD.  Great attention to detail. ,5
" It was my Partners Birthday.  The main appetizer was the Campechana, it was AMAZING as usual.  My Partner ordered the 6 Oysters for $16.00.  I ordered the crab cakes, I ended up sending them back. They just didn't taste good.  So I ended up getting the Shrimp Gumbo, which was AMAZING as well. I'm glad I ended with that.   Our server was Dali and he was very understanding and worked with me to make this dinner was just right. ",5
" Amazing hospitality, great food and courteous staff. ",5
" Was easily able to book! Been here many times but never booked via OpenTable.   As business meeting went late, had to move the booking to 6.15pm instead of 5.30pm and was able to do so with the hostess when I called with very little fuss. Thank you! Would definitely recommend!  (tell Alex at the bar hi!) ",5
" enjoyed the food. especially the seafood empanada, ",5
" We were very pleased with the superb food quality, variety and level of service at Goode &amp; Co.  I lived in Houston all my life and had NEVER eaten at Goode &amp; Co.  At a friends suggestion and because it was a midpoint for us to meet our friends gathered there for dinner in January.  Our server (sorry I can't remember his name but he was a handsome young man with dark hair and beard) was the BEST I have experienced in quite a while.  He took the time to explain in detail the differences in all of the specials and helped in our selections.   He was expressive, entertaining and you could tell he enjoyed his work!    I would not recommend the restaurant for a quiet ""intimate"" setting because of the noise factor, but would highly recommend for a superbly delicious seafood meal with impeccable service - it can't be beat so says me and the friends who joined us for a great evening. ",5
 Takes forever to get a cocktail! Food always great! ,4
 Enjoyed our dinner.  Service great - server Fidel.  Fried shrimp is the best. ,5
 Great service and teamwork amongst the waitstaff. Consistently serves good food. ,5
" The last time we came here it was elegant and classy. Not so on New Years Eve. We had reservations and they put us in this back room that was hot, bright and noisy. Our salad with pecans did not have them. We asked &amp; were told they dont go by the menu here. Had to ask for more bread&amp;water. Not asked if all was well. More like Red Lobster than 75.00 meal.  waitress rushed and seemed to not really care about us. Very disappointed. We wont be back. A shame! ",1
" Great food...as always. This is truly one of our favorite restaurants.  The seafood Tamales are excellent..the crab cakes are superb.  Whatever your preference, you cannot go wrong here. ",4
" The food here is always good and reasonably priced. My husband had the market catch yellowtail tuna, and I had the red snapper ""San Antonio"" special.  The Texas Bellini is also very good!   Our only complaint is the temperature of the restaurant.  It's always way too cold in there, and we feel like we have to rush through the meal just to warm up. Bring a jacket! ",4
" Very good food and atmosphere! Great service, waitstaff very attentive. ",5
" Although it's one of the nicer seafood restaurants around Houston it is pricey for the portions you get, it's good eating for sure.  Highly recommend the Campechana all the way, it could even be a meal for one. ",4
" We have dined with Goode Seafood since 2013 when we first visited the area. It is always a great experience. That says a lot because just up the road are two other great dining experiences ( unnamed here but easy to figure when you look at addresses).  Goode deliveries on excellent fresh seafood prepared with innovation and creativity. The sauces they present are flavorful and  complement nicely. The wine list is adequate and not over priced. The cocktails we have tried are fresh and well prepared, a little pricey.  The deserts are outstanding. At our table , there was no clear favorite and we had 4 different ones to sample.  The pecan pie though does travel the world, it is special. Goode features evening chef meals thoughtfully put together and varies. We tried both different offerings and they were great and very different from each other. They do up charge on those items significantly from normal menu dinner options and create less value because of that. Plus the wait service does not volunteer that pricing up charge . Goode should address that when verbally presenting. But that is a small correction and does not detrack from a great evening out.  Thank you Goode for your consistent high quality experience. ",5
 It was good as always!!! The Campechana is a must!! ,4
 Had the shrimp/crab ceviche for an appetizer - this was really good. Almost like a salsa version of a ceviche. I had the shrimp gumbo for dinner and that was excellent. ,5
 Lunch at Goode Co. Seafood has become  a day after Christmas tradition in our family. ,5
" Good food, good service ",5
 Had a Friends Christmas Dinner this year here.  We always come for the oysters and the Campechana DE Mariscos-Seafood.  The service is always great here ,5
 Goode Co. Seafood - Katy Freeway is one of my favorite places to eat - even though I am not a seafood lover.  Their special appetizer is awesome &amp; I love the fried catfish filets. ,5
 Very good food and our waiter was wonderful! ,4
 We enjoyed our meal as always.  The gumbo is the BEST!  My fried shrimp and oysters were great also.  When I'm in the mood for seafood this is the place I choose. ,5
" True it was Christmas time, service was not bad but a little strained due to volume in the restaurant. There was a private party in the middle of the room behind a curtain and they were disruptive to the rest of the guests. My guests enjoyed their food, however I was ill the next day. This is my first time to this restaurant I am not sure I will go back. ",4
 Love this place!  Not as noisy as so many places.  We were there for 2 1/2 hours just eating great food and visiting with friends! ,5
 Very good food but the restaurant was very loud. I was with an elderly couple and they had trouble hearing the waitress and people in our own party b/c the noise was so loud. ,5
" great stop, but too damn expensive, even for medical personnel !! ",3
 Goode Company Seafood is dependably a great place for lunch or dinner. ,4
 As usual we had a very good meal--we each had the mesquite flounder/shrimp and enjoyed our dinner. The service was also good but the main course arrived before we had finished the gumbo---felt a bit rushed. ,4
" We have enjoyed Goode Co. Seafood on the Katy freeway on several occasions.  The food has always been excellent, the dinning room is spacious but warm feeling and the wait staff are very professional. We also appreciate that the noise level is reasonable even on a busy Friday night. It's nice not to have to strain to hear your dinner companions. ",4
 Awesome food. Very fresh and great service but very loud ambience. ,5
 Such amazing flavor on the fresh grilled shrimp. This was the best seafood that I have had since moving to Houston. Can't wait to come back! ,5
 Magnificent food. The Campenchana and Gumbo are fabulous! ,5
 I had 1/2 oyster Sandwich with a cup of crab Gumbo. The best crab Gumbo I have ever tasted and I grew up in Louisiana. ,4
 Are service this time was very poor. Our waiter was not very attentive and messed up on some of the orders. Also did not check on us and our table was not bussed in a timely manner between appetizers and our main course. ,3
" We had a great meal the server was fine a little stand offish some issues with getting his attention. The assistant staff seemed disgruntled and a birthday gift my fiance received seemed to be ""misplace"" when we left and although it was returned  it seemed one of the staff may have tried to take it. ",3
 Enjoyed a Saturday afternoon dinner with wife and daughter.  Food was good and service was great.  We we're seated right away. ,4
" I was so sad when we left this restaurant.  We love the Pappas in Glen Burnie and were so hopeful for this location that is near the Hippodrome theater.   We arrived at six with a few people in the bar.  No one in the restaurant side.  We hear voices in the kitchen but no one came out.  The security guard asked us where we wanted to sit.  A female waitress gave us menus and left.  Then a gentleman took our food order.  Drinks took a while.  We asked for a check since we were on a time schedule.  Received the check it was wrong, waited for new check, while still lots of conversation in the kitchen with no regard to the customers.  The food was good like at other locations.  The service was unforgivable.  We will not be to this restaurant again. ",1
" No one came to our table for 20 minutes. Food order placed but took over an hour for burgers. All items were over cooked, chicken tenders were extremely dry and tasteless and sides were incorrect. No one came back to check on us for over 25 minutes so we could not ask for anything else. Waiter tried to compensate by giving us free drinks but 4 kids at table so no one wanted drinks. Manager eventually came to table and offered 15% off for a horrible experience.  Would not go back. ",1
" Despite some of the poor reviews regarding bad service and cold food my husband and I decided to give it a try as we've eaten at other Pappas' and my husband loves the crab cakes. Service was extremely slow. At least half an hour after we gave our order our food had not arrived. Was it a poorly run kitchen, a neglectful waitress? It wasn't a busy restaurant--there was only two other tables besides ours (one with two people, one with one person). When the food finally did arrive, it was sub-par and cold. The crab cake was good but the side of broccoli was cold. Our salads was small and uninteresting. My hamburger had a piece of lettuce that was rotted and which I removed. Meanwhile, as part of a sports bar, the TVs were blaring and the lights were very bright. A very disappointing evening. Pappas, you need new management/oversight at Inner Harbor! ",2
 Crab cakes were excellent. Burger sliders - awful. ,4
 Very disappointing as we are accustomed to the other Pappas restaurants and this one failed miserably. They originally said we had to eat at the bar because the restaurant was closed even though it opened at 5 but they had no server for the dining room. Then they said it was okay fir the dining room because someone came in. The crab cakes were not good. They had so much old bay they were literally orange inside and they had a lot of filler. The broccoli came out cold and I asked if it had butter on it &amp; she said they put butter in the water when they boiled it. Then she did bring out butter she had melted in the microwave but then it kind of jelled because the broccoli was cold. We asked if they would validate our parking because it cost $20.00 to park but they said no because the Manager was not there and they had no validation tickets to give us. So overall it was a very poor &amp; disappointing experience &amp; one I will never do again &amp; will not recommend the place. ,3
" We were tired after walking all day at a trade show and decided to eat at our hotel (Holiday Inn Inner Harbor).  Not busy at all at 6pm on Thursday.  Crab cake was a nice size and had little filler,  decent taste, but it wasn't very hot.  Potatoes with pesto tasted like they had sat there for a few hours.  Broccoli was fine, but only warm. $20 ",4
 Known for great 99% crab cakes.  Service was excellent. ,4
 Had heard about Pappas legendary crab cakes - they did not  disappoint! ,5
 Just opened. I have dined at several Pappas restaurantS for many years. This one was still working out the kinks. ,3
" The food was absolutely horrible. They charged me $32 for halibut and that was not worth $5. I don't mind paying that amount for good fish at a good restaurant but that was far from it. Go to Eddie V's, go to Trulucks, heck, go to Denny's... anything is better than that hole ",1
" Goode Company Seafood has been one of my favorite restaurants. The atmosphere was nice, service great, and food was excellent. Tuesday night was my first visit in a while. I found it crowded, noisy, and the food only acceptable for the price. The first two points may have distracted from the taste of the food. I doubt I will return. I know I won't be recommending it like I have in the past. There are too many alternatives that I enjoy more. ",3
" My halibut was undercooked and when I pointed it to the waiter, he took it back and the kitchen re-cooked the same piece if fish, now making it rubbery from over cooking. I guess you can't win. ",3
" Goode Co. is one of our go to places for fish. We enjoy the food, service, and atmosphere. We also like the fact that we can usually be seated quickly. They are now starting to take reservations which is really nice. ",5
 Excellent service from greeting to dessert service. Good seating and quiet for good conversation. The grilled fish halibut and snapper as well as the crab cakes were delicious. ,5
 The service was great and the food was good. The waiter was very accommodating when we asked to move tables when a large crowd came in for one table. ,4
 We came down the city to go to the Orioles game. And decided to go to dinner at Pappas. The food was absolutely awesome. From the humongous crabcakes to the huge salad you could share. Everything was delicious. Service was a little slow but the food made up for it. A definite go to before game. Thanks! ,4
" The staff was fantastic (both our waitress and the manager). We were at the Science Center so I suggested to some friends that we were with that we check it out. The problem is that I'm used to the Pappas in Parkville and Cockeysville. I love all the extras you get like the cucumber salad and the bread and you don't get it there.  Also there was salmon on the menu and one friend ordered that. It wasn't even pink and it was way overcooked. When we mentioned it to the manager she offered to give her something else, but she refused, so they sent us home with a carry out crab cake which was great! The rest of us got crab cakes and they were great. ",3
" My onions rings were cold, greasy and soggy, crab cakes were cold and halfway through my dinner, the waitress asked if  I wanted the check, not to mention when the waitress poured water from a pitcher, it spilled on to my foot. ",3
 Disappointed in burger and bun---mediocre. Out-of-town friends seemed happy with splitting a double crab cake platter.  Thrilled that it was quiet enough at dinner to have a pleasant conversation. Server was quite attentive. ,4
 Made reservations to dine 1 1/2 hours before concert. Service was a complete disaster. They turned dinners away. We only got seated cause we had reservations. Finally got our food after an hour wait. Talked to the manager and found out he started 5 days ago at this location and didn't have a full staff assembled as yet. He was delivering the food from the kitchen. The crab cakes were out of this world. I would give this restaurant one more chance based on closeness to the arena and outstanding crab cakes. ,3
 This was the worst experience we have ever had. Our reservation was not in the book. The restaurant had no idea of what was going on. We waited over 20 minutes for our drinks. We never received our food because they did not know which orders went  to which tables. We spoke to the managers twice but nothing was resolved. After one hour we got up and left never receiving our food. ,1
" Very accommodating staff! We had 12 people including a wheel chair. Our waiter Dillon was awesome! The appetizers were good, but small for the price. Would like to try it in the summer time in the back deck. View and setting is beautiful! ",3
" Fast seamless dining service, decent food, beer selection eh, live music on occasion. Great ambiance, fun place. ",4
" The restaurant was so cold, we shivered and barely could eat.   The food was served warm and was cold in a few minutes.  The breeze came right through the windows that weren't insulated. ",2
 Clean the ceiling fans...gross to look around and see dirt over your head and food... ,4
" Simply we saw a mouse on the next table and the food was under the expectations, price higher for the low quality of food. ",2
" Food was great.  Service lacking.  First said they didn't have our reservation which wasn't an issue as there were tables available. Server highly inattentive, did not check on our meal or refill drinks.  For the price of drinks, dinner, and lack of service ... we won't return. ",1
" My son and I like to come here before going to the game. We like sitting outside across from, I can't believe someone said this, the big sail boat. I thought my son was going to fall off his chair.    The Constellation is only one of the coolest things in the Harbor Place. The crab dip is awesome, the crab soup was equally great. We enjoy the atmosphere. ",5
" My dad and I decided to eat here for dinner. We used One Touch reservation and were seated immediately outside. The weather was perfect, we had a great view of the inner harbor. There was live music below us and a nice breeze from the harbor. The food was awesome and the service was great. A wonderful experience. Definitely will go again the next time we're in Baltimore. ",5
 Must try their Irish beer! 👍🏻 ,5
" While I liked the location and motif of the restaurant, the food was reminiscent of a commercial restaurant that is not focused on quality, so much as quantity (of sales).  My fish was okay, albeit salty, but my friend's corned beef reuben was much like rubber.  It ruined our dinner for his birthday and I ended up not eating mine either, as a result.  I would not go back. ",3
" We really enjoyed this place. I had the Irish nachos (potato crisps with beer cheese sauce, Corned Beef and cabbage) and my daughter had the Reuben! Sooooo good! ",5
" Every year following the St. Patrick's 5k, we enjoy lunch at Tir Na Nog.  We love the food, friends, and atmosphere.   It rounds out the whole experience of the day. ",5
" We ate out on an unseasonably warm February day! They were a little overwhelmed and understocked but I can't blame them. The food was hot and delicious and our server was friendly and helpful despite having been there for 12 hours and covering many tables. Lovely view too, we'd go back! ",4
 Spent the day at the inner harbor and topped the day  off at Tri Na Nog . We all enjoyed a delicious meal - Great French fries and good selection of beer! ,4
" Fun setting, cool decor, good food. Looks like it would be a great hangout bar in the summer! ",5
" We were seated near the door on a cold night and it was cold and drafty.  Before we sat we expressed our desire not to be near the door but the receptionist was too busy to focus on anything.  Later, as the chilly wind kept coming in each time the door opened, we asked a manger if they could move us or close the outer doors to no avail.   We were not sure why the staff would not close the outer doors. The service was marginal and the food was average. ",1
 Love the Irish Nachos ,5
" Super busy night but we were well-taken care of. Thanks, TNN! ",5
 My wife and I have been to this restaurant several times now at the Baltimore Harbor and always had great meals. Would definitely suggest the Corn beef and Cabbage (superb). My wife likes their fish N chips and of course the Guiness beer. Excellent service. ,5
 We began with the Irish Nachos which are always a favorite.  The beer on tap selection was good -a nice variety.  My husband had the fish and chips - tasty and not too breaded. My son had the reuben on marbled rye and that was also very good.  The view of the harbor was delightful. And our waitress did a great job. ,4
 The food was just OK and seemed to be priced high for what you got. ,3
" Sunday lunch. Great outdoor dining experience overlooking the Inner Harbor. Irish Nachos and Tuna Tartar were great and plentiful portions. Maryland crab soup was full of crab and veggies, and the salads were great and the small size was plenty big. Crab cake sandwiches and the Reuben were very good. The service was excellent, and we were not rushed and were able to enjoy a beautiful lunch on the deck. A great start to a terrific day. ",5
" In short, the decor was interesting. The atmosphere a little too dark for a spring evening. The food was OK. The server borught our drinks, which for some reason were very wet (The glasses). Water was all over the table. She left and didn't return to dry the tabel, so we did it ourselves. We asked for extra napkins and got a small stack of drink napkins which were not very helpful. We used our dinner napkins to clean and dry the table. Our server performed her duties, but with little enthusiasm. About the same enthusiasm i have about ever returning. It was OK. ",2
 This is a typical tourist joint in a touristy area. Not bad if you need to eat. ,2
" Love love love this place!!  First time.  Beware: Irish nachos are loaded fried potato twists with cheese, corned beef and cabbage.  Delicious!!!  Crab cakes are awesome!!! ",5
" I'm not the biggest Irish Pub fan in the world, and this one doesn't do all that much for me. I'm happy they host charity events, and I find the food to be solidly ok. In fact, the ranch dressing was really pretty good. I wish I'd gotten a salad. Man can only eat so many potatoes. ",3
" Great Shepherd's pie, but exceptionally slow service for a weeknight where restaurant wasn't crowded. This came as no surprise based upon some YELP reviews I had read prior to booking, however. Beautiful view of the harbor. ",3
" The food was just OK.  The service was just OK.  Honestly, there is nothing special about this place except for the outdoor dining.  If I were to come here again, I would go just for drinks on the patio, then go elsewhere for dinner.    Here's another Tir na Nog oddity:  Happy hour is only for patrons seated AT the bar, not IN the bar.  So even if you are sitting at a table in the bar, you can't order happy hour.   That's absurd. ",2
 Great spot for lunch and outdoor dining. The view was perfect and the grilled octopus was great as well as the peach and watermelon salad!! ,4
 REAT SERVICE AND FOOD. HELPED US WITH LARGE PARTY. GREAT SEATS NEAR THE BAR. ,4
" Back in Baltimore for the Army/Navy football game this year, I had visions in my head of my visit in 2007. The lighted-boat parade was the same day as the game, back then, and Tir na Nog was the place to watch from. This year I just went for the second floor ambiance, and the service, and the food. After the game, this place was mobbed. People are waiting over an hour for tables. Dad and I walk in and are seated in minutes. The young fellow working the reservations and waiting list was full of patience. Anna G was our delightful waitress. The kitchen was hopping, as appetizers and entrées flew out to tables. My gosh but the view of the harbor is lovely. In nicer weather you might dine out on the deck. I December the warmth inside is just perfect. Really nice Irish preparations, and other things, too -- I loved my crab soup and my bangers &amp; mash. Dad had the shepherd's pie. A great beer list, of course, and also wine. Darn good desserts -- I had the pumpkin cheesecake and I rarely eat cheesecake. Highly recommended, and thanks for handling a crowd so well! ",4
 My wife and I again had an excellent dinner and drinks this past Saturday night at the Baltimore Harbor's Tir Na Nog. The service and staff was superb. The customer relations was outstanding. you have to try the beef pot pie-- ,5
 Good food with a varied menu consistent with its' Irish roots.  Excellent choices of beer. Wait staff attentive though we had to ask for a better choice of seating given it was a light night and the Host's first choice was away from the harbor view. ,4
" My niece and I had been to the Tir Na Nog in Philly and really enjoyed it.  We met an old friend of mine for the weekend in Baltimore - she is from St Louis and wanted to see the Inner Harbor.  We were greeted nicely, seated immediately, the menu had enough variety for all of us.  We ordered drinks (the house ale is really good), appetizers (try the Wickam Toasties - something really different and we all shared it and wished we had had it to ourselves!!), and all of us enjoyed our meals -- the lamb shank was rich and savory and the meat was fall off the bone good, the salmon was cooked perfectly and the greens and carrots were delightful, the Tir Na Nog burger with pulled pork on top was unusual and tasty. ",4
" This restaurant was good and is what I would expect for the inner harbor.  I much prefer restaurants off the beaten path, but for such a touristy area, I would come back again if I was at the harbor. ",3
" Service was wonderful...our  waiter was awesome...the staff. On the whole where under pressure that weekend, the star spangle weekend, but all were professional, friendly and very helpful. When in Baltimore, will go back to sit on the deck!!!!! ",4
 Great food great service and a great view. This place ia aqesome. ,5
 Good authentic Irish fare and lively bar scene. Wait staff was knowledgable and attentive. View of Harbor was outstanding. ,3
" I'm an Italian, so I may not know my Irish food, but did dine with an irishman who thought the food was good.  We had good service and enjoyed evening very much ",4
 My son loved their signature nog burger but the rest of our food was mediocre at best and the outdoor seating area was not clean I would skip this place and try the new Chipotle by the hard rock.  if you're in the mood for Irish chArm trY The James Joyce on the East Harbor excellent place with great food and fun fun atmosphere. ,2
" The food was very good, plating was appealing and all four of our party enjoyed the meal, except for the bread. The bread was the worst that any of us could recall having at a major restaurant. At least we didn't fill up on the bread before our meal! We ordered drinks, appetizers, a bottle of wine and entrees all around and the service was not up to the level of the food. We had to ask several times for more water and for our table to be cleared. The real downside of the experience was the noise level, it was way too loud. The ladies in our group were sitting side by side and they eventually gave up on trying to talk. A restaurant of this caliber really should invest in some noise dampening ceiling treatments and decor. ",4
 I have been here many times and always have had excellent service and food. I would recomment you start with the Campechana Exra (seafood cocktail) as an appitizer then finish off with a bowl of seafood gumbo. This makes for a great lunch. If you have room they have a great dessert selection.  This is a favorite restaurant of mine. ,4
 The food was exceptional and the atmosphere was good. A little to loud to have an intimate conversation. Had a very good experience. ,5
 My wife and I enjoyed a nice long lunch with friends. The server was very helpful and kind during the entire meal. We had a nice leisurely pace of the meal and even enjoyed some of the desert. We would definitely go back again. ,4
 Great bartender. Food always good ,4
" We dined to celebrate our 34th anniversary. The food was delicious and the service was great! Loved the red velvet cake, too. Our server, Kentrell, was wonderful and is a great find for the restaurant! ",5
" Went to lunch with a friend for my birthday. Made a reservation since it was for noon on Friday. Glad we did. We were seated immediately. Food was great, as was the service! Always look forward to coming back here for many different occasions. ",5
" This place always shines for fresh quality seafood. Don't expect over the top presentations here, but do expect tasty apps and entrees. Their seafood campechana is OUTSTANDING, and a must have. They always have fresh fish flown in and available seasonally so occasionally they are out of a few things, but that ensures fresh every time!  Wine list is decent but not outstanding. Servers are generally always cordial and attentive, but some are a little ""over zealous"" and you feel it's an act, but they're attentive and you're never in need of anything. ",4
" This occasion was for a family birthday dinner. Strongly recommend reservations since the walk-in wait time was about 30 minutes. We were seated once all members of the party arrived. Luckily it was a side table and not in the middle of the room. This made it easier for us to carry on a conversation even with the noise level. I can imagine it was harder in the main area. Food was excellent and service was attentive, but nothing extrodinary. It was a pleasant evening out. ",4
" Often overlooked on Houston's I-10 eatery strip just inside the beltway, Goode Co Seafood does not disappoint. Cons: too far to walk to from my house. Pros: The food is really really good; They take reservations and have a well-stoked bar and wine cellar with reasonable prices; Specials come out exactly as described and have yet to dissappoint (4 for 4 during the last year); Parking is Valet if you like, or self park in a safe well-lit lot a stone's throw from the door; Service is excellent. Noise level is moderate - a good place for business or romance; Ambiance is smart, but not stuffy. Seating is comfortable and ergonomically correct. ",4
" Great seafood, friendly service and relatively good value. ",4
" Everything was excellent, food, service and great company. ",5
 We had one of the best waiters I've ever had. ,5
" Their Campechana Extra is the best in the city, hands down!!! ",4
" I took my gf for Vday and it was great. Service was amazing and all the seafood is very fresh. I had crabmeat gumbo , catfish, shrimp, redfish and it all was great. The red velvet pecan crusted cake was the best we had ever had in our life ",5
 We always enjoy the food and the service was exceptional. ,5
" Anywhere good will be packed on Valentine's Day and Goode Co. Seafood was no exception. With an OpenTable reservation, we were seated immediately. The service was prompt and friendly. The food was fantastic (oysters in the half shell were wonderful, plump and briney). Extremely well run. We'll be back. ",5
" Regardless of the occasion or the number in your party, Goode Co Seafood is an excellent choice for upscale dining! It has been a family favorite for years. From the moment you walk through the doors until the time you leave, its environment is warm and inviting, and the staff stands ready to meet your every need. Definitely a restaurant you'll want to frequent! ",5
 This continues to be a favorite place to dine. We went mid-week thinking that it would be less crowded for dinner. To our surprise the restaurant filled up just like the weekend. This restaurant has consistently good food. Everything I have tried has been excellent to very good and always done perfectly. There are few restaurants we go to that I order different items to try. This is one where I will. ,5
" Food is excellent as usual - presentation, seasoning, portions, freshness. We expected it to be noisy, it's a busy place but our waiter (can't recall name...young, brunette guy) was in an awful hurry for us to order. I hope he does not have a turn the table time incentive as we spent a good amount of money for our party of six with wine, but the pressure was relentless to order anything. He also was more or less shouting at us...some of this was noise level but it was excessive. This is a great option to Pappadeaux and I prefer it, so will be back for another try. ",3
 Food was amazing and the portions were huge. be very hungry if you are going to this restaurant!!!! and enjoy. ,5
 Service was slow. Orders came out wrong. Just not typical for a Goode Company establishment. ,2
 The service was impeccable. The food was outstanding and warrants many more visits. ,5
 Way too noisy. Servers running around everywhere yet no one noticed our empty glasses. I had the fried oyster salad. I should have ordered just the oysters because the salad lacked flavor even though it was swimming in dressing. My friends had the seafood skewers and seemed to really enjoy. I was looking forward to the banana cream pie only to be disappointed again! The crust was hard as a rock and tasted freezer burnt. Overall not a great experience. For the money I get better food and service at Pappadeaux. ,3
" The service, food and ambiance was superb! We enjoyed the appetizer sampler of seafood tamales, crab cakes and shrimp brochette....absolutely delicious. The wine list provided ample choices for all. We will definitely make this our anniversary restaurant. ",5
 We met with friends that we used to work with for dinner. Had several drinks in the bar area before dinner. Service was excellent. Dinner was wonderful. Food was delicious and service was impeccable. Cost was very reasonable for this upscale restaurant. ,5
" Goode Co. Seafood has consistently good food, and great service! Food is brought to table hot, and waitstaff are all very attentive. We have found that we will go to Goode as one of our favorite places to eat out because of the reasons mentioned. ",4
" Couldn't carry on a conversation without almost shouting. Food was good, but ambience was lacking. ",4
" I ordered the whole flounder. Either the menu didn't say, or I didin't notice it was covered with crumbs, not plain broiled. not good. ",3
 Had a great group work lunch. The noise level in the restaurant is very high which can be distracting when trying to talk across the table. That's pretty much the only downside. Great food and service. ,4
 Looked forward to celebrating our anniversary with friends. We all ordered seafood and all were pleased with the selections. Our server kept us in drinks and had an admirable knowledge of the menu and preparations. I would go back again for the redfish with lump crab meat and the stuffed crabs. The tables are a little too close to each other with a large wooden boat in the center of the dining room. ,4
 We had a family after the holidays dinner. It has always been a favorite. My New Jersey daughter-in-law has to have the Campechana when she visits us. The food was better than ever. The fried oysters are the best in town. ,5
" Had seen this place many times, but only recently tried it. Their campechana de mariscos (mexican seafood cocktail) is their signature appetizer. It is certainly good - contains real crab and shrimp, mixed in with avocado and salsa... worth trying at least once. Rest of dinner was good - the seafood was fresh and well prepared. ",4
 Service was excellent--Attentive but not a nuisance. It was disappointing however that they were once again out of the whole flounder. It was the 2nd time recently that we did not get what we came for. ,4
 There are many restaurants that serve excellent seafood in Houston. But only Goode Co Seafood offers this unique taste of Texas fish and shrimp grilled on mesquite fire. ,4
" We rarely choose seafood restaurants because the value is rarely good. This was no exception. For the price, I expect so much more. Plus, our reservation was not honored. It's one thing to take a reservation, it's another thing to KEEP the reservation.. We will visit again but with much lower expectations. ",3
 The food was outstanding. The Mesquite grilled Flounders was excellent and cooked to perfection. Would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants a good seafood dinner or lunch.  Appetizers were delicious and the service was outstanding. It was a crowded evening but the wait staff performed beyond expectations. Couldn't have asked for a better outing for me and my family. ,4
 Some effort should be made to cut down reflective noises. ,4
" Had a wonderful waiter. Food was good. Just had a couple of issues with one of the oyster dishes. It was not how it was described. Everything else, very good. ",5
 I had a combo dinner here and would return with no hesitation. Food and service were both very good. ,4
" We enjoyed such a lovely meal celebrating my husband's birthday with our teenage son on our first visit to Good Co. Seafood!  Every detail of our experience was perfect from our our meal to the service, ending with a beautiful slice of chocolate cake.  The campechana was delicious as well as our other entrees of grilled trout/shrimp and fried catfish.  We look forward to returning soon and our son has decided that's where he wants to go on his birthday too! ",5
" Had dinner there July 8 with a party of 4 co-workers. I had not dined there in over 10 years. Service was good, very attentive. Wine list was nice too.  Ordered Gumbo, grilled shrimp and catfish.  When the order showed up, it was wrong -- got fried shrimp and catfish instead of grilled. No biggie, I thought. Food tasted good going down, but I was up ill all night. Never going back. ",1
" We went to Goode Co. Seafood close to 15 years ago and this was our first chance to return.  Overall we were very happy with the meal.  The food was fantastic and prices seemed reasonable for fresh seafood.  Our server wasn't quite as knowledgeable as some others we heard near us, but he was very friendly and did a good job overall.  Our only complaint is that for the cost of the meal, it was a bit rushed.  Not enough time between the appetizer and our dinners arriving.  The location isn't very exciting, but once inside it doesn't really matter. ",4
" I went with a business associate to this restaurant for lunch. I've been many times before and have never had a problem. Most lunch entrees are $15-$20.  The server advertised the lunch special, without highlighting the price.  You can imagine my shock when I got the bill to discover that my grilled salmon topped with one tablespoonful of crabmeat was $36!!! Because of the business context, I did not raise this with the waiter, but contacted the restaurant upon my return to the office. I've yet to receive a response and won't be back. ",2
 First time but was really impressed with everything It was recommeded by my son in law and my daughter who are professional diners out ,5
" It's Goode Co. Seafood - if you've been there you know they live up to the name.   It's consistently excellent food and good/great service.  My only (small) issue would be the noise level, a bit loud for a business lunch/dinner... but as long as you're not hammering out the little details, it's a great place to eat and the noise adds to the atmosphere. ",5
" The main reason I eat here is the fresh seafood. I can trust Goode Company to provide fresh food. It is not exceptionally fancy, nor will you find them on the ""Greatest Chef"" list. That aside, this place reminds me somewhat of the old standard Gulf Coast seafood restaurants I grew up on. It's a weekly event for us. ",4
 This is one of our favorite places to dine for seafood.  We try different things and everything has been impeccable.  As the saying goes 'try it you'll like it'. ,5
" Nothing really stands out about this place. Every time I come here with a large group, the service and food are about the same. Not great, and not bad, so that leaves somewhere in the middleish. Thats a good and a bad thing. Good because I know what to expect, and bad because of the same. Im pretty sure we will be back at some point. ",3
 Excellent food choices. Amazing service! We will be back in a hurry. We loved the professionalism and of course our meal was perfect. ,5
" The family enjoyed the gumbo, wine and entrees. Oysters for appetizer was a perfect starter. I particularly enjoyed the skewered mesquite grilled seafood. The empanadas were delicious as well. Would come again. ",4
" As always, Goode Company provides a reliable dining experience.  Service was excellent - attentive but not intrusive. Food was, indeed, outstanding. ",5
 We had the special of the day which was mesquite smoked halibut. It was outstanding. Good wine list. Easy parking.   ,4
" We called to make the reservation for 5:30 and then had to change to 6.  The reservation could be changed and still get us there early enough. We were so glad to have a reservation because we had a 10 month old baby with us and it made it easy to get in, the service was soo efficient we had enough time to celebrate two birthdays and to leave before the baby got restless.   The food was also very good. ",1
" Have been here often . Good food, waitstaff is friendly and professional. Food is fresh and tasty. There is no pressure to hurry up and eat. The portions are generous and the location is very convenient. Our Waitress Laura is great and we always ask for her.  ",5
 The three in our party all had varying degrees  of satisfaction good-the trout almandine -bad-the stuffed crab &amp; shrimp-the stuffing was gummy and the shrimp tasted old-mixed-the champachana was excellent but the grilled Flounder was over done.  It was a disappointing evening  I've had much better food at Goode Co. Seafood. Not Happy Diner ,3
" Server, Benjamin was on us even before I got sat down! Asked if we wanted drinks or Campechana?? Can I have a few minutes to get settled and look at a menu and talk to my wife?? The rest of the service was fine. Had the special of Halibut, didn't think to ask the cost. $36 Yikes. Wife had the backed stuffed Crab, it had too much cheese on it for her taste.  ",3
" excellent serviice, the food was tasty and delicious ",5
" Well you just can't miss here.  It's a little loud but the food is consistently stand out every single time you go, it's great for a group dinner out or for a smaller outing and the service is always warm and personable.  One of the best places you can count on in the Westside. ",5
" From the friendly greeting when entering the restaurant to the outstanding food quality and service, Goode &amp; Co Seafood satifies beyond expectation. Fabulous food. A waiter who treated us more like family than guests. Definitely worth a repeat performance! ",5
 Proves to be outstanding for the freshness &amp; quality of all their foods ,5
 I have been to this resturant before for my birthday a month ago in April. We had a great waiter name Josh. However this time we went for mother's day and the service was horrible. The waitress Teresa wasn't friendly. She never smiled. She never refilled our glasses. It took forever to get our food and when we did my order was wrong. I had to wait for them to put my order in again and cook it. Then by the time I got my food everyone else had already eaten their food. I wasn't happy. So the floor manager came over and they bought my lunch and I was given a dessert as well. I thank the floor manager and Josh for trying to fix the problem.  ,2
 This restaurant has good seafood.  There is a separate banquet room for special occasions.  The staff is friendly and accommodating.  We enjoy this restaurant. ,4
 We always enjoy the food...seafood tamales and crab cakes are wonderful appetizers!  The fried shrimp are perfect!!!  Anything from the bar is good. ..great drinks. I saw the Happy hour menu....great food at amazing prices.  That's my next trip...happy hour!  Can't forget the empanadas.....the best! ,4
 I love this place.  But too noisy for business lunch.  Save this one for admin asst day.   ,4
 My family and I went to celebrate my birthday. The restuarant was nice. Thre wasn't a wait to be seated. The water that we had was great. He even brought me dessert for my birthday. My parents love the place and the food. To me the food was good. I did get full with some to take home with me. Overall I had a good birthday experience at the restuarant given it being our first time there. I am sure the we will come back again. ,4
 One of our favorite restaurants for seafood.  The dish I love when it is in season is the soft shell crab. ,5
 From the moment I entered the restaurant I was treated as if I were VIP.  I was seated immediately even though all of my party was not there.  The food was amazing and the service was excellent.  I highly recommend this restaurant. ,5
" We took my elderly mother-in-law to dinner at Goode Co. Seafood Memorial City Saturday, before our trip downtown to the symphony.  This was our second time dining there with her, and she was as pleased as the first time.  She had the swordfish, and Manhattans from the bar - both met her expectations.  My husband had the Texas shrimp appetizer, the gumbo and shrimp creole, and he was pleased as well.  We split a fried oyster appetizer, and I had the halibut special of the day.  All were very good.  Our server Edwin was attentive but not overly so, and it was a very relaxing late afternoon.  Surprisingly the restaurant was very busy - the last time we were there around the same time on a Saturday, there were only 3 or 4 tables occupied. ",4
 Had a nice lunch with my sister.  The service was great as always.  The food never disappoints. I  had the Gulf Red Snapper and asparagus and it was delicious.  The temperature of the food was perfect and the empanada was the final touch!!  ,5
" Four of us met at Goode Seafood on Katy Freeway for a working lunch.  With our reservation, we were seated promptly.  The service was very good: efficient, polite, and not intrusive.  Our group was able to have a productive working lunch.  The food was excellent.  ",5
" Found this restaurant through open table.   Reviews looked good and so did the pictures of the food.   We are from out of town and met relatives for Easter dinner. The food selections were good.   Since this was our first time here or server explained the various restaurants Goode Co. Had as well as how fresh the ingredients were.   He brought out samples of their popular Campechana De Marisco appetizer which was the Mexican seafood shrimp and crab cocktail.  It was served with tortilla chips.  It was very flavorful and if I go back, I'd order it.   Gumbo was good and so was the fried fish filet and fried shrimp plate.   The Manager even stopped by to welcome us and gave us coupons for the appetizer for next time but we don't live here.   ",5
 We had the redfish special for our Easter brunch.   It was a little bit dry and did not seem fresh.   I should have gone with the halibut.    We still love the place.      ,5
" If you like seafood, this is a place for you.  With a strong Louisiana flair and spice, they offer a good variety on the menu.  Noise level is fairly high though if you want to have a conversation with your guests. ",3
" Group of 6. Entrees included mesquite grilled redfish, founder, shrimp &amp; salmon as well as fried oysters. All entrees were excellent. Honestly Goode Co. has the freshest fish of any seafood restaurant, frankly much better than the xxxxdeaux restaurants. The mesquite grilled fish are awesome, in particular the Texas Redfish. Sides of fried green tomatoes and seafood rice were also good. The empanada treat that comes with each dinner is always a treat. The shrimp and crab campechana is delicious, give it a try if you have never indulged in this wonderful fresh dish. Service was excellent as always. Nice selection of beers and bottles of wine are 20% off on sundays/Mondays. Highly recommended, thanks for a great experience. ",5
 I took my fiancé here for her birthday on Saturday night. They sat us in between to private parties and the noise level was insane. We couldn't have a conversation without yelling. Our waitress proceeded to bring our appetizer and dinner within 15 mins of each other. Our entire dinner lasted 30 mins and was not enjoyable. ,2
 The food was delicious and the service was excellent. My only complaint was the temperature of the food. ,5
" We joined Goode seafood for oyster night and enjoyed everythingh and had fun listening to the live band! Great oysters at and incredible price. Service was good, but became sluggish at times. Bar was very busy! The shrimp creole was delicious! Very busy, reservations were a great idea! ",4
 GREAT FOOD WITH MANY CHOICES. EASY RESERVATIONS WITH OPEN TABLE. ,5
 Excellent food. Very good service. Just a lovely night out. ,5
" We've been here quite a few times for lunch.  It's always busy.  Unfortunately, that means its also very loud and difficult to hold a conversation.  The food is always very good and the desserts are fantastic.  The wait staff is pleasant and efficient, we've never had a problem there that wasnt immediately taken care care of properly. ",3
" The atmosphere was nice, but a little loud.  The Sea Bass was pretty good.  The service was good.  Overall, the food our party ate wasn't impressive.  For that price, I expected much more. ",2
 Had lunch there last Thursday. Food was not the quality I knew. Same at the Kirby location last month.   There are much better seafood  restaurant choices in Houston now. ,2
" Everything was fine for the most part but the food really wasn't worth the cost.  My husband thought the steak was okay (but short on taste) and I thought my fried seafood platter was okay (the shrimp were very good, the seasoning in the stuffed crab and shrimp was too much, and the fried fish tasted ""fishy"".  After living in Alaska for a couple of years, I know what good fish tastes like).  The appetizer I had was delicious (shrimp w/salsa mixture).  Will we recommend your restaurant?  We will say we had a nice time and our server was very nice but that we probably won't go there again because we've had better food for lower cost at other restaurants. ",4
 Our first visit and we had a great experience. Loved that as soon as we sat down water and bread were delivered to us. It didn't take Lind for our food to come out and it was very tasty. ,5
" Great food, great service.  Our favorite seafood restaurant in the Houston area.  The Texas Shrimp are to die for... ",5
" Good place for fresh seafood. Service was prompt. Good is served hot and the seafood was tasty and well seasonrd. The restaurant is too open and loud to be considered romantic, but a good spot for large groups or families or a casual night out.  The portions are large as are the side dishes.  Deserts are large as well. ",4
 Danette did an excellent job coordinating our party. The food was delicious. I highly recommend Goode Co. Seafood. ,5
 We love dining here.  Food is always exceptional. ,5
 Family of 3 went here for the first time for my birthday dinner. We really enjoyed the way it was decorated and the service was outstanding. Food was so tasty ,5
" Goode Company Seafood never disappoints.  The fresh fish, vegetables and delicious desserts are always perfect. ",5
" The food and service are consistently pretty good overall.  Prices are reasonable and the portions are ample.  Valet parking is available, however, there is plenty of convenient parking.  The only downside is the noise level which tends to be pretty high. It can be difficult to have a conversation at times. ",4
" Food was great, delivered in good time, hot and well presented.  Service was excellent. The daily special was also a nice change. ",5
" Your Katy Freeway location is so much better, as to menu, food quality, and atmosphere, than your Kirby location, that there is no comparison. ",5
" Our meal at Goode Seafood was delicious.  We have visited this restaurant before and in our opinion it is one of the better seafood restaurants in Houston.  Our server was very friendly and attentive.  However, we made a reservation through OpenTable for 7:00 PM and when we arrived our table was ""not ready"" and we had to wait to get a table.  The restaurant was very busy and we were of the impression there was never a table prepared for us that was now ""not ready"", but that we were just next in line to be seated.  In addition, the restaurant was very noisy and it was difficult to have conversation.  As the evening went along and fewer people were there the noise level decreased.  So, in summary, Goode's is a very informal and busy place with good food, it is not the place for an intimate dinner or a place for quiet and relaxed conversation. ",4
" Excellent dinner, had a great time with my daughter. ",5
 We have been to this restaurant several times. The food is consistently good. The wait staff is always very friendly and attentive. The wine list is not extensive but the prices are reasonable. A great restaurant for date night dining. ,5
" Very helpful staff, the group up front helped us find a nice spot by the wooden Chris Craft boat, and I tried some martini they make with Southern Comfort and it was very good.  The boat is very neat, from the '30's, right in the middle of the dining room! ",5
" The server dropped a full bottle of San Pellegrino on my wife, drenching her blouse.  The bottle fell to the floor and broke. Server was a bit flustered and had to be asked to sweep up the broken glass.  Everyone at the table provided their napkins to soak up the water and the server had to be reminded to provide additional napkins.  The manager arrived a bit later and appeared to be concerned only over whether anyone had been injured.  He informed us that as it was only water that had been spilled everything as OK.  After that, nothing had occurred as far as Goode Company was concerned. ",1
 IT IS A REAL SHAME  .  THE AMBIANCE IS GREAT .  THE FOOD REALLY GOOD.  THE BALL GETS DROPPED AT THE SERVICE.  TOOK A LONG TIME TO GET OUR ORDER.  THEN I WAS GIVEN WRONG SIDE DISH.  THE WATRESSES NOTICED THIS WHEN SHE SERVED US.  I HAD PRACTICALLY FINISHED MY MEAL WHEN THIS WAS CORRECTED.  IT SEEMS SOMETHING LIKE THIS SHOULD BE EXPIDITED ,2
 I had the fish skewer and it was perfect the fish was amazing and a great Variety. We had a group of five and accommodated us well. It was a lovely evening and I would go back again! ,5
 Awesomeness. More romantic than it was kid friendly but staff was so nice to my 3T ,5
 We had a party of 11 and they accommodated quite nicely.  The food was great and our service was incredible.  I would recommend it to anyone - it is a great place to eat. ,5
 This offers a variety of choices for seafood lovers.  A nice place to have a good meal with friends and family. Noise level is fairly high though. ,4
" Food was good, but a little pricey in my opinion.  Noise level was a little louder than I prefer but quieter than a lot of restaurants I've been to.  Alcoholic beverages were way over-priced! ",4
 This is our favorite spot for seafood.  Went with friends and we all enjoyed the dining experience. ,5
" Other than the loudness of the venue.....I don't know what a restaurant can do about that....people are loud these day, we had a lost enjoyable evening with outstanding food. ",5
 You can't go wrong with the specials. We had the Snapper special which was outstanding. Good service and easy parking. ,4
" Most of our meal was great, but I love fried shrimp! I know I'm in the minority, but that's my favorite. Unfortunately for me, the fried shrimp was awful! It tasted like it came out of a box in the grocery freezer section. I've had better fried shrimp at Popeye's! Another thing that bothered me was the wait staff assistant that brought our bread and water had BO and he did not place the items on the table, he tossed them. Our waitress was great and attentive. My husband and our friend had great meals. Mine was a big fat ZERO! ",4
" Our server, Devon, knew the menu and was great! We had a party of six and five of us had never been there, but we will be back. The food was great! ",5
" Had friends from Calgary, CA come in and we took them here for dinner.  They could not believe how amazing the food, service and setting was for the whole night.   A lot of fun had by all. ",5
" Our service was prompt and courteous, food portions were generous and well-prepared, abc the ambience was airy and casual without being too noisy. We will visit again -- and bring friends. ",4
 From the time our group arrived we were greeted and treated royally. We especially want to thank your waitstaff for being able to handle such large group and cater to our every needs. ,5
 Love the place - great decor &amp; menu. ,5
" We were celebrating a special 92 yr. old's birthday. 12 met there on a Saturday night.   We don't see this special woman as often as we would like so this was very important. From the time we arrived until we ""waddled"" out from being stuffed, we received the very best care and attention from our fabulous server, Bailey.  We are a lively bunch and she handled all of us with great ease and patience.  The 2 1/2 hrs. we spent there, we savored the most delicious meals. From the Gumbo soup to the Texas Shrimp to the Seafood Platter.  We also enjoyed their tasty wines and specialty drinks. From the entire ""T Family"" thank you for making this occasion, very very special !! ",5
"  I came across this restaurant by browsing the internet there were many  wonderful reviews so for our 33rd wedding anniversary we decided to give it a try &amp; we were so glad we did! Everything was great the food was totally delicious! i do hope that we can visit again B4 our next anniversary which is 10/3- that a long time when good food is involved. The crab &amp; shrimp cocktail was like nothing we had ever taste, simply delicious we both ordered the seafood platter, my husband said the oysters were the best he had ever had, I agreed ",5
 We brought my mom here for her birthday and she was happy with the service. She was taken care of very well. ,4
" Hope you can find the name of the young man who waited on us.  He was on the middle right to right as you face the back of the restaurant.  I don't have his name but his calm, well informed, good natured service made all the difference in our enjoyment of the evening.  Good food and wonderful service --now there's a winning combination!! ",5
 My first time visiting was for my friend's birthday gathering. A family member recommended this restaurant because they have a wonderful selection of seafood at reasonable prices. So when we went to for my friend's birthday I knew then that I wanted to have my birthday gathering there as well. In order to reserve the private room there is a $950 minimum which was a little annoying but business is business and I understand. I had a gathering of 20 people and everyone enjoyed their time there. The campechana is my favorite. ,5
" Always delicious seafood at Goode Co.   The Hwy 10 location has great atmosphere - a beautiful CrissCraft mahogany boat sits in the middle of the restaurant, and a huge bronze propeller fills the wall in the bar.   The service is extra friendly, and  although the room can be noisy, it's a fun atmosphere.   The BEST campechana in the world is served here, but also try the soft shell crab, Texas shrimp, and great gumbo;  finish off with their key lime pie - all delicious. ",5
" Mother's Day lunch 2015 was perfect.  Great food &amp; service.  Made a noon reservation and showed up 15 minutes early.  Had to wait 20 minutes to be seated, but no problem. ",5
" My husband makes it a habit to ask for the manager to praise the restaurant and specifically the service that we receive.  His manager talks are 90% favorable and his method to push a server and the restaurant to strive to be better.  Michael Simon and Mario Batali always say to provide feedback while at your restaurant and that is one thing we always do.  We took my husband's mother and sister out to dinner Friday night for an early Mother's Day dinner.  The food was excellent, but I didn't realize until we were being served our dessert how irritated my husband had become with the service.  The staff was incredibly knowledgeable about the food and our server, Emily, was a delight, except she was not as visible as we would have liked.  Our water glasses were not filled until well into dessert, despite the manager being within 3 feet of our table at one point.  Mom's side dish didn't come out until she was nearly finished with her meal and this was after our entree's arrived while we ate our salads.  The kitchen timing was off to match the timing of the service.  We ordered a trio of desserts, only to receive one of the three in error and to be short a component of a second.  My husband also didn't appreciate that our wine glasses were never filled, except when he poured the wine for the table.  We ate grilled flounder and shrimp, grilled redfish, the halibut special and bovine oysters.  Each was cooked to perfection.  We will be back, but do expect more next time. ",4
 Continues to provide great food and service ... ,5
" This is a great lunch spot.  I like the convenience of valet parking.  There were no available parking spots close by so it is basically your only option unless the parking gods are with you that day.  The food and service were fantastic!  Quality was good.  Loved the key lime pie.  The tamale and shrimp appies were terrific.  I found the restaurant a little noisy, it was difficult to have a casual conversation.  We had to speak up and listen intently to each, not the best place for a business meeting but great for a casual lunch with co-workers. ",4
 Since our 8month old grandson was going to be with I had requested a table off to the side so we wouldn't disrupt other patrons.  We had a great table and our server was very patient with us visiting and taking our time ordering.  Thank you ,5
" This was my first time eating here.  I made the reservation, arrived a few minutes early and we were seated right away.  The Waitress was friendly and the place seemed pretty busy but that didn't affect the timeliness of our food or drinks.  It's like most restaurants, with reasonably priced meals and an overpriced wine list, but all in all it was a good evening.  If you haven't been you should definitely give it try.  We are ""inner loopers"" so I think there are much better options that are closer. ",4
" We came for lunch, because we had a good experience celebrating grandson's graduation last June. We made a reservation, advised that it was a birthday at that time.  When we finished eating, we asked  if they celebrated birthdays and was told yes.  When the plate of deserts was brought out, the waiter described each one, then told us we could pick out one of three.  It would have been best if only the three were brought out.  We felt uncomfortable during the entire lunch.  The white tablecloth's were brought out for Dinner and placed on the empty tables while we were still eating.  The floor was being swept while we ate.  The food was good, but we will probably go to Pappadeaux's next time for our Seafood.  Only my wife and I came to celebrate her birthday. ",3
 Good service and food. I'd go again. ,4
 Nice and friendly atmosphere. The food was really good as this was an alternative choice from our regular holiday (Easter) meal. I would recommend it to friends. ,3
" Our party of four was seated promptly. The staff was pleasant, and the food tasty and well presented. Typical Texas-sized portions, meaning we all had some left to take home and enjoy again. ",4
" I've been dining at the Goode Company family of restaurants for over 20 years.  Goode Company Seafood is always consistent in the quality of food and service.   While the Westpark location is the true gem with its rustic feel, this Katy Freeway location is larger so there is typically little to no wait. ",4
" Excellent as usual.  We dine there frequently, and it's consistently great.  Love the place. ",5
" Good Company Seafood is a great place for a family celebration. The food is delicious, and the staff excellent. ",5
 We enjoy the restaurant for many occasions.  The food is always delicious and the staff is wonderful.  Reservations are not required but are suggested due to it's popularity.     The staff is always good about seating us so that my wheelchair is not an issue and the valets always help with my loading even if we don't use valet parking. ,5
" This was not my first time to Goode Seafood, but it may be my last. I sat outside on the patio on a lovely recent evening.   The seafood gumbo was delivered with a thick crust where it had cooled and congealed in the kitchen. I presume that they mass prepared a number of bowls of soup, dumped a spoonful of rice in the bottom of the bowl and poured the soup on top and let it stand until someone ordered one. When I got it and put my spoon into it, it was like digging into a mud pit.  The main course of blackened fish was swimming in melted butter, veggies were lukewarm. Fish was fine texture and flavor, but only mildly blackened so if you like yours spicy, go elsewhere.  Did not take dessert, but ordered coffee which arrived half in the cup and half in the saucer. The fact that the server didn't notice that the saucer was full of coffee just confirms the lackadaisical level that the restaurant has dropped to.  Overall summary - they just didn't care.  And I guess I don't care to go back. ",2
 Any of the mesquite grilled fishh are simply delicious.  Their unqiue grilling technique is amazing and takes grilled fish to a new level of excellence. ,4
" We came here for a small business meeting and as always Goode Co. was very loud. They were so nice and opened up the private room just for us so that we would be able to hear one another. Great service as always. I don't think they have the best seafood in Houston, but their service definitely made up for it. ",4
" Had a reservation, seated with no waiting, served quickly and food was very good. The noise level is was high as this location is normally crowded - Will return ",4
" There are lots of great selections and all is very fresh.  If something isn't to your liking, there is no problem replacing it.  The staff is friendly and efficient. ",4
 I have been eating at Goode Company restaruants since the early 80's - original Bar BQ store on Kirby. Stood in line at the first seafood location on Westpark and I have never been disapointed with the food or service at any of their stores. Food and service is great. ,5
 Established great seafood and service ,5
 Great service ,5
" My husband and I have decided to have date night every two weeks.  Goode Company seafood is must. Where can you go for consistently good service,  good and drinks?  Often times we find a great restaurant and after a few visits have a bad experience.  I am a picky eater, therefore you don't get another chance to disappoint me.    Thank you for being consistently great! ",5
 One of our favorites.  Food is always done perfectly.  Service top notch. ,5
" As always, the food &amp; service was terrific! Oysters were simply amazing!! ",4
" Had a reservation for 5 pm for 8 for my husband's bday, arrived 5 min early. The restaurant was empty but was told our table wasn't ready yet. Which was fine. We got a drink at the bar. The seemed to be seating a number of people in the mean time. I went up the second time to see if the table was ready &amp; was rudely told that they got ""busy"" and will be 'right with us'. At this point I proceed to explain our reservation was for 5 and the restaurant was empty. I replied with a Really?? And walked back to the bar area. One of the managers came over &amp; apologized &amp; we were lead to our table. There was a couple chip &amp; dip appetizers on them. Turned out to be ok. Our waiter was great and the food also.  Will go back but hope that the experience is better. ",3
" My mom was celebrating her 94th birthday, her daughter was here from Wyoming, so I wanted to take them both out for some good seafood.  Got there at 6:00, hoping for a quiet atmosphere as mom does not hear very good.  It was tough because it was also Good Friday, restaruant was already getting loud.  The wine and appetizer (camitechi) was excellent.  We had redfish, bacon wrapped shrimp, shimp gumbo, fried shrimp, and salmon.  All the food was excellent! ",4
 We were seated promptly.  Our waiter was  knowledgeable and easy to interact with.  Most of us felt our food was very good except the shrimp etouffe seemed a little grainy and not quiet as hot as  those who ordered that would have liked.  It was overall a great meal and we will definitely return. ,5
" I had not been here for years (many, many years).  I don't remember the food being this good.  The veggies were especially tasty, not the normal bland you find at many other restaurants.  Got the lunch size seafood sampler and all items were really good.  I ate it all! ",4
" Nicely done - good service, nice portions and tasty food. We'll be back. ",4
" We chose Goode Co for our Valentines dinner and it was a wise choice. Their menu items are always good, but their specials are outstanding! Great service, as usual. ",4
" Had an early reservation for 5:30 p.m. We were seated right away at a table near the pathway for the waiters so that was a little distracting and seemed to create a breeze as they all went by, making us feel a little chilly. The waitstaff however were very attentive, our raw oysters were prompt. Glasses were filled without asking and our entrees arrived in a timely fashion. Their mesquite grilled flounder is always a favorite. We have never had a bad dining experience at Goode co. Seafood and except for being slightly cold in the restaurant if was a wonderful Valentine's dinner. ",5
" not that the food was bad, but there are much better restaurants for that price. ",3
" Had reservations for two at 5PM on 2/14/15; we were seated right away.  Our server, Barbara, was absolutely fabulous.  Very prompt, courteous, and knowledgeable.  Both dinners were cooked to perfection and had marvelous flavor.  Recommend this location to any one and everyone! ",5
 We took my dad there again for his birthday. He was able to get the flounder this time which was great. We had an excellent waiter name Josh. He takes very good care of us. We brought some new people with us this time and they loved it and said they would come back. The staff was firendly and everyone spoke to you or thanked you for coming. The management staff is doing a good job with training their worker to make the customer feel special. They are quick to fix any mistake or problem. The staff help with taking our pictures.  It was just and overall wonderful experience. ,5
 Very good and fresh upper gulf coast cooking.  One of the few places that really knows how to grill fish. ,4
" I have been a fan of Goode Co Seafood for many years now.  The service and quality of the food is hard to beat.  Their fresh fish selections are as good as you will find in Houston.  The ambiance is a bit noisy, but it is still comfortable for groups as well as couples.    If you are looking for good seafood that is fresh and well prepared, good drinks, and great service then get on over to Goode Co Seafood. ",5
 Very good seafood ,4
 Our go to place for seafood.  Service and food is always impeccable. ,5
" I love the ambiance of the place, quiet and it's like the feeling of eating in a flashy friends house. Everybody loves the combination of appetizer I ordered. It was a great food and place to celebrate my husband's birthday  with friends and family. ",5
" Both myself and my companion enjoyed our meals immensely.  We had the Chiliean Seabass, topped with crab and the Flounder dishes.  Both were grilled and well executed.  Wonderful service as well. ",5
" Dined here for my husband's birthday. It was quite a busy night, but when we gave the hostess our information for our reservation we were seated right away.   The servers were very knowledgeable about the menu and the new craft cocktail menu. We ordered the campechana as our appetizer and it was amazing. Our entrées were delicious as well. I highly recommend the mesquite flounder. Service in general was excellent. We will definitely return in the near future. ",4
 It was rough all the way through our meal from 20 minutes to take order until about 2 hours later for the check to land on the table.  It's normally very good but it must have been an off night for the place. ,1
 Great service from our waiter who was sensitive to our global visitors with special meal requirements. Thank you. ,5
" Shrimp cocktail was good and so was the snapper.  Gumbo is a cream base vs a roux, so it was OK.  I wouldn't order again.  Restaurant is loud and busy, but the food is worth it.  Service was good, but it took quite a while for the food to come out. ",4
 I ordered soft shell crab and my husband had the sea bass. Both were excellent.  We have never been disappointed at Goode Seafood. ,5
 This is my go to seafood place in Houston.  Always fresh and wonderful daily specials! ,5
" Our favorite in the neighborhood.  Excellent food, service and you never feel rushed.  They don't mind splitting dishes or us skipping desert - unlike so many restaurants these days.  This is a go to place for us! ",5
 great food and they have beautiful environment The price is higher than the average but the food is just great ,5
 best restaurant i went to my boyfriend i had really good time the food wine and ambience it is delicious im really enjoy my dinner im recomended to my friends ,5
" After moving our group (at our request) of four from a six top ( why put us at a six top?) to a four top in the darkest corner, it took some time to be served. Once served, (M..) did a fantastic job with drinks and food.  We forget about this restaurant when we dine out, but the food is wonderful.  We took advantage of the Houston Restaurant Weeks menu and were more than satisfied.  All four enjoyed the HRW menu, and we were surprised that a side order (rings,fries, hush puppies, etc - not advertised) were included!  The dessert - we all choose  pecan pie, which was a huge piece for each of us.  We took some home.  Even without HRW, Goode Company Seafood is wonderful, and the service is outstanding. We will be back, hopefully sooner than later. ",5
 We enjoyed prompt service and a delicious meal. The stone crab claw addition to appetizers was a real plus. ,4
" It was a really enjoyable dinner.  The seafood was delicious, I had the fried shrimp.  My husband had the fried shrimp and farmed red fish.  He said it was very good.  Our food came with a seafood empanadas and a side.  Next time we go,  we're going to try there sampler platter and a bowl of gumbo.  Our waiter, Rob, was the best!  It's a fun place to go, too! ",4
" 10 VERY DEAR AND OLD FRIENDS MET FOR A DINNER AND VISITING EXPERIENCE HERE.  THE RESULT WAS THAT WE DECIDED TO MAKE OUR MEETING A MONTHLY EVENT.  THE FOOD WAS SUPERB, THE WINE DELIGHTFUL AND THE SERVICE WAS VERY REWARDING.  WE MAY NOT MAKE ALL OF OUR MONTHLY EVENTS HERE, B UT WE WILL BE BACK OFTEN. ",5
" Noise level to the roof Food luke warm asked for no butter on my ""fresh"" halibut - could not get the waiter to understand the ""no"" part...""but they only put a thin layer of butter for crispness and taste""...okkei - ""thanks...I want NO butter"" cappuccino luke warm  used to be one favoite for seafood - disappinted this time, big time ",3
" Pricey given the abysmal service &amp; mediocre food...  Empty glasses and bread baskets as we waited for the waitress to come back to take our order followed by a 30 minute wait for the food to come out.  Two of those dining at our table received their food, but the other three diners had to wait another 15 minutes for theirs to come out.  It was obvious the latter 3 entrees had been sitting for awhile in the kitchen. ",2
" Most of the time, the service at this restaurant is very good.  However, sometimes it is not as good as it should be and on my most recent visit, the service was terrible.  We had a waitress who clearly wanted to be anywhere but at work.  We had to ask for more water, more tea, more soda, and a check.  She never checked on our meal, whether needed anything, or anything else.  If this had been my first visit to this restaurant, I would not go back. ",3
" Food was good, specialty is mesquite grilled seafood. However, we could not hold a conversation at the table and hear one another due to the noise level. It was very loud.  I booked the reservation on line a week in advance, showed up on time, and we were given a table along the hard surfaced walls off the main dining room.  It was impossible to hold a conversation with my guests. Everyone commented on it.   I will not return there for a business lunch.  Suggest the restaurant find something to dampen the noise in the main dining room. The restaurant has hard surfaces, floor, walls, and ceiling. There are a lot of tables crowded together. Sound comes at you from all directions and it is jumbled and loud. You cannot understand what  the person sitting next to you is saying, but you hear loud noise from all around the dining room. ",2
 Made a reservation a month ago for 7:00pm.  Seated at 7:40.  Saturday night is not Goode. Food was very good as usual.  Better service at Westpark location. BG ,3
 Went specifically for Houston Restaurant weeks and we were not disappointed.   The food was excellent and service was spot on. ,5
 Had a great meal of Mahi Mahi and coffee was excellent!  Thank you for wonderful service and one of the best dinners I have experienced in a long while!  Manager was attentive as well as the staff all the way around!  Thank you!  I will be coining back for dinner soon!  I have also had lunches prior to this dinner and loved the lunch options as well! ,5
" The food was good as usual. We dine there about every other weekend.   I was delighted to dine in on the first day of Restaurant Weeks. There were many restaurants on the list but we knew that dinner would be delicious.   One comment about our waiter....I was ordering from the restaurant week menu for both myself and my husband, the waiter said,""I will take orders one at a time, give me yours and then I will ask him"" I was quite disturbed,  shocked and disappointed that he felt that his comment was okay.   Needless to say, I left with a bad taste. .. Hopefully this will never happen again. ",4
" The food was not bad, but for the price, it should be better. ",4
" Family of 8 dined here together.  Food was amazing - the halibut special was a big hit as were the stuffed crab, the baby coho salmon and the appetizer sampler.  Service was consistent, unobtrusive, and quick.  The decor is elegant without being pretentious.  The prices are on the higher end but line up with the quality and quantity of food.   Will go again for the food and service.  Noise level was extreme.  Had to speak loudly to be heard even by the person next to me, conversation beyond that was impossible.  My hearing impaired mom could not understand even the wait staff.  That is the only downside. ",4
" I guess sooner or later you are going to have an off night at an otherwise very good restaurant. Our waiter was pushy, then inattentive and finally our order came out wrong.  When we were finally served  our main course after a very long wait the portions were almost laughable.  We have been going to this location of Goode Company Seafood for years and manage a visit at least once or twice a month. The service is usually good to outstanding and the food always pleasing.  Our dining experience this past Sunday, July 11 came as a great disappointment.  I hope this will not become a trend. ",1
 Three of our group selected a fish special and none were disappointed. The food was stellar. We've eaten at the location on Westpark as well and it was also terrific. Great spot for seafood lovers. ,5
 Enjoyed the food very much. I was pleased with the seafood being from NOLA ,4
 We went this time for Father's Day. My dad had a good time. The only thing was this time he wanted flounder and they were out.  The service was good and the food was good. We will be back again. ,4
 Went on fathers's day great food and wonderful service ,4
" Rob Burge our waiter was very nice.  Upon greeting us he said welcome and immediately told my husband ""Happy Fathers Day!  That went over well - since my husband chose the restaurant - 2nd time we've been there!  Rob, new the menu well and made several great recommendations.  He went above and beyond to ensure we had a wonderful Fathers Day celebration! ",5
" Father's Day was a busy time for Goode Co., Seafood; however, the restaurant still managed to provide attentive service and high quality food. ",5
" I had the Mahi, and tasted the swordfish--both were bland. The shrimp were not as fresh as they could be--some had a very slight taste of bleach, which I believe comes from not properly rinsing a storage container somewhere along the way.  We were a party of 7, and they sat us at a table that really only fits 6--we were overcrowded.  While the waiter was knowledgeable,  he was almost too attentive, and he kept touching us on our shoulders.  The manager stopped by to welcome us, but it was somewhat strained--not a great people person.  One in our party really enjoyed their Bass Lafayette.  And the Cilantro Lime dressing was a hit as well. ",3
" Very good quality and taste of food.  Oysters Prochutto were excellent.  Highly recommend them.  Service got spotty as they got busy, but they adjusted and it got better.  We ordered hot tea after the meal but it wasn't delivered.  Overall very good. ",5
 Excellent mesquite grilled fish--halibut. Server was attentive and charming. Bread pudding was delicious too. ,5
" Outstanding all around seafood!  Get there early for Happy Hour specials - very good value!  Our server Annie was awesome!  Great food, great value - most highly recommended! ",5
 My grilled mesquite catfish and shrimp were yummie; bread pudding was delicious.  I wish I remembered our waiter's name.  I feel that Goode Co. has an asset with this guy; he was friendly and took care of all our needs. ,5
" seafood was fresh, love the smokey flavors from the grill. ",4
" Don't know how we've missed this gem the many, many times we've been to the Houston area. Can't wait to come again!  Food was absolutely fabulous. ",5
 It was okay. It was very crowded and we were seated at a table way in the back . It wasn't that comfortable of area of seating given that I made reservation. I would think if you make reservations that you should get better tables. But it appears that my mothers had a good time and were taken care of. That is all that matters to me. ,2
 We enjoy eating here frequently but really had a good time on Mothers Day 2015.  We were seated on time for our reservation of 8 and the restaurant was very full.  We appreciated this since both my parents are disabled.  Family restroom is also a great benefit for children or elderly.  Food was great and service was good considering how busy it was.  Thanks! We had a great time ,4
 Consistently good ,4
" I've been dining here for years and they're still hitting all of the notes.  The mexican shrimp cocktail is still the best appetizer in Houston, and the fresh seafood choices are still delicious. ",5
" Food and service was excellent. We were seated right away, and we enjoyed appetizers,neither, and dessert. Everything was great, and Chris was a greater waiter! Can't wait to go back! ",5
 The seafood is always fresh and delicious. We particularly enjoy the shrimp &amp; crab campechana cocktail. ,5
 The food was very mediocre.... The only thing that was great were the crab cakes ,2
" Try any of their mesquite grill fish and you will not be disappointed.  My favorite is the Flounder, but the Red Fish, Red Snapper, and Halibut are all wonderful.  They have a most unique method to grill fish without drying out the fillet.  They are always flavorful and moist - amazing taste you will want again and again! ",4
 Food was fantastic.   Server was attentive.   Restaurant was noisier than expected.  We were seated immediately upon arrival. ,5
" The atmosphere was nice, wait staff was friendly.  The food was excellent .  The waiter needs to listen to the customers answer carefully and to what they order. ",3
" Great birthday lunch for our XO Moms lunch bunch.  Delicious selection, excellent service. A little bit loud for conversation. ",5
 We love the food here. It is always fresh and the service is great as well. The one complaint and the only reason that we do not go more often is that it is noisy.  It is one big room and the sound is just not great. We always end up either not hearing other people in our group or nearly yelling. ,4
 Your restaurant made our 23rd Wedding Anniversary dinner very special.  Thank you for the great service and great food.  We will recommend you to friends and neighbors. ,5
" Service &amp; food are very good, but a little noisy on a Friday evening. ",4
" My family &amp; I made a booking for Mothers day , although we booked we did have to wait approximately ten minutes. The occasion was very busy we were pleasantly surprised that although the restaurant  was full our drinks, entrée &amp; main courses were delivered  to our table very promptly.  We had a very pleasant evening and other restaurants  in the area could well learn from Goode Company how to provide efficient &amp; reliable  service with the waiters having very pleasant demeanor as they went about ensure our visit was a pleasant experience.  Well done to the Goode team at Katy freeway. ",4
" This restaurant has been a staple in the dining scene for  many years. While other restaurants come and go or fade away with outdated menus and food, Jim Goode always gets it right. All the seafood is fantastic and their mesquite grilled dishes are really special. The details are also extraordinary such as the seafood empanadas that come standard on most dishes. This is my top restaurant in Houston and has remained that way for many years. ",5
" As always, Goode Company Seafood is still a good place to eat, whether its for brunch, lunch, or dinner.  Although the noise level can be rather high when filled out, the quality of food and service makes up for the difficulty of carrying on a reasonable conversation.  Consistently exceeds  expectations of food and service time and time again. ",5
" Food was good, but 2 cars were burglarized during dinner, mine being one of them! ",2
 Always a delicious meal with great service! ,5
" The food is always good, as is the service.  We really like the mesquite grilled fish and fried shrimp!  The Chris Craft boat in the middle of the room makes the experience more fun. ",5
 The food was very good. Had the halibut special and spinach on the side. Noise level was a little high. Will return and try other menu items. ,4
 I forget how many years ago I started eating over on Westpark. A different ambiance but the same excellant food as the Katy Restaurant that I now visit. Always a special treat. ,5
" This is a very good seafood restaurant.  However, the acoustics are very bad and it is quite noisy.   It is often difficult to carry on a conversation. ",4
 As alway the snapper was excellent and the staff was friendly. The crew has always worked with me and my group to provide a not rich casual dining experience. ,5
" The seafood is always fresh, we enjoy the campechana cocktail as an appetizer. ",5
 Lunch is crowded at this restaurant so expect it be noisy. Not a place to go if you need to talk a lot of business. ,4
 Some of the best seafood in Houston!  We always love eating here.  Always great!! ,5
 The food was delicious and the service outstanding. ,5
 This place is extremely nice. Great service! really have to visit this place. I highly anyone to this place. ,5
 The food here is good and I like that I can make reservations but it seems though the prices have gone up significantly.  Its also very noisy.    The special on the table looked inviting but I recommend asking the price before you order - this particular one was $38!!!!! I think I'll stick to happy hours. ,4
 Wonderful food and impeccable service. ,5
" Had reservations. Got in just a few minutes late. All good.   Shrimp cocktail was great. DIL enjoyed her fried shrimp. Son said catfish was too thick. Not crispy enough. My special was redfish with avocado and poco in a sauce. Wayyyyy too muddled. Ate the outer bits of my redfish and it was yummy. The topping just masked all th flavors. Nothing stood out.   Waitress was very good - friendly, attentive ",3
 I made a reservation.  When I arrived I was told that I would not be seated until my full party arrived.  The restaurant was 25% full on a Tuesday night.  Why make a customer sit on a bench like a school girl when tables are empty?  Why make a reservation? ,3
 Great food and service. ,5
 The service was amazing! The server was excellent! ,5
" I am sure we picked the wrong night (Valentines Day) but the noise level was uncomfortably loud.  Luckily our reservations allowed us a spot in the back dining room which was a much more comfortable volume.  The Valentines a Day special, however, made up for all the noise.  It was a lobster, bacon wrapped shrimp and redfish special.  All I can say is it was absolutely perfect.  Go for the food and cut them some slack on the noise. ",5
 You can better food for less. My Crab cakes were not good at all. ,3
 Loved the restaurants atmosphere and decor. I've ate here before and the food was much better. Maybe it was what I ordered the fried flounder. It was blan no flavor lacked seasoning. The fried green tomatoes were not cooked long enough. Like I said I usually have the baked or mesquite grilled and it fantastic. I will return. I like Goode Co Seafood ,2
 Great service from our waiter Fidel ,4
" We came on time at 7:45pm and still had to wait about 18 minutes before getting seated.   Our server, Theresa never greeted us, had long face the whole night, rushed to take our dishes even we were still eating.  Never responded with a voice when asked to bring in water or bread, only nodded.  Put down the bill without telling us, no ""thanks"", no ""yes"", no ""excuse me"", no responses whatsoever.  The most aggravating thing was when I tendered my payment, I gave her my new, inactivated Chase card and she returned with a line, exactly like this ""you want to use another form of payment"" with my card and a receipt showing ""declined"", right in my face.  That was very rude. ",1
 Overall excellent service and dining experience.  The mesquite grilled redfish is awesome. Campechana is always fresh and a good appetizer choice. ,5
 Goode Co Seafood Katy Freeway sets the standard for fine casual dining.  So consistently an excellent restaurant over the many years we have been going.   among other things we really appreciate the white tablecloth and love the  amazing and unique mesquite grilled selections and the many other wonderfully prepared menu items.   All run from top to bottom better than you will find at even finer dining establishments.  Name another restaurant with these perfections.  We are also  very thankful hat they they are on Open Table.  This is one of our few top favorite restaurants and can now effortlessly make reservations. ,5
 The problem started from my forgetting to make a reservation. Still there were 4 of us intending to meet there. All came at about the same time. Two of us found each other but not the other 2. We really needed all to be involved in the same conversation. Both tables in a crowded restaurant remained for more than an hour with 2 missing people. It seems like the host or hostess should have been more helpful. ,2
" Standard American menu...a few appetizers, soups, salads....steak, salmón and chicken. Nothing unusual, but certainly covered the bases and food was well prepared and presented. The service was quick and friendly. ",5
" Dined here before a show at the U of H Cullen Theatre. Great place to go if you are attending a performance. It is a short walk to the theatre from this Hilton hotel restaurant. It is nice that the underground parking is validated when eating there, a $10 savings! The menu is somewhat limited, perhaps not to overwhelm the students working here, (2 steak, 1chicken, 1fish etc. items ) , but the food is hot and seems fresh. My salmon and risotto were very good , as was the pasta dish had by my dining companion. ",4
 Very nice surprise on the UofH campus. Very good food and service. ,5
 We quite enjoyed dinner here before an event in the Cullen Performance Center.  Food was properly done and very tasty and the service was more than adequate. The wine by the glass choices were a bit slim. ,4
 great food and excellent service our waiter was very knowledgeable and had good personality ,5
 Service and food quality were fine-dining level but prices were in the casual level.  The menu is limited but everything is well-prepared. ,4
 What a surprise!  A restaurant in a hotel and restaurant school.  The surprise was the weak management.  I expected an extremely focused organization on the consumer.  The food was good (filet mignon) but the administration was weak. ,3
 Anniversary ,5
" Eric's has a limited, but serviceable, menu.  Wait staff seems less than enthusiastic, but is friendly and polite.  We were surprised when parmesan cheese was not offered with our pasta dishes.  When we requested, the first waitress seemed unclear as to what we meant.  A few minutes later, another waitress appeared and we made the same request, and she brought us some parmesan cheese.  Food was served in a timely manner and was piping hot.  We went to Eric's since it appeared to be the only nicer restaurant on campus and we were attending an Alley Theatre play that had been relocated to the campus arts center (due to flooding at The Alley).  So it was most convenient for that purpose and we likely would eat there again under similar circumstances. ",3
 Before event at Cullen Hall.  Took over 20 minutes to get my beer after I ordered. Another 30 for app. It wasn't super busy. ,2
 Eric's knows how to treat the customer and help to make a lasting first impression. ,5
" We wen't after an event at Cullen Performance Hall. While the food and drink were excellent, they were very understaffed. It took us about two hours to eat and we did not see a server for the first thirty minutes of sitting there. ",3
" We enjoy quite places with good food, service and no hovering.  Eric's provided all that and for a good value. We had the salmon fritata, chilaquiles y huevos, regular large breakfast and egg over medium with fruit cup and toast.  The varied menu was successful. ",5
 Good meeting place on campus easy to get to.  Decent lunch selections. ,4
 Ordered an appetizer but never received it. Drinks never refilled. Extremely super slow service on a night hardly any customers were in there. Waited half hour for dessert before it arrived. Not exaggerating. Took forever to get check. Very disappointing experience. ,1
" Food was decent but everything was very slow, even though it was mostly empty.   We went over an hour and a half before a show but could only have an entree. We ordered dessert too but had to cancel it because it was taking so long.  We even had to go find someone and stand with him at the register to get our check after it wasn't brought to us when we asked for it.  I saw another guest have to do the same thing to get his check,  too. ",2
" If you work on campus and want to have a lunch meeting but don't want to figure out something off campus, this is a good place to have that kind of meeting. ",4
" Great spot to have a drink and dine before the Jesse Cook concert in the Cullen Performance Hall.  Bartender and server, Victor, very knowledgeable and attentive.  Great Austin Margarita and Bulleit Old Fashioned, both made fresh.  Good wines by the glass. ",5
" First time to this place but won't be the last.  Decided to try the student run / served restaurant as it is very close to Cullen Hall where we were attending a concert.  We weren't disappointed.  The Hostess made us feel very special and was greatly attentive and helped fill in when the waiter was busy. She even made my cocktail, and it was excellent.  We ordered the caprese salad and while it came without basil (?) is was tasty with a thick sweet balsamic sauce.  We both had the salmon as one of us has a limited diet and they could not accommodate the pasta without marinara, which I thought odd - so this is the only reason the food did not score higher.   The salmon and crawfish risotto was great!  Did not have time for dessert but they looked super.  Next time. ",4
" This restaurant is located on the University of Houston campus. It is run by the hospitality program, so many of the workers are in training. It is a good restaurant for business/academic meetings. ",5
 Enjoyed the experience.  Have been there several times and on more than one occasion I have had to either get the attention of another waiter or the maître-de to get service.  It seems the waiter/waitress either get distracted or forgets about the table.  Not the level of service I would expect from a Hilton. ,4
" All the meals we had were delicious, the atmosphere is pleasant. The waiters are efficient and guest-friendly. ",5
 The food was below par. My baked potato seemed to have been cooked hours before and was not appealing at all. My Cesar salad was swimming in dressing. My husband's mashed potatoes looked like they had scraped out a baker and served it as mashed. Steaks were okay. They one redeeming thing was having our favorite bottle of wine. Willamette Valley Pinot Noir. ,2
 The Valentine's Day menu selections were fantastic from the roasted oysters on the half shell to the braised lamb shank on creamy yucca to the molten flourless chocolate cake - each were unique and delicious. We've always had great food at Eric's and this was no different. Of particular note is that it is never noisy and the students work very hard to insure you have a wonderful dining experience ,5
 We had steak and it was really good.  I love to bite into a steak that has a crisp surface and the meat was done to my perfection.  I did not need to add any extra seasoning on any of the meal.  The Caesar salad was really good . The dressing was not over powering - it had just the right amount of spice to it. ,5
" Our first time dining at Eric's. A nice experience. The grapefruit grey goose cocktail was a bit sweeter than anticipated, but it was good, nonetheless. Our dining companions enjoyed their martini &amp; Aviator. The seafood gumbo, lentil soups, &amp; Caesar salad were all appreciated &amp; all were tasty. The salmon on crawfish risotto, the sweet tea brined chicken with crawfish sauce roasted potatoes &amp; broccolini, &amp; the pasta primavera, were all sizable portions &amp; well prepared.  The apple strudel with vanilla bean gelato &amp; mango sauce was good. The gelato had a smooth texture &amp; full vanilla flavor. The Napoleon was a bit lacking being slightly soggy layers of puff pastry / phyllo with mild pastry cream between. The timing of service was a bit off - cocktails came after appetizers were delivered; mains were brought before appetizers were completed. And the servers didn't know which item went to which guest. (A pet peeve of mine.) But the staff were pleasant &amp; didn't intrude with overly solicitous service, nor did they forget that we were present. The room is pretty. The restaurant wasn't very busy on the mid-week evening we dined. I'd return. Give it a try. ",3
 I work on campus and Eric's is always a treat.  You must try their Jumbo Gumbo!!! ,5
" My wife and I were attending a show at Cullen Theater on the campus of University of Houston and were looking for a place for dinner before the show.  A friend suggested Eric's in the Hilton and it worked out fantastic.  I  parked in the garage under the Hilton, and then went to Eric's in the Hilton and we had a lovely waitress who gave great service and the food was very good.  We had some wine and a cocktail and then were able to walk to the theater.  We would definitely go back the next time we are going to the Cullen Theater.... ",4
" We went to Eric's before the U of H v Louisville football game.   The restaurant had a great atmosphere and staff was very polite and professional.  The waiter was helpful and did a very good job.    We have been to Erick's before on several occasions before such as football games; operas;  and plays;  and all within walking distance of TEDCU Stadium, the School of Music;  and the School of Theater and Dance. ",5
 Appetizers and entrees delivered to table at the same time.  Entrees were cold by the time we ate them.  Too many people coming to the table asking how everything was.  Very disappointing dining experience and will not go back. ,1
 We had the dining room to ourselves because UH campus was dead. The service and food were excellent !  An interesting dining experience every time we go and should be for all who venture over for a concert at Cullen Auditorium.  We didn't even mind that ours was CANCELLED and we missed the announcement! ,5
 I'm glad I decided to try this restaurant. I was pleasantly surprised. ,5
 Food was tasty as always and the decor is bright and fresh. The menu changes from time to time but there is a good variety. Pricing is reasonable for the quality. The location is very convenient for anyone on the UH campus. The service is a bit slow--took a while to get the food and the check. Gratuity of 20% is included with groups of 6 or more. ,4
" my wife and I decided to try Eric's for the first time as we had tickets to a performance at the Moore's Opera House, also on UH Campus.  So glad we tried.  Although the HIlton could use a facelift, Eric's was a great choice.  Very good service and the entrees we ordered (Ahi Tuna &amp; Salmon) were very good.  Their prices are very reasonable.   Free parking under the hotel made this super easy.  No parking charge as parking is validated by Eric's.  Definitely worth a visit especially if you are going to be attending some sort of event in the area. ",4
 Really good food for the money.  Food was a little slow to come because students are preparing it.  Worth the wait for the food just don't go hungry. ,5
 The atmosphere was great.  The service was exceptional.  And the price...  even better.  Had a wonderful quiet dinner with my husband to celebrate our anniversary. ,4
 We had a group lunch meeting here and arrived at 1pm. I have yet to find the noise level too high. They have a full selection of food items from heart healthy to burgers and fries. They have an executive lunch menu for those who want to eat smaller portions and in a more hurried time frame. After work one can enjoy the bar area that includes a TV. ,4
 ok for what it was.  Pimm's cup was good; Tom Collins too strong to drink.  Unpleasant smell when entering restaurant.  Nothing special but serviceable if you need to attend something at the U of H. ,2
" Our party ordered salads, pastas and steaks.  The food was good.  The service was excellent. ",3
" Our group of six had dinner at Eric's before the 8:00 pm curtain at the Alley Theatre's temporary setting. We ordered cocktails which were good but arrived after our salad course. With the exception of one plate of over-cooked tuna, the entrees were delicious with attractive presentation. Desserts were scrumptious as were espresso and coffee. We will definitely go back next time we go to the Alley. ",4
 A delightful place to have dinner before performances of the Alley theatre now in residence at the Univ. Of Houston. It's a short 10-12 min walk cross campus from the theatre and has a special menu for theatre goers. ,4
 Eric's is always my 1st food choice if I'm able to take an actual lunch outside of the office. I love the $8 lunch menu option. I do wish there was a chicken or seafood $8 option like there use to be instead of just the beef and pork or salad options. Either way the food is great and it's always exciting to see what $8 lunch menu options the restaurant will come up with each year. ,5
 I came upon this restuarant here at Open Table. I liked how the menu was simplistic and the entree items were affordable. The decor was contemporary and it had a very welcoming atmosphere. We went for an early dinner (5ish) and had immediate service. The food was fresh and prepared as requested. The server was very attentive and pleasant. There was an issue with an OpenTable Gift certificate that the manager was very cordial and worked out for us. Many thanks to the manager tonight who handled the certificate situation very delicately and politely. We really appreciated the superior service. It was a great experience and we expect to return. ,4
" The location is very convenient, right here within the UH campus.  Eric's also has pretty good fare at a reasonable price, as well.  Service is friendly, and very accomodating.  It may be hard to have a quiet lunch - it is pretty popular at noon, so go a little early or late if you want to have any serious meetings. ",4
" Decent salad, needs a little more zing ",2
" We like Eric's as a meeting place to share a meal with friends. The food is very reasonably priced and excellent in quality for a very pleasant meal. The service is usually very good, the wait staff, university students, are always friendly, and the ambience is comfortable. Eric's fits our needs perfectly for casual dining. ",4
 I had lunch here with a co-worker and clients. I had the salmon medallion which has slices of grapefruit and this is one of my favorite dishes. Our clients both had a salmon dish that came with vegetables and the said their dishes were excellent. ,5
 This is a well appointed restaurant with excellent selections and prices from breakfast through dinner. The lunch menu is a reduced version of the dinner menu. Service is very good but student wait staff may be a bit green on occasion. The bar is very nice and the entire restaurant is surrounded in wood paneling. Because it is on campus it is generally overlooked by the downtown crowd but Eric's fits well with the boutique-like Hilton Hotel it serves. ,4
" The staff was gracious. The selections were fairly good. It is definitely not children friendly. We brought our toddler along and the restaurant had only two high chairs, both of which were being used. So we had to try and eat with a small child on our laps. It was difficult to say the least. My husband had to cut my steak as I held our daughter. The manager was very apologetic and actually comp'd our dinner. Which of course was very nice of him. Overall, we would return, just w/o our little one. ",4
" If going to U. Of H for any reason, it is a good excuse to go to Eric's as it is a very nice restaurant where students practice what they are learning at the Hilton Hotel school. ",4
 We walked in the evening of Valentine's Day and were presented with a special! We are so glad we selected the special. The presentation was excellent as was the food. We will definitely be back and will recommend to friends. ,5
 The crab cake (albeit $14 for only 1 per piece) was among the best we've ever had -- with good ratio of crabmeat to bread. The pan roasted salmon was cooked perfectly. Presto cream pasta was OK but not especially flavorful. Large selection of wines-by-the-glass. Convenient underground parking and handy if attending event at the hotel. ,4
" We booked two tables for UH graduation celebration . We thought the restaurant would be crowded but it was not. Our waitress was very good, got our appetizers quickly . The entree are very fresh w nice preaentation. Four of us had fish, one had steak. Price is moderate, close to $30 per head. The table for 12 had some delays in service. ",4
" Eric's is a gem for dining at UH. and the surrounding vicinity. High quality and tasty food on the menu at a reasonable price. The wait staff are courteous and efficient. They can handle a small and or larger groups. I am proud to take visitors to Eric's because my expectations are always met. Also, Eric's has that great hotel ambience. ",4
 Good restaurant and good price for lunch. Food is too salty but the waitress changed it to another dish for me immediately. ,3
" I tried the fish sandwich off the lunch special menu. The fish was soggy, so I am guessing it was made from frozen stock. It also came with onions which I always make a big point of not having on my food. That said, Erics is the go to place on campus and I am usually very satisfied with the hospitality and menu. ",4
" This training restaurant for students of the Hilton College for Hospitality provides an affordable option for Houstonians to enjoy quality food that supports a good cause. The food is generally tasty and well-prepared. The major downside is the slow service. Be prepared to enjoy a leisurely meal, as with student chefs and servers the effort to please is well-placed, but, relative youth trying real hard to do a good job makes for a longer prep time. ",4
" Dinner was very good, we had a great time here ",5
" We came to lunch at Eric's for a friends birthday. After eating we all (7) decided to order dessert. When the manager brought us the menu he told us there was no napoleon, that was fine. We started to order and 4 wante creme brulee and 2 wanted the chocolate symphony. We were then told they only had 1 creme brulee and 1 chocolate symphony. We were totally dissappointed!!! It was only now 12:00. ",3
" We had a farewell lunch for a coworker and this should have been memorable. However, during our lunch, the restaurant staff started vacuum cleaning multiple times in our nearby tables. It was extremely unpleasant and disturbing. ",1
 Food was good yet service was poor. We only saw our waitress about 3 times the entire hour we were there. Every other waiter seems fine. Must of only been our bad luck. ,3
 Food was fabulous. Birthday celebrant in group received special treat. Servers were very gracious. ,5
 I definitely would return to try more dishes. ,4
 Eric's is great place to dine before taking in a concert or play at the University of Houston. ,5
" This is an odd place to recommend. It looks like a standard middle of the road hotel restaurant. The food is mediocre middle of the road hotel restaurant food. But much of the staff are University of Houston students earnestly studying hotel management and I found them to be charming, delightful and a fresh change from the usual restaurant experience. ",3
 Great variety of fine food and wonderful service ,4
 The food is very good and the restaurant is attractive and comfortable. The service is iffy - some are better trained than others - but it's never bad. ,3
 Thank you so much for offering vegetarian options (soup WITHOUT a meat base ) ,4
 Good place to go before events at Moore School of Music or at Theater. ,3
 Excellent location for a quick lunch on campus. Great food and service in the heart of UH. ,4
 I really like the 7.00 lunch choices!!! ,5
" Very good. I had the tuna had the salmon. The fried calamari was good too! Our waiter was friendly and informative. For the lunch special menu, they should change the ""Soup, salad, &amp; entree."" My date thought you get all three for around $8. ",5
" Just simply amazingly great, energetic, and helpful staff. The chefs are top notch and always willing to try something new or make requested alterations. Both the lunch and dinner menus offer a strong array of possibilities. ",5
" Awesome breakfast offerings and relaxing setting. One of the better Hotel Restaurants concerning food offerings in the city of Houston or any hotel I stayed at recently. Moreover, while the food is strong on taste and variety the prices are easy on the wallet. The staff is super friendly and very accommodating to special requests.  Not a bad place to grab a drink after a day's work either. ",4
 Food consistent and tasty. Presentation great. Wait staff pleasant and helpful. ,4
" This restaurant's best feature is its location. It is, as far as I know, the only full-service restaurant in the neighborhood. I ordered a salad and capellini. Both were acceptable, but not outstanding. They were typical of the food found in mid-level hotel restaurants.  The service left something to be desired. Our entrees were delivered before our salads so we sent the entrees back. When the salads did come, the manager was there at the table with our entrees again. Again, we sent them back. We also noticed that a large number of empty tables were left unbussed, making for an unpleasant ambiance, ",2
" Although I would not give the kitchen the highest marks for originality, this is the best choice for an ""On campus"" dinner. Our entrees were nicely prepared. We had drinks at the bar before dinner and that was great. The bartender made a wonderful tequila martini and the wine choices were excellent, as well as the happy hour pricing. We will be returning soon to this very friendly place. ",3
" I had as great time having lunch at Eric's. It was not the first time, but it was just as good as the last time. ",4
" The food and service were excellent. Although the desserts were a nice addition, they were notup to the standards of the meal itself. ",4
 They had a lunch menu ($7) which they did not us make use aware of. I would have ordered off that menu which had a nice seletion and cheaper than the main menu. ,3
 May have well been my best steak of the last 50 years! ,5
" Aside from the convenience of being in the hotel itself, there was not much special about Eric's. I realize we are talking about a Hilton restaurant here, but the prices were still high for quality that was not superior by any means. Also, we arrived at the restaurant near closing, but from the outset it was clear that the service was not a priority for us at that time. It took a few minutes for someone even to greet us at the front, we had three waiters, all with different tasks attend us (and we had to know who did what because some were not able to do the others' jobs), we waited on the bill and the credit card unusually long, etc. Again, I may be on the harsh side with the review, but we paid to be taken care of, which did not occur ",3
" Our dining experience was first-rate. The food was delicious, the wait staff very pleasant and attentive, the host was very accommodating and friendly. We will definitely be back! ",5
" The food as always is great, but work needs to be done on the menu. Maybe even having a special of the day feature. Something besides the same old, same old. Make no mistake, what they do cook, they cook well. ",5
" Party of four at lunch. Restaurant not busy - very few tables occupied: one meal served was not what we had ordered, replacement did not arrive at the table until the other three guests had finished their meal. Another lunch entre,the grilled salmon on spinach salad was soupy/soggy and without flavor. Server would reach across other guests with plates although there was plenty of room around the table to serve properly. ",1
" Very good food. The menu seems to lean heavily towards lunch items, so I would not eat dinner there. But it was a nice experience all around. Future patrons need to try the Polo Loco, it's to die for. ",5
" Staffed by students of the Hilton College of Hotel &amp; Restaurant Management, part of the charm of Eric's is their enthusiasm. While everything may not be executed perfectly, it is only because they are in the process of learning, never from a lack of motivation. Even then, the glitches were minor and only occasional. ",5
" We were there for breakfast on a Sunday morning. There were only a few tables occupied. The wait staff was friendly and accomodating. The breakfast meal was good, not extroadinary but good. ",3
" My friend and I thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience. We had not been to Eric's since the renovation, and we were very impressed with the changes. We especially liked being able to see the beautiful sparkling state of the art kitchen. Our salads were delicious and the staff was both helpful and attentive. We will definitely be back! ",5
" Eric's has been closed for a while for ""remodeling"". I am not sure what they did, but I had hoped they would replace the tiny tables and the uncomfortable chairs and banquets. A table for two in this place is ridiculously small - barely big enough for one. The banquet seats are too ""long"" so my feet cannot touch the floor! The food is usually pretty good and consistent, but desserts are awful. There is a lovely view from some of the tables, but you just can't relax and enjoy the meal because of the crowded tabletop and uncomfortable seating. Very disappointing meal and will probably not return. ",2
" The reservation site was up and running before the restaurant was. The ambiance looked nice, but it was unfortunate that we didn't get to eat at that time. ",3
" Service here is always a little slow at least for lunch time, but the servers are otherwise pleasant, helpful and charming. We had the tlapia this time and it was excellent, though the rice bed was just a tad too salty. Food here is always above average, good quality, attractively presented and tasty. This is one of my top 5 favorite Houston restaurants.  Unhappy that the restaurant will be closed for a few months for redecoration - I hope the Hilton keeps the sleek, elegant look in the redo and HURRIES. ",4
 The food really was delicious. The wine we ordered was also great. ,3
" Eric's is an efficient, friendly and nice place for business lunches. It is also perfect for alumni to reconnect with their alma mater with its great view of the campus. I always enjoy the charming Hilton College student waitstaff and the food is of excellent quality. Reservations and walk-ins are handled efficiently with courtesy. ",4
 The lunch we had was alright but not as good as I had expected. We probably won't go back. ,2
" We had a very positive dining experience. The hostess was cordial and professional, seating us immediately, the waitpersons were attentive, informing us of specialities of the day and aiding my guest in selecting an agreeable entree. The food was served promptly and was well prepared and delicious. The check was presented at the appropriate time and we were thanked by both the waitpersons and the hostess. My guest, who has never been to Houston, was quite impressed with Eric's, and I, who have dined there frequently since I work on campus, was quite pleased with the experience. Thank you. ",4
" We enjoyed dining in a place that serves as a school for aspiring hospitality professionals. They were eager and friendly, none of the ennui seen in many restaurants. Food was good, well-prepared and plated. The small dining room is quite handsome. ",4
" fine menu selection, excellence ambiance, the food tasted good and was pleasantly plated, unfortunately is was only warm. the bloody mary tasted as if it came right out of a bottle, the service came no where near meeting the quality of the rest of the experience. You need some serious training in serving for your wait-staff. When the bar tender came and asked us about our experience I began to tell him, and he turned his back and walked away. ",3
" I found this restaurant when one of my kids went to the University of Houston in 1999. Now another one of my kids is at UH. It's such a nice part of including a campus visit, whether to meet with my kids, or to go to the theater, a game, or some other campus event. When my kids are no longer there, I'll continue to support it because the atmosphere is nice, the food is excellent, and we are supporting education at the same time. The activity level depends partly on when you're there. On this particular Sunday it was quiet, but I've also been there when it is buzzing with activity that goes with the professors, administrators, students and their families, hotel guests and many others. ",5
" I was not expecting a lot and received in less. We were the 1st ones at the restaurant for dinner and yet they were out of the beef  featured entrees. The waitstaff clearly does not know what is on the menu and what comes with waht dish. The chairs were uncomfortable to sit in.  The waitstaff, although very nice and courteous, were unpolished in the wine service, setting down, and removing of plates from the tables. The salad had too much dressing and was drowning in it. The main dishes tasted as though the chef forgot to season it. It had absolutely no salt in it. The wine was a great find in that it was not marked up tremendously.  I would not come back to this restaurant. The Sunday Chronicle gave favorable rating. What a joke!!! ",3
" Our server was very polite and attentive but a little eager.  Tell her to relax and observe first before offering to refill our water/tea glasses.  She did fine.  I offer this advice because I put myself through school while working in the restaurant business.  Thank you, Allison Morgenthaler Technical Recruiter Core Laboratories ",4
 The food and  service were outstanding! We were very impressed and plan to come back soon!! ,5
 Enjoyed eating here before a show at Cullen. Super convenient. Ambience too much like average hotel restaurant. Student servers charming. Most food very good but roasted potatoes not cooked through.  Prices reasonable. ,3
 Good place. Very comfortable and quiet in the evening. Very good value for the price. ,4
 We stopped in before a concert on campus.   I was pleased by the appearance of the dining room - very pleasant ambiance for a small group or a couple to dine.  The four of us all enjoyed our selections.   The only negative was the delay in having someone take our order.   Eventually the manager did so. ,4
" Dined here before a concert again at Cullen Theater. Food was very good but service is very poor. Slow service, no service for cocktails -  had to get my own from bar, water delivered as we were leaving, wait staff did not know assignments.   Basic training is needed.  Wouldn't go here unless you need a bite before show at Cullen. ",2
" Connor, our server was very, very good. The food, not so good. The fruit and cheese tray as a starter was a total miss. The goat cheese was ok and the pepper jelly was nice, but the hunks of plain cheddar and provolone  should not have been served. The crostinis were more like Melba toast than a proper crostini. We were told that ""that's all the cheese the kitchen had.""  It should not have been offered as a choice. In the manager's favor, he removed the charge from our bill. My risotto was not done. Not just ""al dente,"" but not done. Some of the rice was literally crunchy. I asked for another side and received some nice fingerling potatoes.  My salmon was very good, as was my date's pasta. Dessert was so-so, but they brew a terrific Kona coffee. All in all, this is an ok place to eat, but I wouldn't make it a dining destination unless I were attending a show at Cullen Hall. ",3
 Great food and excellent service delivered by students who are actually learning the art of fine dining service.  Very limited selection of red wines by the glass was a bit disappointing. ,5
 We ate here for breakfast for the first time. We have dined here before for lunch and for dinner. Breakfast was just as delicious as the other meals. Great ambiance and great service. ,5
" The food was really good and we enjoyed that we could engage with the servers who are students of the Hilton College at the University of Houston.  They were diligent, cordial and very happy to be of service.  They are learning and when you keep that in mind and know that you are helping them to learn and improve, you can accept that not everything is absolutely perfect, but certainly most enjoyable. ",4
" Just returned to Houston. Needed a place for good conversation and food, remembered Hilton from way back and wondered if it still existed. It DID! Made reservations and really enjoyed what is now Eric's. Venue has changed but the food and wait staff is still impressive.  Will return often. ",5
 What a great staff and always a treat in a lovely space on UH campus... ,5
" Excellent service and menu selections. Probably, one of the few dining restaurants which is quite enough to talk in. All of us are parents so we support students and wish that was more advertised. At one point 12-15 years ago, I can remember once a week special student days....those were great. ",5
" Went to Eric's Restaurant on the University of Houston campus in advance to an event on campus.  Since school is not yet in session, there was no crowd.  My nephew and I had a lovely salmon dish with calamari as an appetizer.  Both were wonderful.  As a UofH alumni and long time Houston resident, I am happy to say that I will be back and will refer this restuarant to friends and family!!  Bon appetite!!! ",4
" Had tickets to the Alley Theatre @ UH for Sunday evening with friends.  Had never been to Eric's and decided to try it because of the location.  Perfect dining spot for the evening with quick access to the Alley while they are on the UH campus.  Food was excellent and met our expectations fully.  Crab cakes and calamari were as good as any I have had in Houston.  All guests were pleased with selections and we were able to relax and enjoy the evening without rushing across town afterward to get to the Alley.  Any activities on the UH campus should include a visit to Eric's.  Prices for drinks may be on the high side, but overall it was worth the convenience. ",4
" I went for dinner before a show. Although it was a little confusing to find at first since it's in the University of Houston-Hilton hotel, it was worth the trip. I enjoyed the food and the service was great. From the person on the phone who assisted me with locating the restaurant and parking, to the waitstaff. They also validate parking. Try the Ruby Red Sparkler cocktail. It's refreshing. ",4
" First time we have tried Erics.  We were pleasently surprised with our meal. The staff was extremely attentive and very professional.  I knew this was a teaching hotel/resturant  and it appears they are doing an excellant job. I had the pan seared Ahi -. Tuna . It was cooked as I wanted and was very mosit and tender, vegatables were fresh and very good,  My wife had the CAPPELLINI PRIMAVERA with  schrimp .  Shrimp and vegatables were crisp and a very nice spicy flavor.   This place is off the well travel path being on te Uof H campus. but I would highly recommend it . We will try it again  Very qiet and not crowded. Very nice bar area .   Prices are very reasonable.. ",4
" I made the reservation on open table two days in advance, but when I showed up, they did not  have it in their system.  They were able to seat me anyway and the meal was great as usual. ",4
" They always have the same boring menu and the service is pathetic, they do not know the very basic rules of a decent service. It is something to be worried about considering the restaurant is part of the training of the students of the U of H Conrad Hilton College of Hotel and Restaurant Management. You guys are killing both the reputation of the college and the Hilton brand. ",1
" If this is a school, much more teaching is needed, to not overcook dishes, to be attentive rather than watching the news at the bar.  It used to be better. ",2
 We had dinner reservations before our play at U of H and were very pleased.  The pricing was good and the food was very good.  We'll be back...that's for sure. ,5
" Lack of, and confusing parking, a negative. No valet parking, another negative. Was not enough staff for what truly was a small crowd. One pompous group at one table didn't help that... However the food was excellent...   we will try once more. ",3
" Good food, excellent presentation, great staff. The only details were that a couple of the aspects of the dishes were not up to par. The chicken was dry and the steak was tougher than expected. The sauces were very tasty though, and the wine pairings were well matched. The star of the meal though was the lobster bisque, absolutely superb. ",3
" Our party of four requested prompt service.  We never allow enough time before attending the Alley performances on campus.  The staff was very courteous, considerate, and very well trained. Our food selections were repeats for 2 of us.  The salmon was perfectly prepared to each guests' requested level of preparation.  One of us needs no to very low salt and that need was willingly addressed, pleasantly possible and elegantly served. Thanks for another exceptional experience.  Eric's is a winner. ",5
" First of all, they don't serve bread anymore.  All we got was cold pita that came straight out of the fridge.  The whipped butter/cream they serve with the cold pita was even colder.  Second, they don't have lunch specials either.  We used to be able to pick dishes out of dinner menu during lunch, but now they don't allow it anymore.  So you can't have crab cakes for lunch or that nice pasta with pesto either.  I heard the new director is someone they hired from Four Seasons.  But what about that CAN-DO attitude that prevails at all Four Seasons around the globe?     The hamburger my friend order was fine.  My chicken cobb salad was okay.  But over all, it was a disappointing meal from the beginning...... ",3
 They always do a great job at the UH Hilton.......... ,5
" The service was the best thing about Eric's as well as the proximity to Alley Theater's temporary location at UH. The student manager and waiters were trying hard to accommodate and by and large they succeeded. It was priced way too high for what it was. The quality of the shrimp  was not what I would expect for the price we paid, however, I really liked the pear, goat cheese, prosciutto salad. We fed seven people mostly from pre-theater price fixe menu for $170 plus tax and tip and there was only one alcoholic drink ordered. The menu was peculiar with grilled chicken breast served with a seafood sauce with scallops and shrimp. I thought I'd overcome that by ordering the sauce on the side but they gave me a side of sauce in addition to coating my chicken breast in sauce with scallops and shrimp. The julienne vegetables and rice pilaf on the side were nice. At first they were in tune with the fact that we had theater reservations, but later in the meal they seemed to forget and we barely made it to our seats before curtain because we realized what was happening. We had 5:30 reservations for a 7:30 on campus show. ",3
 I splurged this time on the steak and it was great! ,3
" We had a hiccup in our service the morning we went (they got an order wrong, so each of us ate ""alone."")  But other than that, everything was fabulous.  Free parking under the restaurant (but you have to know to push an unmarked button for a ticket instead of putting in your credit card.)  Nice ambiance, good food, great prices.  We went for brunch before a basketball game and I highly recommend it for pre-game dining.  Then you can go across the street to the University Center to pick up a new T-shirt or other fan items.  I have been for dinner before and found it romantic.  I think it would be a great place for a business meeting. ",4
" Booked a reservation before seeing an alley theatre production over at the UH theater on campus, so wanted a nice dinner before...this definitely worked...food was good, service excellent! ",5
" I have always wanted to try Eric's and support this student run venture.  It was just great!  No, it is not dining at it's finest, but to expect such is silly with students learning their trade. The dinners were all universally delicious. All four of us had different things from burgers to steak. All presented beautifully. I had the salmon and it was as good as any I have had. Perfectly cooked. I enjoyed a quiet restaurant for a change and the ambiance is very nice. Parking is right downstairs in the garage and we enjoyed a nice walk through campus over to the Alley Theater production there. I will go back to Eric's and it is a neighborhood gem and every Houstonian should try it and support our university's kids! ",4
" We chose Eric's because of it's proximity to the Alley Theatre, now housed at the University of Houston (for a year).  We found it easy to find, parking accessible, and a great place for a pre-theatre dinner.  The restaurant is lovely and the service was superb.  Portions were huge and the food was very good.  We will try Eric's again. ",5
 The tables by the windows are always the best.  The service is always excellent and the environment is friendly.  Great for lunch with a friend. ,4
" Eric's is without doubt the nicest place to go for a meal on the UH campus.  It tends to be crowded around noon, but after 1pm it's wonderfully quiet.  I particularly like the special salads (the recent shrimp/watermelon/greens/lemon vinaigrette was superb) and especially the catch of the day--the chef does great things with fresh and juicy seafood (trout, snapper, swordfish).  More fish, please! ",4
 I eat at Eric's for lunch often. This time they were extra fast with service. I was happily surprised. ,4
 Our office gathered to say farewell to our student assistant.  The food was excellent as was the service.  Definitely a good time was had by all. ,5
" Convenient for dining before or after attending the Alley@UH. Delicious food, lovely presentation, and courteous staff. ",5
" Eric's is a nice spot to have a quiet meal.  It is student managed restaurant for the Conrad Hilton Hotel School,  so the new students were learning service.  Our meals were brought at separate times, but it was tasty and well prepared. The view out the large windows, watching the students and fans walking to their first football game of the season was fun.  There was a special menu for the theater crowd which was thoughtful and made us feel special. ",3
" We'll try this again to try more items on the menu as it is convenient to ""Alley Theatre @ UH"" performances.  Location is convenient, physical setting and the people are nice. Food was only OK. ",3
" I've eaten here on several occasions this year because of my on campus activities however I need to explore more options I believe.  The service starts off great but quickly becomes absent once the food is served.  This is the most essential time to follow up if anything is needed, how is the food and drink refills.  As for the quality of the food, it is consistently sub-par.  There's nothing on the menu that excites and for the price (average to most places) it should be much better.  For what I believe is supposed to be a learning environment for students pursuing hospitality there is much improvement and learning to be done. ",2
 It was a great place to go before going to the Alley. We enjoyed it and will go again some time. ,5
 The problem started from my forgetting to make a reservation. Still there were 4 of us intending to meet there. All came at about the same time. Two of us found each other but not the other 2. We really needed all to be involved in the same conversation. Both tables in a crowded restaurant remained for more than an hour with 2 missing people. It seems like the host or hostess should have been more helpful. ,2
" Standard American menu...a few appetizers, soups, salads....steak, salmón and chicken. Nothing unusual, but certainly covered the bases and food was well prepared and presented. The service was quick and friendly. ",5
" Dined here before a show at the U of H Cullen Theatre. Great place to go if you are attending a performance. It is a short walk to the theatre from this Hilton hotel restaurant. It is nice that the underground parking is validated when eating there, a $10 savings! The menu is somewhat limited, perhaps not to overwhelm the students working here, (2 steak, 1chicken, 1fish etc. items ) , but the food is hot and seems fresh. My salmon and risotto were very good , as was the pasta dish had by my dining companion. ",4
 Very nice surprise on the UofH campus. Very good food and service. ,5
 We quite enjoyed dinner here before an event in the Cullen Performance Center.  Food was properly done and very tasty and the service was more than adequate. The wine by the glass choices were a bit slim. ,4
 great food and excellent service our waiter was very knowledgeable and had good personality ,5
 Service and food quality were fine-dining level but prices were in the casual level.  The menu is limited but everything is well-prepared. ,4
 What a surprise!  A restaurant in a hotel and restaurant school.  The surprise was the weak management.  I expected an extremely focused organization on the consumer.  The food was good (filet mignon) but the administration was weak. ,3
 Anniversary ,5
" Eric's has a limited, but serviceable, menu.  Wait staff seems less than enthusiastic, but is friendly and polite.  We were surprised when parmesan cheese was not offered with our pasta dishes.  When we requested, the first waitress seemed unclear as to what we meant.  A few minutes later, another waitress appeared and we made the same request, and she brought us some parmesan cheese.  Food was served in a timely manner and was piping hot.  We went to Eric's since it appeared to be the only nicer restaurant on campus and we were attending an Alley Theatre play that had been relocated to the campus arts center (due to flooding at The Alley).  So it was most convenient for that purpose and we likely would eat there again under similar circumstances. ",3
 Before event at Cullen Hall.  Took over 20 minutes to get my beer after I ordered. Another 30 for app. It wasn't super busy. ,2
 Eric's knows how to treat the customer and help to make a lasting first impression. ,5
" We wen't after an event at Cullen Performance Hall. While the food and drink were excellent, they were very understaffed. It took us about two hours to eat and we did not see a server for the first thirty minutes of sitting there. ",3
" We enjoy quite places with good food, service and no hovering.  Eric's provided all that and for a good value. We had the salmon fritata, chilaquiles y huevos, regular large breakfast and egg over medium with fruit cup and toast.  The varied menu was successful. ",5
 Good meeting place on campus easy to get to.  Decent lunch selections. ,4
 Ordered an appetizer but never received it. Drinks never refilled. Extremely super slow service on a night hardly any customers were in there. Waited half hour for dessert before it arrived. Not exaggerating. Took forever to get check. Very disappointing experience. ,1
" Food was decent but everything was very slow, even though it was mostly empty.   We went over an hour and a half before a show but could only have an entree. We ordered dessert too but had to cancel it because it was taking so long.  We even had to go find someone and stand with him at the register to get our check after it wasn't brought to us when we asked for it.  I saw another guest have to do the same thing to get his check,  too. ",2
" If you work on campus and want to have a lunch meeting but don't want to figure out something off campus, this is a good place to have that kind of meeting. ",4
" Great spot to have a drink and dine before the Jesse Cook concert in the Cullen Performance Hall.  Bartender and server, Victor, very knowledgeable and attentive.  Great Austin Margarita and Bulleit Old Fashioned, both made fresh.  Good wines by the glass. ",5
" First time to this place but won't be the last.  Decided to try the student run / served restaurant as it is very close to Cullen Hall where we were attending a concert.  We weren't disappointed.  The Hostess made us feel very special and was greatly attentive and helped fill in when the waiter was busy. She even made my cocktail, and it was excellent.  We ordered the caprese salad and while it came without basil (?) is was tasty with a thick sweet balsamic sauce.  We both had the salmon as one of us has a limited diet and they could not accommodate the pasta without marinara, which I thought odd - so this is the only reason the food did not score higher.   The salmon and crawfish risotto was great!  Did not have time for dessert but they looked super.  Next time. ",4
" This restaurant is located on the University of Houston campus. It is run by the hospitality program, so many of the workers are in training. It is a good restaurant for business/academic meetings. ",5
 Enjoyed the experience.  Have been there several times and on more than one occasion I have had to either get the attention of another waiter or the maître-de to get service.  It seems the waiter/waitress either get distracted or forgets about the table.  Not the level of service I would expect from a Hilton. ,4
" All the meals we had were delicious, the atmosphere is pleasant. The waiters are efficient and guest-friendly. ",5
 The food was below par. My baked potato seemed to have been cooked hours before and was not appealing at all. My Cesar salad was swimming in dressing. My husband's mashed potatoes looked like they had scraped out a baker and served it as mashed. Steaks were okay. They one redeeming thing was having our favorite bottle of wine. Willamette Valley Pinot Noir. ,2
 The Valentine's Day menu selections were fantastic from the roasted oysters on the half shell to the braised lamb shank on creamy yucca to the molten flourless chocolate cake - each were unique and delicious. We've always had great food at Eric's and this was no different. Of particular note is that it is never noisy and the students work very hard to insure you have a wonderful dining experience ,5
 We had steak and it was really good.  I love to bite into a steak that has a crisp surface and the meat was done to my perfection.  I did not need to add any extra seasoning on any of the meal.  The Caesar salad was really good . The dressing was not over powering - it had just the right amount of spice to it. ,5
" Our first time dining at Eric's. A nice experience. The grapefruit grey goose cocktail was a bit sweeter than anticipated, but it was good, nonetheless. Our dining companions enjoyed their martini &amp; Aviator. The seafood gumbo, lentil soups, &amp; Caesar salad were all appreciated &amp; all were tasty. The salmon on crawfish risotto, the sweet tea brined chicken with crawfish sauce roasted potatoes &amp; broccolini, &amp; the pasta primavera, were all sizable portions &amp; well prepared.  The apple strudel with vanilla bean gelato &amp; mango sauce was good. The gelato had a smooth texture &amp; full vanilla flavor. The Napoleon was a bit lacking being slightly soggy layers of puff pastry / phyllo with mild pastry cream between. The timing of service was a bit off - cocktails came after appetizers were delivered; mains were brought before appetizers were completed. And the servers didn't know which item went to which guest. (A pet peeve of mine.) But the staff were pleasant &amp; didn't intrude with overly solicitous service, nor did they forget that we were present. The room is pretty. The restaurant wasn't very busy on the mid-week evening we dined. I'd return. Give it a try. ",3
 I work on campus and Eric's is always a treat.  You must try their Jumbo Gumbo!!! ,5
" My wife and I were attending a show at Cullen Theater on the campus of University of Houston and were looking for a place for dinner before the show.  A friend suggested Eric's in the Hilton and it worked out fantastic.  I  parked in the garage under the Hilton, and then went to Eric's in the Hilton and we had a lovely waitress who gave great service and the food was very good.  We had some wine and a cocktail and then were able to walk to the theater.  We would definitely go back the next time we are going to the Cullen Theater.... ",4
" We went to Eric's before the U of H v Louisville football game.   The restaurant had a great atmosphere and staff was very polite and professional.  The waiter was helpful and did a very good job.    We have been to Erick's before on several occasions before such as football games; operas;  and plays;  and all within walking distance of TEDCU Stadium, the School of Music;  and the School of Theater and Dance. ",5
 Appetizers and entrees delivered to table at the same time.  Entrees were cold by the time we ate them.  Too many people coming to the table asking how everything was.  Very disappointing dining experience and will not go back. ,1
 We had the dining room to ourselves because UH campus was dead. The service and food were excellent !  An interesting dining experience every time we go and should be for all who venture over for a concert at Cullen Auditorium.  We didn't even mind that ours was CANCELLED and we missed the announcement! ,5
 I'm glad I decided to try this restaurant. I was pleasantly surprised. ,5
 Food was tasty as always and the decor is bright and fresh. The menu changes from time to time but there is a good variety. Pricing is reasonable for the quality. The location is very convenient for anyone on the UH campus. The service is a bit slow--took a while to get the food and the check. Gratuity of 20% is included with groups of 6 or more. ,4
" my wife and I decided to try Eric's for the first time as we had tickets to a performance at the Moore's Opera House, also on UH Campus.  So glad we tried.  Although the HIlton could use a facelift, Eric's was a great choice.  Very good service and the entrees we ordered (Ahi Tuna &amp; Salmon) were very good.  Their prices are very reasonable.   Free parking under the hotel made this super easy.  No parking charge as parking is validated by Eric's.  Definitely worth a visit especially if you are going to be attending some sort of event in the area. ",4
 Really good food for the money.  Food was a little slow to come because students are preparing it.  Worth the wait for the food just don't go hungry. ,5
 The atmosphere was great.  The service was exceptional.  And the price...  even better.  Had a wonderful quiet dinner with my husband to celebrate our anniversary. ,4
 We had a group lunch meeting here and arrived at 1pm. I have yet to find the noise level too high. They have a full selection of food items from heart healthy to burgers and fries. They have an executive lunch menu for those who want to eat smaller portions and in a more hurried time frame. After work one can enjoy the bar area that includes a TV. ,4
 ok for what it was.  Pimm's cup was good; Tom Collins too strong to drink.  Unpleasant smell when entering restaurant.  Nothing special but serviceable if you need to attend something at the U of H. ,2
" Our party ordered salads, pastas and steaks.  The food was good.  The service was excellent. ",3
 Another great experience for my wife's birthday. Thank you Odeum. If they have the mushroom bisque soup... You must try it. ,5
" The food was tasty but took a very long time to come out.  The waiter was super friendly, always had a smile, but was working so hard he was sweating.  It appears that they need to hire more kitchen and wait staff for Sunday brunch. ",3
 It was our second time for brunch and it was great again. Food and service was wonderful. ,5
 Another wonderful dinner at Odeum. Love the atmosphere and the food is fantastic.  Extensive wine list is sure to please the biggest wine critic. ,5
 Odeum is a fantastic place. Food is always outstanding and staff is the best! ,5
" Very expensive. We went last year and had the lamb chops and the food was really good, service was good, signature cocktail were creative and tasty. This time a friend had the schnitzel (if you’re used to German food, this isn’t it) and it was cold on one side warming up to hit on the other, my husband had skirt steak which he said was ok and I had Mexican jumbo prawns on risotto where the risotto was overdone and everything a bit on the side of too rich with Feta and cream. The signature drinks were a little lack luster. The service slower this time. For the price I wouldn’t go here again or recommend to a friend. ",4
 Consistently great food and Service. Great wine menu for all types of food options. ,5
 A great experience from the friendly staff to the amazing food. ,5
 Always pretty consistent with the food and service. Good selection of Italisn wines and a few really amazing hidden gems. ,4
" I moved away from Morgan Hill a little over year ago. I’ve dined at Odeum many times in the past.  It usd to be a great place to go.  However, upon returning this trip, it’s become tired and very reliant upon its past history. The food was lacking in taste and creativity — extremely over-priced for what I and my friends ordered.   Everyone in my party agreed that there are many restaurants in Morgan Hill that now surpass Odeum. ",3
" The restaurant is one of the few upper end restaurants in the Morgan Hill area.  The service was not very good at all.  The waiter/bartender forgot to bring us our drinks and had to be reminded after 15 minutes.  This was surprising because the restaurant was not very busy.  The main courses took a long time to come out and were just average is flavor and plating.  When we ordered dessert it took a very long time and the dessert were bad.  When we mentioned this to the server, he said that yes he knew that they were not going to be good because the main chef was off that night and the staff does not pay attention to detail and quality when he is not there.  It was very bad.  And very expensive.  And the wine selection by the glass is terrible. ",2
" Totally awesome!! They will serve drinks not on the menu but had been on before seasonally which we love -- e.g. The Roman, created by Chris Ward, resident mixologist.  For the price, the Odeum gyro beats it out of the park!! ",5
 Everything was perfect. Best of all food is always amazing! ,5
 We went for a Tuesday night birthday dinner. The restaurant was romantic and the food imaginative and full of fresh ingredients. The portions were generous and beautifully plated. The staff were attentive and helpful. We will definitely be back and we will bring friends and family. ,5
 We dined there for the first time with another couple that wanted to introduce us to the experience.  We were delighted! There were excellent dishes available for vegan enthusiasts.  Will go again soon! ,5
" We sat outside on a wintery cold night, but with the heat lamps it was very pleasant, I actually preferred it. The wait staff is top notch, the wine selection, very good. Price points, pretty expensive. I ordered a filet mignon medium rare, but requested that it be more on the rare side. The waitress assured me that they cook it toward the rare side anyway.  When I got it, it was definitely medium. It was an expensive piece of meat. I should have sent it back, but didn't for some reason.  A bottle of wine,  two dinners and a tip = $200. Not sure it was really worth it. The last time we went there (2 years before) the experience was similar with the main course. I thought it was just a fluke then. I'm sure they're better than that, but with the high price point, I'm not sure I will take a chance again. ",4
" This little gem nestled in the heart of Morgan Hill has been one of our favorites for a couple of years. We gave my parents a gift certificate for Christmas which gave us an excuse to tag along.  My mother had the surf and turf special, father had chicken and waffles and my wife and I shared the 15 oz steak. EVERYTHING including our appitizer was exceptional. We will will surely return soon. ",5
 Food was very spicy.  White pepper was overused.  Very expensive for poor dinner. ,5
 We accidentally found this restaurant and loved it from the first time. The menu is healthy with  lots of organic options and the ambiance is great. They have a full bar. Service is wonderful as well. We've been there 3 times now and we're definitely coming back. I wish they were a bit larger. ,5
" My 4th time here - 2nd time in the same month. Early dinner about 5 p.m. and the crowds soon arrived!  Love, love, love the ambiance - festive and elegant.  Can't beat it.  Food was good - would have liked the crab cake warm (it was not - not sure if it was supposed to be? it was between lukewarm and on the cool side).  Scallops were divine - salmon very good.  Service was just o.k. - server was not very attentive or engaged.  That was the one missing piece...would have made the whole experience excellent.  Hence the 'fair' rating for service. ",4
" On a spur of the moment, two colleagues and I went there yesterday for lunch...a bit of a holiday lunch thing. The tzatziki which we had as an appetizer was not what I'm used to as it was more solid as opposed to creamy yogurt based and the pita bread that came with it seemed to have been grilled so it was firm, not soft.  For our entrees, my gnocchi was excellent and my guests very much enjoyed their cavatelli and pork schnitzel entrees.  The wine list was good, with some interesting off the beaten track recommendations. Our server Kelsey was excellent. The ambiance of the place was pleasant and overall things seemed to click and end up with a very pleasant lunch in relaxed friendly surrounds. I will definitely be going back. ",4
 Loved this place. This was our second visit and neither disappointed. I had the skirt steak which was delicious and my wife had the beet salad which was exceptional (never tasted beets that way). Our daughter and her friend shared a prime  bone-in rib eye--also exceptional. I can understand why they received a Michelin star. ,5
" Folks - the service here is not the best for what you pay for. We went in with a a party of 9 and was pretty much ignored for the first 10 min. No water service, no bread, not even a check in from the waiter. Finally when he came we explained we needed 9 menus, and 1 more wine list. First of all a party of 9 with a reservation for over a week you would expect 9 settings and 9 menus..  Slow service through out. I actually had to think ahead to get more wine and beer for the table. Food is good. ",3
" Tasty food with generous portions and excellent service by our waiter, Jerry, and the rest of the staff made for a lovely evening! ",5
 Wonderful as always! ,5
" Sicilian margaritas are a gem, so good! Skirt steak is served on a bed of amazing mashed potatoes... the bomb! ",5
 Amazing food. I've been there 3 or 4 times now over the last 2 years or so. Our server JoshM. was fantastic. He Served us  - Wiener Schnitzel  - Pork Chop Saltimbocca - Perfect Medium Rare! Bone in Rib eye - (the smash hit of the table) Chicken and Waffles. ,5
" Our Birthday dinner was spectacular!  I'm still thinking about that mouthwatering braised short rib.  Yum!  We said to ourselves several times, we need to come here more often.  And, we will! Our server was wonderful, made us feel welcome and special.  As, we noticed, he did for everyone.  Thank you for being in our town - you are a Diamond!  We are so lucky to have such a find restaurant in Morgan Hill! ",5
" Wife's birthday dinner. Over cooked my steak, but made it right the second time. ",4
 The food is great. I live the gyros for lunch and the pork chop for dinner. Ondrej  is super friendly and makes great recommendation on food and drinks. His mix drinks are also really good. I strongly recommended this place for lunch and dinner. I also enjoyed the xmas set up they have. The lights make the place a little more romantic. Loved it ,5
 The food was fantastic. The open kitchen showed off the female cook eating on the line and rubbing her nose. Not pretty ,4
 Great food ,5
" Fantastic meal. Chris Ward’s expertise and choices for food and wine were outstanding! Chef Sal’s food was creative, beautifully displayed and absolutely delicious! Highly recommend this restaurant! Do not miss!! ",5
 Seems the food quality has gone down. Heavy sauces and fish is dry and presentation average.   Still would go though. ,3
" Odeum is a go to spot for my family and me. Sal, the owner, is an amazing chef and so involved with the community. ",5
" Odeum is always a great choice. The food has never disappointed, and we’ve tried most of the items on most of the iterations of the menu. This time we had the ricotta and pita, the crab cakes, lamb gyro burger, and chicken pasta (can’t remember the name). Everything was absolutely delicious. We love how it’s not a really big restaurant because it allows the kitchen team to focus on making amazing food. Definitely a must-go. ",5
" Another fantastic meal at Odeum. The grilled octopus, crab bisque, veal chop and lamb chops we are all spectacular.  place get a bit noisy and the chairs uncomfortable but the food and service are fantastic. ",5
" Overall food was good, but a bit too salty.  Dessert was the best.  Waitress was great also. ",4
" We enjoyed our time at Odeum.  My Salmon was fantastic, and my guests also enjoyed their meals.  I had asked for a table away from the door, and was very happy to see this was accommodated.  From a value perspective I felt it was a little pricey, and would have liked a little more value.  Overall nice experience, and will go there again for dinner. ",4
" I went to this restaurant with my girlfriend for her birthday.   The Rest is difficult to find; it is located in the old Morgan Hill Granary near the railroad tracks.  For me this was a 60 miles drive from San Francisco but I was in the area so I booked the time slot.   Entrance is on the back.  Parking is relatively plentiful.  The Rest is owned by Salvatore Calisi who was chef/partner of Dio Deka in Los Gatos before opening Odeon.  Odeon is the name for several ancient Greek and Roman buildings built for music: singing exercises, musical shows, poetry competitions, and the like.     First of all we had great service.  Our waiter was Jerry( real name Geroboam).  Jerry was super attentive to our needs and very informative.  We shared the mediterrenian salad which was very tasty.  It was big enough for two.  No bread is served; instead they have bread sticks on the table.  I had the skirt steak which came with potatoes which were not really mashed as it still had chunks of potato and came on a bed of what tasted like baklava.  The skirt steak came with a demi glazed sauce and two asparagus.   My girlfriend had the pork satimboca which was huge.  For dessert we had the panacotta and coffee which was strong and hot.     Instead of wine we had cocktails prepared by their able bartender James.   I find that ordering a whole bottle of wine for two is no longer feasible since my girlfriend and I differ on what we like. But the wine list is full of local and international wines.    I plan to return again. ",5
 Most horrible restaurant in san jose. Not only was food horrible their service was even worse. We didn’t like anything there but for their ambience. ,1
 Worst food &amp; restaurant very rude waitress as well will never visit again what a waste of time &amp; money ,1
" One of the worst dining experiences I’ve had. We were met promptly and seated right away. That was the highlight of the evening. Our waitress was in way over her head. She obviously hadn’t received any training. My wife ordered a “Tito’s rocks” to which she replied “Is that on the menu?” The rest of us ordered a bottle of red wine with three glasses. After a long wait, my wife’s drink arrived along with a glass of wine. We re-iterated our order and our waitress showed up awhile with the bottle which she said “They just opened” and three glasses. She placed them on the table.   The food was one dimensional. The Tom Yum soup was spicy but the lemongrass was nonexistent and there were scant few chunks of chicken. The beef in the Pot dinner was chewy and over cooked and again the dish had no depth of flavor.   Don’t get me started on the bathroom. ",1
" The food was okay: crab cakes (average), Nonya Sambal Prawns (only four prawns, lot of sauce), and vegetable yellow curry (meh). One of our cocktails was made incorrectly. The service was substandard, particularly since they were busy and only had two servers. We had passed by and thought we should stop in and try it once. We did, and we will continue to pass by. ",2
 Avoid at any cost. Very disappointed in the service for a business meal with a new team of colleagues. ,1
" We chose this spot for a pre-concert dinner using our $10-off coupon from the Symphony. Reservations were for 6:30pm on a Saturday night, and we arrived at 6:20 to find the restaurant mostly empty. We were graciously allowed to split one of their Prix Fixe dinners, which include appetizer, salad, entree, and dessert. The mango-papya salad was good but too spicy for us. The eggplant fries were great, with a sweet chili sauce. The Butter Chicken entree was the best thing we had, with rice and great nan and lentils. Our dessert, mango mousse, was excellent, but with little mango flavor to it. The pacing of the meal was a little spotty. The salad and appetizer arrived at our table simultaneously, and there was a little too much time between courses, particularly for a mostly empty restaurant. All-in-all a positive experience, however. ",3
 Many dishes were spicy.  The seafood (calamari and sea bass) was very delicious and prepared so expertly!  Our waiter was attentive and service was very good.  Dishes are pricy and portions are small. ,4
" We enjoyed the food and ambience. The Chinese styled food was great, Indian cuisine could have been better and dishes like quail  was a big no-no. Overall , we had an excellent and a memorable evening. ",4
 The food was excellent.  The service was great. I always enjoy dining at this restaurant. I highly recommend it. ,5
" One of the worst restaurants. It was practically empty, but the appetizers took 40mins to get to us (and they weren't great). We'd been there about an hour, and we still hadn't been served our main meal. We kept being told it was almost ready, nothing ever came. On top of this, the ambiance was awful and there was horrible, loud repetitive techno-music in the background. They never even gave us napkins.  All restaurants in that area were busy expect this one. It should have told us something. ",1
 The techno music was way too loud for the small amount of people in the restaurant (most of the restaurant was empty). The wait staff was very slow and the food took over an hour to come out and when it did finally come out it was cold. I would not suggest this restaurant for more than a drink when you have no time constraints. ,1
" Our visit to M was very disappointing. We arrived early, telling the hostess that we had reservations. The place was huge, but nearly empty and loud rap music was playing from the food preparation area, not exactly what you would expect the ambience to be in a Asian fusion restaurant. She failed to log our arrival to OpenTable. The waiter informed us that it was happy hour and drinks were discounted. Then after we ordered our drinks the waiter returned to inform us that these drinks were not available at the happy hour prices, only select drinks. So we ordered from the happy hour list, some which seemed very unusual. We enjoy trying new items, but the drinks tasted like perfume, not appealing. My wife asked for something else and the bar tender (the manager) made her another smaller drink that was not much better. After ordering our appetizers (just salad and soup),  we waited and waited and could not locate our waiter. I went to the bar and asked why we were still waiting. She rolled her eyes and asked, ""Was your waiter Mario?"" Our appetizers subsequently arrived, then our entrees and desserts. The food was OK, but not that special, so disappointing. The manager came over later and apologized saying something about being short-staffed. We wondered how much staff it take to serve two tables? ",1
 Excellent service. Very responsive staff. Nice atmosphere.  Food is very good. Great value. ,4
 Food was excellent. Server was new and did an amazing job. Have eaten there many times and it is always excellent.  I will definitely return. ,5
 The only problem was how long it took for the bill to come to us. ,3
" I chose this place because of the relaxing quiet atmosphere, but upon being seated the while restaurant turned into a Bollywood Nightclub with really loud music. We could not have a conversation. The service from out waiter Edgar was excellent. ",2
 Excellent food and outstanding service.  Great atmosphere.  Staff is terrific. ,5
" The restaurant's decor is dramatic and beautiful.  Yet, the lunch buffet was very bad with very few selections and food that had been sitting around for too long and tasted old, limp, and stale.  If they can hire someone who actually can cook, they would be a great success. What a shame since the space is so nicely decorated. ",3
 Inconsistent in food and service ranging from ok to send back. They are working on the problem with a smaller menu and trying to get it right. ,2
" Ambiance is very good, food quality is nice too. Service is a bit slow though. People are very friendly. ",4
" Terrible service, terrible food ",1
 Really disappointed with the experience here.  Had a 7:00 reservation and did not get seated until 7:25.  The insult to injury was a table of 4 that came in behind us that got seated right away.  Service was completely unattentive.  When all was said and done we had completed our meal at 10:00.  I'm not sure if they had a bad night but I could never go back here. ,3
" We had a lovely dinner, a little pricey but worth the extra just to have the naan. We started with drinks from the bar, the thai chili margarita is spicy hot, but didn't skimp on the tequila. Since it was Valentines day we tried the Prix Fix menu and we were not disappointed.  I had the butter chicken and my husband the prawns. The star of the night was the naan.  - Enjoyed my evening and the service was good and the food was good as well. ",4
 It was fun but the noise kind of made it hard to enjoy my date. Use the groupon. ,3
 Food was quite good and creative. But the drink my wife received was nothing like what she ordered.  It took a long time for anyone to take our food order.  However once the waiter came he was very helpful and the food came quickly. ,3
 New Year's Eve menu and decor was spot on and very classy. The vegan options were delicious! Every staff member was professional. ,5
" AVOID!!!! Bizarre and AWEFUL experience...Hostess was rude beyond belief and Didn't want to honor the reservations  saying they were understaffed. We had a group of 7 and I had baby In my arms while she yelled at me for not calling prior to coming in.... excuse me? Isn't the whole point of OpenTable reservations so that u don't have to call? She then basically threw us out of the restaurant. It was Saturday night, freezing, and needless to say every other restaurant was packed.. thank you chachos for taking us in. We had a lovely time. Good and service we're great. ",1
 Our food was tasty but it was also cold which made the meal not worth eating. ,3
" Went for Birthday Dinner. Food was excellent.  Great value. Service was amazing. Servers were friendly, responsive,   and outstanding. I highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely return. ",5
 Lunch time buffet; the food was not excellent nor bad. But the amount was scarce and we had to scrape the bottom of the dish each time new food came out. It seemed as though we had to beg to get food replenished. ,3
 Great menu options and service was excellent. Happy hour specials were a great value. ,5
 If they can get their staff to bring out serving utensils and come back to the table in a normal frequency this could be a very good restaurant. But the waitstaff is missing the maitre d is missing and it's hard to get service even trying to wave them down. ,3
 worst dinner..cold and very bad soup and dining.I came in with a groupon coupon and the food was the worst. I have been there earlier and I liked it on my last visit but this time seriously the food was aweful! Not sure if you treat your groupon customers this way! The soup was cold and the wrost. same with other food. Satay chicken wasnt cooked properly. ,1
" Took us 10 minutes to get seated (place was empty), 15 minutes to get someone to our table, another 10 minutes to get our drink order, 15 minutes to get our drinks, 20 minutes before server came back to check on us to take our order...at which point we asked for our check and left.  There were plenty of workers there and hardly any patrons.  Horrible service.  F+ ",1
 I have been here 3-4 times anD i love it . It's great or families and or large gatherings. The dance floor is amazing. ,5
" Great service, made a reservation but it was pretty empty so didn't need it. Great happy hour values! ",4
 The buffet was delicious and catered to vegetarians also. ,4
" The ambience was good, the decor and lighting. Food was sub par and the wait for food after th order was placed was longggg even though the restaurant was just around 50% full. ",2
" Went for Restaurant Week promotion, but was really underwhelmed by the loud music and less-than-consistent service. The waitstaff was either all over us or completely unavailable. Food was OK, but heavy on its use of red onions. Not sure if it was worth it for the prix fixe meal. ",2
" The spicy fried rice was the best I have had in the bay area. Make sure you can handle a bit of soice though. Green curry, gobi manchurian and paneer tikka were on point. The vegetable pot meal was below par or lacked flavor. Service was great. ",5
" Solid food, genuine service, unpretentious, quiet.  Will definitely be back. ",5
" Food: squash soup was excellent; baked napoleon with chicken had undercooked vegetables and overcooked chicken.  Service: We said that we did not want drinks, but we were asked at least three times whether we wanted drinks.  The pace of the meal felt rushed.  However, we were looking for a relatively quiet restaurant in which to converse, and the restaurant was very good in this respect.  My fellow diner enjoyed the California hamburger.  I suspect that this is a restaurant where it is best to order simpler food. ",3
 Team celebration ,5
" Good food and great service, one of the best in the valley. ",5
" La Fontana was a nice place with decently priced menu. We only ordered desserts, though. ",5
 Food and service were good. Quieter than many restaurants in the area so good for business conversation. The room feels a little like a hotel breakfast room rather than a fine restaurant. Wouldn’t recommend it for a romantic evening. ,4
" Lovely setting, easy access from 237 or 101.  The salads and soups are wonderful.  Very creative menu.  The wait staff was attentive and very fun in sharing the special menu of the day ",5
" I thought the  food was above average but not great.  The presentation was beautiful.  The service was also good, not great.  It was a beautiful dining room in a beautiful hotel but I felt for the price the food and service should have been a few levels  up. ",3
 We were seated right away near a lovely window.  Wait staff was pleasant and attentive.  We really liked how he shared a real plate sample of the specials for the day.  The butternut squash soup and fish was amazing ,5
 I love La Fontana and come here often for business lunches.  Evita is a wonderful server and she offers great insights into the menu options.  All of the staff are friendly and the food is amazing. ,5
" The steak was good but  not excellent.  Their definition of medium well cook of steak probably different to other steak house.  My plate was little over cooking, some restaurant when you order medium well cooked steak then you still see a little bit rose color of a beef.  However the meat is tender and juicy. ",4
" Service was great!  We thought the food a  little overwhelming, the sandwiches were  two large due to the very thick bread slices.  The entrees could be smaller, actually.  The presentation was very nice, and the setting, also.  Friendly, quick service by everyone! ",4
 Great service as usual ,4
 This is a nice restaurant good for business meetings over the meals. The foods are healthy and tasty as well.   I would recommend it for business meals . ,4
" good food, a bit pricey. ",5
 This restaurant is a good place for business meals with relatively quiet environment.   The foods  pretty good as well .   The place also has ample parking spaces.   I would like to recommend this place to my friends and coworkers for business meetings. ,4
" Thank you, La Fontana, for helping us celebrate family members July birthday month.  The table was set beautifully upon arrival, service was 5 stars, and food was good.  The waiters song happy birthday and brought out two cakes for the July birthday ladies without request... I highly recommend this restaurant for any occasions.  You all did a great job!  Much appreciation, until next time! ",5
" This is a quiet and clean place with good foods, easy to get to and easy to park.  We enjoyed the meal here. ",4
 This was a quiet setting to enjoy a business dinner. ,4
 Enjoyed my visit. Everything was delicious. The fruit was super fresh and desserts were to die for! We went for Mothers Day and of course it was crowded but the ladies checking you in were extremely slow. Many elderly people had to find seats because waiting in line for that length of time became a hardship. They should have been better prepared. I won't go there on a holiday. ,4
" We were here for Mother's Day brunch, since my husband is slack, this was our only option in the bay area with a Sunday brunch less than hour drive.  It was a fraction of the price of other places  and I can see why.  The lids were kept open the whole time, making the food cold.  We came in and had to wait in a line up that just wasn't moving for at least 30 minutes.  We talked to the hostess in the back and the manager was over to excuse us from the line and sat us-thank you for that! But the hostess did tell us first off, that we were to go back to the line and wait because it must be because there are 10-20 person tables waiting to be sat and that's why there were so many people in line.  Not sure what she was talking about, these people were not together, nice excuse though.  As I was walking to my table, where my 2 young children were already sitting, a young man tried to move my kids and rudely ask if I had a reservation as I was sitting down.   Maybe I'm picky- but this was nuts.   Didn't make me feel welcome at all.  Asking if I already had a reservation was really bad! It was reservation only since it was mother's day. They had too many reservations and had fold up tables by the bar to compensate. That's where we were sat.  We are not into sports and a crowd was standing by the bar cheering on the teams- dads leaving moms alone to go watch their sports.  The moms looked bored :( Thank goodness my kids and husband were cheering the situation up, but I could feel my husband getting upset at first and he doesn't usually get upset over these things, this was bad...real bad.   Coles Notes: The food was gross and cold.  Took forever to get sat even though we had reso.  Overall, do not recommend if you appreciate good food and atmosphere.  Service was the only thing that saved it. ",2
 Great place for a celebration or business lunch. Wait staff could be a little faster but overall was a good experience. ,5
" Our experience at Easter Brunch was unbelievably BAD.  We had gone there before and had enjoyed ourselves.  This time was unreal.  Brunch reservations for seatings were until 2pm.  We got there around 1pm.  We asked to be seated before the rest of our party arrived.  The table we were shown was next to the kitchen where the carts and waiters were crossing through.  We finally were shown an acceptable table.  When we went out to the buffet, most of the pastries, toast etc were gone.  The seafood consisted of empty king crab shells and very few shrimp.   The hot dishes were lukewarm.  We did get a carafe of coffee and a glass of mimosa.  After that the wait staff proceeded to start cleaning up.  There was no time for the carving station or the omelets.  My husband managed to stop someone to get a bagel for us (just one), and then had to find someone to get it toasted.  All of this for $300.00.  We had to pay before we were seated and a tip was included.  There was no food and no service.  I left a message for Rashid (purportedly the restaurant manager) and have not heard from him or anyone else. ",1
 The food is in the front lobby.  They added on a tip but didn't tell us   You had to pay before getting seated.   We were there early but it seemed that they were already out of items.  The signs by each food item didn't match what was in the pan.  The carving station was really stingy in their cuts.    The food wasn't that good. And certainly not worth the value that we paid.  We won't go back. ,2
" The food quality was poor. I had the French onion soup.  It was a bit sour, possibly spoiled.  My Cobb salad was tasteless. The chicken was dried and overcooked.  The service and ambience were good, but if the food is poor, the entire experience is ruined. ",3
 Great place for business lunches.  Quiet enough for conversation without others listening in.  Food was very good and the service was great. ,4
" I like this place, cozy, friendly and good food! We have preset Manuel, every choice is good, we are relax and enjoy chatting in this place. ",5
" Valentine's dinner was the occasion &amp; we ate here many years ago, which I remember everything being very good, but this time the dinners were not up to par. Her meal: The Lobster Bisque appetizer &amp; Poached Pear dessert were excellent, but the duck in the Pan Seared Duck Breast dinner was overcooked &amp; “Port wine-sundried cherries” were too much/overpowered everything else, plus the “patty pan” mini yellow squash seemed undercooked. His meal: The Sonoma Greens Salad appetizer &amp; Chocolate Mousse dessert were excellent, as was the salmon itself in the Short Smoked Salmon dinner, but the chard was bland/wilting (overcooked?) &amp; the “patty pan” mini yellow squash seemed undercooked. On a high note, the service was outstanding &amp; the desserts were very delicious! ",4
" We were very pleased with the ambiance and the service, which was prompt and courteous. Everyone in the group expressed great satisfaction with the food, actually praised the taste, preparation and the quantity of the food. The noise level was acceptable and we had very little difficulty talking the length of the table with nine guests. The restaurant was full but the tables were not crowded and the restaurant was light and cheerful.   I will definitely eat at this restaurant often and will recommend it to others. ",4
 Thank you to the professional La Fontana staff for another great business lunch. ,4
 made reservation online for 730 because that was what was available  When I got here the place was empty! So right away I'm wondering why I could not get in earlier? So the waiter says they are closed on the weekend??? Weird but they served us. Last I wanted the pork chops  which where on the online menu but not on the real menu ,2
 Many thanks for the nice round table and the nice lunches prepared for our Christmas luncheon. ,4
 I have been coming here for years. I love the changes made a few years back. The food is great and the friendly service is good. They have two places u can eat in one more intimate and the other for the more social. Either area is great. You can watch the game while having a great meal. ,5
 The food was not well cooked and had to be cooked again! ,3
" good location, reasonably priced and reasonably quiet for a good business lunch. ",4
" Pleasant, fine menu, good for conversation.   The service was very good. ",5
 Atmosphere was nice.  Quiet.  Reservation was ready so no waiting and the food  was very good.  We were at a convention across the street so it was nice to have a relaxing place to enjoy our dinner. I had eaten there before so knew it would be a good choice ,5
 We all had a cocktail and the mango salmon salad.  We loved the cocktails and the salad was great. ,5
 The food is always very good and the noise level is nice! ,4
" Food was ok. I tight the piccata was greasy there was a huge party that came in with at least 7 young children that were so loud and misbehaved. The parents were enjoying the adult company side of the table  and could have cared less (hate that) ruined my business meal with my colleagues.  Very average Italian food and yes, I'm Italian. Probably would not return. ",3
" Great food, service, ambience.  Love the Read Option ",5
" Upon entering the restaurant we were at first disappointed until we realized the pub is separate from the actual sit down restaurant.  Our waiter was amazing, he was personable and made wonderful suggestions for drink and menu. We asked about tasting menu and he immediately ask Chef if it was possible. Luckily for us it was a yes and we were delighted with 8 excellent courses. There wasn't one course that was just okay like sometimes happens. We loved everything presented. We were treated to table side cutting of the steak course.  My friends also enjoyed every signature cocktail they tried. ",5
" Went here on a Friday evening for a friend's birthday, there were three of us and had a really good time.  Our waiter Patrick was awesome and overall serve was awesome.  Ordered appetizers (crispy pork croquettes, Ahi tuna tartare), two entrees of steaks (shared it), three side dishes, two deserts and three bottles of wine.  I thought the steak (prime dry-aged NY bone-in cut  and Wagyu, med-rare) was just okay and liked the Brussels sprouts side dish the best...maybe it was just me. ",5
 Celebration of new job ,4
" Excellent restaurant, very good steaks and other entrees are available for those who want something else. Good wine list. Staff is attentive and professional. Overall very good. ",5
 Service and food was exceptional for my 75th. birthday dinner. However a $286 dinner is a bit overpriced. $150 would have been more appropriate for what we ate. ,4
 My husband and I went there for date night. The service and food were both fantastic. We will definitely be back again ,5
 Excellent! I enjoy the atmosphere and food. The size of Appetizers are appropriate. And prime rib is excellent. Finally I took a cheesecake. It also delicious! ,5
" Excellent steak, delicious wine selection, very good and knowledgable waiter, the only tip I would give is I prefer my asparagus to be whole, a bowl of pre cut feels like syems and pieces ",5
 Anniversary dinner ,5
 Great food and wonderful service. ,5
" After three years (to the day) of dining at this Mina outpost, I've become a bit of on expert on the menu. They've made the appropriate changes throughout the years, weathered management and exec chef changes. The steak staff has seen it all, and always maintained the utmost quality and service. It remains my favorite place to dine across the world.   Allow me to recommend the famous Mina ahi tuna tartare as a starter. The bone-in New York from Allen Brothers for the main course. The cocktails are second to none, the current special Kaizen made with the their own personal barrel of Sonoma Distillery's finest. ",5
 Great service. Steak cooked to perfection. ,5
 Way - and I mean WAY over-priced.  Presentation A+. Service A+.  Food =  C-   Cost / value = very poor.   55$ Steak was served cold.  Didn't fix it.  Didn't apologize.  Oh and btw - no views of the stadium. ,2
" My wife and I had dinner there last Friday 4 August. Greeter at front door was very nice, Ryan our waiter was great, Tuna Tartare was good, creamed spinach was ok, the bone-in NY steak was horrible. The steak had gristle and was really tough, probably the worse steak we have ever had, including grocery store steak. QC must have been asleep that night to let a steak like that get through. My wife and I shared the dinner, had a bottle of wine and two drinks and the bill was $270 incl. tax w/o tip, big bill, little value. ",2
 Amazing service - amazing food - one of my favorites in the Bay Area ,5
" Excellent service and food, always a family favorite ",5
" Top Service, Food Quality excellent! Very good wine recommemdation. ",5
 Food and service was amazing!! ,5
 Best stake in the area (and even further out) - perfectly cooked and high quality meat - also very good espresso ,4
" An expensive place for the average person. With no appetizers and dessert, we spent  around $170 with tax and tip, ",4
 Always a great meal here with an extensive wine list as well. ,5
" Outstanding wines, steaks that are out of this world, and they brought a delicious birthday treat for my husband on the house! Definitely will be a repeat customer. ",5
 Too. Expensive and too noisy. ,1
 Steak was near perfect. Cream spinach was too salty.yummy for the mac n cheese.. It was our daughter's civil wedding and we celebrated just for the family. Thank you for the  dessert for the occasion.  Service was exceptional. ,5
" I hadn't been here in a while and after going this time I remembered why I hadn't come in a while. Me and my dining partner asked for 2 filets medium rare. Both were cooked differently: one was over and one was under. Its a STEAK place! If you can't cook steak properly well then, that's not great is it? We were one of two groups total there on a Friday night and our food took over 25 minutes to arrive. Can't imagine why. Very sub par and for the price, just don't..... ",2
" This was my second time at Bourbon Steak and my date's first time.  We had an OUTSTANDING time!  Our server actually remembered me from when I was there previously... about 6 months previously!  The service was outstanding, the food amazing, and my date even had an $85 glass of excellent French wine.  We also enjoyed a great whiskey flight.  We'll definitely be back! ",5
" Excellent steak (again) accompanied with good service and tasty wines, what more can you ask? ",4
" I was VERY impressed by the food and staff at Bourbon. From the host at entry, to our lovely waiter Jansen, to the other servers. Everyone went out of their way to ensure that our meal and experience was top notch. They all shook the birthday person's hand and Jansen made sure that none of the food contained  my many allergy triggering foods. Steak was perfectly prepared, crispy tuna poppers were a tasty little starter.  My only critiques. Lobster Pot Pie (LPP) amazing flavor, great lobster. I would just mention to people that it's not as big as the pot it's served in. It's a decadent meal, but not enormous.  The valet parking, so our meal lasted longer than 2 hours, we had cocktails, appetizers, LPP, steak, after dinner drinks and dessert. Surely, after spending $300 on food, drinks and tip the valet parking fee should be waived, no? A truly great meal never ends in two hours! And it was indeed a great meal.  Dessert wise, my strawberry cheesecake was good. The complimentary birthday cake item was ok.  Not sure if I was full from the rest of the meal, but I didn't finish either and that never happens! ",5
" very good food - the guys said the steaks were outstanding!  the service was excellent, all in all a very positive experience for a Business dinner. ",5
" Amazing quality food. The staff was very attentive and helpful. The restaurant is more high-end than I expected, which is nice. Nice decor. ",5
 wagyu...bomb! Butterfly fish...delish. Complimentary fries &amp; mashed potato...on point. Drinks...omg and @ the pub afterwards too. -asked bartender to give me a Rec and it was amazing! Server...amazing service! Jerome? ,5
 Very pricey for the quality of the food in all categories ,3
" I was a little intimadated at first when we walked into the bar but we quickly found seats and the bartenders were welcoming, friendly and helpful as we waited for our friend.  When our friend arrived we dined in Bourbon Steak, not the pub.  The food was excellent and all three of us loved it.  Great Michael Mina restaurant and we will for sure be back. ",5
" I've eaten great restaurants all over the world and Bourbon st was as good as any. The service was incomparable, the waiter incredibly knowledgeable, friendly but totally professional and enthusiastic about us as diners as well as the chef and food. Can't recommend it enough. And the wine list was stellar. Not inexpensive but you would not expect a place of this quality to be so. ",5
 Super disappointing and overrated. Not up to the level of other Michael Mina restaurants. A small step above sizzler. ,2
" Dry aged steak and spot prawn were ran out at the time we arrived. The appetizer were firm and hard to swallow. The NY steak were hard too, even worse than the one I cook at home. ",1
" We had the Valentine menu and it was a great value with great food.  The waiter seemed rush, must be because they were fully booked for Valentine.   We were never asked for the wine or upgrade menu option.  We both loved our duck and branzino dishes.   The fish and the truffle macaroni and  cheese was really good.  Will skip the souffle next time.   I would do Valentine dinner here again because of  great value and might come back to taste the regular menu ",4
" Atmosphere was great for Valentine's Day, relatively quiet and intimate.  Duck was well prepared along with the filet mignon. ",5
" Initial impression was good but the meal went downhill from there. Atmosphere was nice. Server was extremely nice but had too many tables. Every time (literally every time) we needed water, more wine, or anything we had to flag our waiter down. Both of our steaks came out at the wrong temp. My wife sent hers back but I just ate mine. It's a steakhouse and at the very minimum I expect to get my steak prepared per my order. Overall the food was good once corrected but I don't think we will return. I think for the price and service there are better steakhouse alternatives. ",2
" We love Faultline! Conscious Capitalism Bay Area chapter had a group event here in November (and hope to have more), and the other night the Board committee for the South Bay met for dinner and a little annual planning. Service is always exceptional, great beer and food, and they seated us in a corner so it was nice and quiet. ",5
" All was good. Had burger and fries. Burger was good +, fries were lukewarm. ",3
" Left special comments and told hostess twice we were celebrating 2 promotions and I thought something could be done but nothing happened.  VERY underwhelmed by the menu in the dining room.  If I knew the choices were that limited, we would have stayed at the bar. ",2
" Had a brief delay in service and the manager was ALL OVER IT! Made it right, personally waited on us and comped a few drinks for the delay. She came back several times to be sure we were happy and well taken care of. EXCELLENT managerial skills. I would return again and again because of her attention. ",4
 Excellent service. A bit noisy but it’s a brew pub ,5
 This place is good for small groups. You can enjoy casual conversation and the food / price is decent and affordable. ,4
" This place was amazing. I would definitely recommend the beer flight. All of their food dishes that we tried were amazing. The service was great! All staff were so attentive and nice. It was much more upscale than we were anticipating, but the price was still great as well. I definitely plan on going back with all of my friends! ",5
" Our server was very slow to show up at the table or even acknowledge our presence.  We ordered the bagel bites and cheese dip appetizer which was delivered as thin cheese soup and very few bagel pieces, and took an exceptionally long time to get to the table.  We had also ordered a flight of beer, which was delivered alongside the appetizer.  The entre came put fairly quickly and the presentation was good.  The meal itself was not.  I had ordered the bbq brisket sandwich, which was surprisingly greasy.  It was clearly not made that day.  In order to hold the sandwich, I had to use a napkin to dry up the outside of the bread.  The sandwich was barely edible.  It is evident that the food is not the draw to this restaurant.  The biggest disappointment was the beer.  Of the ten beers on the flight, three were passable.  The beer styles were mostly traditional, but the ones that were an attempt at originality were poorly executed.  In my opinion, the dinner menu needs to be reworked significantly.  If you are going to have a limited menu, it should be good quality.  As a brewery, the brewmaster should look for other work. ",1
" Food ok. Service poor even aside from forgetting our order and having to retake it. The drinks took 30+ minutes, this at a brewery mind you. One that was more empty than full while we were there. Cannot recommend. ",2
" We were visiting from out of state and found this for Octoberfest. Great German sausage. Our server had a very large party and several other tables, so he was slow to greet us and our food arrived before my husband's beer did. A little disappointed! Once the big table left he became more attentive, but by this time we were finished with our meal and ready to leave. ",4
" Food was good. The spatzel that my partner ordered was yummy and I was pretty jealous of his food. I got a grilled cheese with tomato soup. I think I’m just not used to grilled cheeses that deviate from the norm. It used Havarti which was great! But it had a really tart and tangy apple mustard that I wasn’t the biggest fan of. Also, I’m used to creamier tomato soups and this one wasn’t that. But these are my personal preferences - the food was still good outside of those. It was pretty quiet and sparse in the main dining room even though it was Saturday night. I guess people usually come here for lunch since it’s in the business district of Santa Clara. The beer sampler was really nice. Both my partner and I enjoyed it. We also liked the pretzel bread with beer cheese fondue and I wished I knew the recipe for it. It was very yummy. I think overall that their Oktoberfest special they have going on now is really good food. I’m not sure what they have there in place usually. ",4
 Expensive. Came for a lunch date and was over $90 with 1 glass Chardonnay and 3 beers.  Would only come for business. ,3
 Birthday dinner that was amazing ,5
" Good beer, good salad. Servers are attentive. Was not busy before the 49niners vs broncos game which was nice because we were starving and short on time. They got us in and out for a quick beer and meal before the game. ",5
 Good food and service but very very noisy ... not good for conversing ,4
" Very slow service and long waiting time, but good place to have beers and some snacks. ",3
" Our server Dave was amazing. The food was delicious, service on point, and the beer... oh the beer. ",5
" It was noisy and service was slow. However, the ambience was comfortable. We chose to sit at the patio to get away from the noise. ",2
" Faultline featured an average menu with reasonable prices. The noise level was a bit too much for my taste, as building/room acoustics provided way too much interference from my ability to listen to normal table side conversation. It even made it difficult to hear our server. Please note the time of our reservation was at peak service. Parking can be difficult as well. ",2
" Great selection of beer, but the food menu has become smaller. My choice, the fish of the day (Halibut) was seriously overcooked and dried out.  A disappointing lunch from a once popular Silicon Valley hangout. ",3
 Good selection of craft brews made right at the location.  Good ambience for a vibrant gathering. ,4
" Some dishes hotter than others, Dirty Chips would have been better if served hot or warm instead of room temperature. ",3
" First time I have gone here for lunch. I ordered a  salad and my lunch partner ordered the burger.  My salad was over dressed, but still edible.  The food came out very quickly and we had great service.   Overall, it was good, not great. ",3
 Great service ,5
" This restaurant is good for after work with co-worker pals.  However, the food was just so-so.  Not bad, just not great.  Our table had the ribs - kind of fatty and mushy, sauce good.   Someone had the 1/2 chicken it it was kind of ""wet"" looking. She said the flavor was fine, but it was just chicken.   Someone else had French Dip and he said it was good.  Lastly, one person had the sausage appetizer; she said not bad, but wasn't overly impressed.  The wait staff was attentive and friendly.     Would I go there again, yes.  Would I go out-of-my-way to go back, probably not. ",3
 My mother's burger we sent back twice and still can't it raw. ,1
 And the cocktails are awful Such a shame as the place is really nice They just went cheap on everything! ,2
" Very comfortable place, well laid out with a great bar area and cozy seated dining area. Nice view of the pond, ducks etc from the table where we were seated. The food was OK - the burgers were a little dry, as were the ribs. The calamari appetizer was great - definitely will order again. ",4
" It's exactly what you think it is going to be: decent food and beer.  There is plenty of seating too, so even if they are busy, turnover is pretty good. ",4
" The food was meh. The burgers were burned, the fries were not as good as we were told. They did not give us more water or check in on us. They only checked on us when they gave us the check. ",4
" maaaaaaaaaaaan okay so just walking thru the parking lot i knew this was guna be my new saturday night spot!  the smells were AMAZING!  so theres a full bar in this restaurant  and its classy! so much good stuff to say idk where to start ok the food omg so the faultline burger is amazing! the menu is kind of expensive so we decided to yknow go a lil cheaper and get the burger the first time there just to see if its worth getting a 31$ steak next time and YES it is worth it! they put so much care into the food you can taste it! the view out back is awesome theres a duck pond and an area to take a stroll after yur meal.  the beer flight!... so good! great beers! i didnt get to visit the bar but you can tell they have a good selection just from the beer flight! everything was just so great i dont understand why this place doesnt get more run!  i give it a solid 5 stars! the staff all pitch in to make it a great experience we even got a visit from one of the cooks!  i will be spending a lot of $ here in the future, if youre on the fence about giving this place a shot i hope my review tilts you over the fence and you go because you will not be disappointed! open saturdays 5pm-10pm we went at about 6pm and there was maybe a dozen people in there so if your hungry and want to visit a place youre guna keep going back to try the fault line brewery it truly is a hidden gem in the sunnyvale/santa clara area! ",5
" Fish and chips were best I've had in a long time, and the ability to build a flight of multiple beer flavors at a reasonable price ($1.50 / sample size) was a plus. ",5
" My wife had the fish and it was good. I had the cheese burger and was disappointed, certainly wasn't worth the price. Our waiter was great and the food arrived quickly. I think the beer was the only reason I would return and just for the beer. ",3
" Fault line is very good, but not great.  Ambience is nice.  It is a high-energy atmosphere. It looks like it would be good with a group. ",4
 This is our new go to place for business lunches.  The service is outstanding.  The food is very tasty no matter what the dish.  Kudos to the chefs!  TV's everywhere if you want to catch a sporting event... but they are not overly large.  So if you want to have conversation you can still hear the people at your table.  They are very efficient at taking orders and serving you.  Can't say enough about this place.  Salads are wonderful! ,5
 This was our first time to Faultline Brewing Company.  Thai chicken wings appetizer was delicious.  All the entrees were delicious.  We like that there is a  unique variety of items on the menu to choose from.  :D  This place is way above BJ's Brewhouse!    We will be back. ,4
" Great atmosphere, service was fabulous. Would definitely take a client again. ",5
" The special occasion was a good friends birthday. I wanted to go somewhere where we could talk and enjoy good food. I had the crab cake sandwich - absolutely delicious!  He had the fish and chips which were made perfectly. The view from the window seats made us feel like we were at a country club. I would recommend this for a special lunch, a business lunch and definitely to impress someone. The beer is made there and I tried the hefeweizen which was perfect with the crab. ",5
 Particularly  interested in the  music venue; Diminished Blue; Excellent Trio. Jack Raymond ,5
" It was great to be able to get a table without much wait. We were there for beer and appetizers. Awesome selection of beers, some in-house recipes, and appetizers are very yummy. ",4
 Awful service - waiter was just uneducated about the menu and made lots of mistakes. ,3
" Food was very spicy, not very tasty and service was really bad ",1
 They need to get it together.  The restaurant looks nice inside but doesn't make up for bad service. 1. Had reservations for 8pm was told couldn't be sat for 30 min cause kitchen was slammed yet restaurant wasn't busy 2. We had to complain at 8:40 cause still hadn't been sat 3. We never actually got a table we had to make them let us order at the lounge tables which doesn't make sense cause we could have done the same at a real table 4. Bartenders didn't know how to make the drinks we ordered and took over 15 min with only 4 others sitting at the bar so not busy 5. Food was ok but overpriced for the quality  6. They did nothing to compensate for the horrible experience  7. All staff seemed inexperienced and didn't know what was going 8. Only saw 3 cooks in the kitchen which is not effective for s restaurant that size 9. Top it off it was my bday and some of my guests had to leave early cause it took so long ,1
" The food was awesome!!!  Super Server.  Great place for big group to share lots of apps. Mains are delicious and have just the right amount of spice - not for the faint at heart if they say it's spicy, it it but so super tasty!! Enough choices for those who do not like spicy too. Fun cocktails, decent beer selection, and wine too. GREAT pre-Improv stop!!! HIGHLY Recommend. ",5
" I don't even know where to begin. I had a party of 12 for a birthday dinner. We stepped in and the ambience was actually really pleasant and really modern. However, once we got to our table, we did not expect to have such low seats and such a high table. It was awkward to eat and every one kept slipping out of their seats. The other half of the table sat on a couch that kept moving and sliding. The food came out staggered, and not by a few seconds or few minutes, straight up 6-10 minutes apart. The server, seemed new or just incompetent, forgot one of our dishes completely. The server ignored us most of the night so we had to walk up the bar to get our own drinks. The food was sub-par and just unsavory. I don't see myself coming back or any of my guests to come back at all. ",1
 Excellent food and service! I thought the hamburger was the best I ever had! ,5
" Overall very nice ambience, dining right at the Levi's stadium with a lot of parking (garage ramp across street, on non-game days of course, is literally empty). The energy builds up quick on a weekday evening, great for happy hour and dinner. ",4
" Spontaneous choice for an after-work meal. I elected to use my $50 OpenTable Dining reward together with a gift card my daughter had so we splurged on the menu and enjoyed the bourbon flight which introduced us to new flavors and personalized service. It was crowded and we were seated on bar-height stools at a tall table in the bar area right next to the pass so there was a lot of traffic but it wasn't too distracting. Overall, we had a very nice dinner together and plan to return. ",5
 Chimmichuri skirt steak was excellent as were the buffalo wings. The nitro stout was spectacular ,4
 The food was delicious however the service was slow ,4
" It’s a noisy bbq sports bar environment that smells like great bbq...except there’s literally no bbq on the menu...how???  We ordered tacos and the pork wasn’t tender or flavorful, def not slow smoked.   Overall it was one notch up from regular bar food, no desire to go back unless they develop a real bbq offering. ",3
" We ate on a Friday night, when there wasn’t an event at Levi’s Stadium.  (I suspect the place is very different on event days!) It was quiet, but they’d closed off the surplus space and it felt cozy. The menu is gourmet bar food, and is a good size: long enough so that you’ll find something you’ll like, small enough that they are likely to make every dish on it several times a night. We had a party of 5, and everything we ordered was cooked not just well but perfectly. Even the Mac and cheese from the kids menu was just right. ",5
" Our friends wanted to go there, I've been a couple of times, but the food is just average and so is the service. It's not terrible, it's just ok, so it's not a place I am excited to keep returning to, I end up going because someone else wants to check it out.  Great if you want to have a drink and watch sports on the TV's. ",3
" Bad service, signature cocktails were not good at all tried 3 different ones and food was mediocre been there several times and seems like declining every time. ",2
 Tator tots and Fish'n'Chips are BACK ON THE MENU!!!!  Best Pub food ever!! ,5
 Another amazing meal. The new chef has received the torch passed to him: The GREATEST LUNCH MENU IN Santa Clara!!!! A wonderful staff and second to none hand crafted cocktail list. (currently Sci-Fi themed) Pictured is the Nashville Hot Chicken Sammy. So good. ,5
" Always fabulous having dinner here with friends.  The wait staff are phenomenal, incredibly friendly, always make great suggestions, and help everyone have a great time!  Really appreciate this spot in Santa Clara. ",5
" pleasant servers, good banter and respectful distance when conversation was ongoing. some confusion on which table ordered the food and the side dish preference of salad vs fries was not what was served, got fries :( ",4
 Cool sports bar with great food located in Levi's stadium ,5
" Our waitress was MIA.  Had to ask everyone else for drink menu, please take our order. ",4
" Gold rush burger tasted different, still good, but was previously great. Chicken sandwich was good as well.  Service a little slow at bar, it was a newer person training- so was expected. Still a good experience overall. ",4
" Calling out Bourbon and their staff that day for really making better accommodations for me and my party.  I asked to be seated in the dining room (steakhouse side) because I was entertaining customers and we had business to discuss.  They happily obliged and set us up in the dining room and we were the only ones there.  Furthermore, they had about 3 different people checking in on us to make sure we were being taken care of.  Food was really good from appetizers to dessert and espresso.  Really helped give my customers a great experience and allowed us to focus on the tasks at hand. ",4
 Excellent restaurant and wonderful lunch. Really enjoyed the food and service. Very nice selection and burger was amazing. Special Paleo request no issue for chef. Thank you Bourban. ,5
 Outstanding cocktails.  This time I tried the steak sandwich and wasn't impressed.  Still my favorite place for a burger and cocktail ,5
" Order took 45 minutes to table. Requested 'rare' burger and even with generously low expectations received very well done. Others ordered medium and had at least some pink, this was thoroughly brown with no time to expect a reorder - our lunch ran way late as it was, had to inhale the food and rush out. ",3
 Great food.  We had a business lunch for 5 and everyone like the food and the relaxed atmosphere. ,5
" Surprised by the food and serve. Great overall service, hard to get these days. The drink and food were outstanding! ",5
 Love the table-side cut nachos and the staff (esp Chef) are amazing!! Great place to nosh some noms and drink after work :-) ,5
" Thank you for your excellent, attentive service!!  Yummy food and great beer!! ",5
" The best place to watch a game on this side of town. Not the cheapest, but the food is high quality. ",5
 Bring back the tots!!! Please please please bring back the tator tots!!!!!! ,4
" Always a great quality burger, good beer selection and quick service. ",4
 Definitely recommend their nachos! Most of their food is delicious and usually review 5 stars but unfortunately had a below average experience today.. Got the burger of the month (Breakfast burger) and ended biting down on a hard plastic piece.. they comp'd me a drink (I thought they comp'd the round but they charged us for the other two) but did not replace my food for which I ended up finding 2 more smaller pieces of the plastic in. Not the best experience for a favorite restaurant of mine.. can't all be great I guess right? All other times I've been here it's been great food and great service. ,3
 Great drinks! ,4
" Ordered the fish tacos... not bad, not the best on the menu in my opinion though. The nachos and pretzel apps are to-die-for though. Definitely recommend. ",5
" Nice place but a bit pricey, 3 large beers, 2 appetizers, 1 side of sweet pot fries was $98 before tip ",4
" OVERALL EXPERIENCE WAS GOOD. THE PLACE WAS PACKED. I LIKED THE COMPLIMENTARY VALET SERVICE. THE FOOD WAS FRESH BUT A BIT OVER PRICED- $85 FOR LUNCH FOR TWO (AND WE DID NOT GET ANYTHING SPECIAL) WAS DEFINITELY ON THE HIGH END. OTHER COMPARABLE PLACES IN THE AREA CAN FEED 2 FOR $40-50 RANGE. WOULD RECOMMEND, BUT NOT FOR A WEEKLY OUTING. MM ",5
 We came in to watch the NCAA championship game. It was perfect. If you like bourbon.. you can't go wrong. I would highly recommend to a friend ,5
 Food was good but way over priced. We paid $29 for a small skirt steak that came with a small salad. I was not full when I was done and I'm not a big eater..... ,3
" Menu online wasn't accurate, as they just switched over to a Spring menu.  As a vegetarian,  I have been to many steakhouses without issue.  There is usually at least a pasta on the menu to meet my needs.  Well there wasn't at Bourbon Pub.  Only apps and salads.  The chef ""created"" a veggie sandwich for me, but it was lackluster and void of flavor.  The garlic-parmesan tater tots were excellent and the best part of our meal.  The gentleman that poured my bourbon flight was excellent and the best example of proper customer service that you should expect at a Michael Mina restaurant.  I might go again for happy hour if a game I want to watch is on, but otherwise, I wouldn't return.  Sadly... ",2
 Great food. Super atmosphere. Best people! ,5
" I'd been coming here since the day after it opened. The Bourbon Steak serves excellent food and the Pub serves great food too. The service, unfortunately, has become horrible. The last two times I went to the Pub, we were seated at one of the tiny tables, which is fine for the two of us, but we ordered salads and dinner, which on two occasions, they brought at all at once, which we could barely fit on the table, let alone the basic idea that a salad is a course. The same happened with appetizers, except a 5 minute delay, when the waitress asked to take away the appetizer, which we had only just started eating. It seems like management changed and the service went to hell. ",3
" The Occasion was to mark a long time Co-worker leaving Sad to see him go, but to celebrate the years he was here Very good food selection Fantastic Bourbon / Whiskey list Atmosphere was great and the staff was outstanding ",5
 Wasn't aware that it was Trivia Night -  Very noisy. ,4
 Both Yeyson and Jerome were great. The tomahawk was flavorful and tender. Will go back soon! ,5
" We had reservations made a month before and reconfirmed the day before,  but when we arrived they didn't have a reservation for us or a table. So we had to wait  a long time until a table was available. So they probably shouldn't take reservations.  Once we were seated our food was good though. ",3
 The food seemed to be pre-prepared and warmed up microwaved for serving.  The beef pad-see-yew was clumpy and even the carrot and broccoli was limp.  The beef was scarce .  The pork barbecue was room temperature when served and was sautéed teriyaki pieces. - not a barbecue ,1
" always so good.  The staff is super friendly.  They welcome us with smiles and hellos.  We were promptly seated and served. We had fresh spring rolls, yum.  I followed that with Pumpkin curry, spicy and my husband had seafood basil. We were served plenty of rice with our meals and the food was tasty. Thai Bangkok is a favorite!! ",5
 I'm diabetic so in place of the rice that comes with lunch I was able to get steamed vegetables.  Excellent customer service.  The food is delicious as well.  I had the Panang curry with tofu and vegetables which came with a salad and soup. ,4
" I can't claim to be an expert on Thai cuisine, but we've been back several times and certainly enjoy Thai Bangkok's rendition. The staff is most helpful with individual suggestions and, more importantly, pairing suggestions. Helps bring a certain continuity to the dining experience. Soups are great, particularly if you like coconut milk and unique Thai herbs. Curries, as well as all other categories are quite flavorful. And you can order mild to spicy, but be ready for REALLY spicy if you get really insistent. They have additional spicy table condiments for which a tad bit of caution is suggested ... unless you do have a HIGH tolerance for heat. :-) ",5
" Excellent Thai food! Love the Red Curry dish. It's smooth, flavorful, and so good!! Thanks so much for the great meal! Looking forward to coming soon again. ",5
 Very nice place with good food and friendly staff. We visit this place about once every two weeks. ,5
 Friendly helpful staff. Offer suggestions if you are unsure of your selection. ,5
 Very friendly and personal staff. ,5
 Great food and friendly staff. ,4
 Great food!  Each of the dishes we ordered was so flavorful and delicious.  I will definitely come back.  Thumbs up! ,4
" Our 2nd time there and it was as good if not better than the 1st. We had a different server, but she was so accommodating and helpful with suggestions. We had the Papaya Salad (I added shrimp), Larb Fried Rice and Cucumber Salad. Salad was mildly spicy (spiced to your liking) and an excellent blend of sweet, salty, sour and spice. Our 1st time having Larb and the rice was not oily or ""loose"" like a typical fried rice, but in a dome that held together similar to a Japanese rice. Really good! The Cucumber salad is light and refreshing also. Lots of food, and more leftovers for later! Another winning meal! My new favorite restaurant! ",5
" Flavorful food.  Friendly staff who let us customize our order a little. Quiet, low key atmosphere.  Neighborhood gem ",4
" Our first time there. A wide variety of choices and interesting photos on their menu online so we gave it a try. We were pleasantly surprised. Delicious food and very nice servers. We had the pad thai with shrimp, a sweet and sour chicken and cucumber salad. Some Thai restaurants we've tried use a lot of oil and the food can get greasy, swimming in oil. Not here. All flavor without the grease. Can't wait to come back and try more dishes! ",4
 The staff was attentive and friendly. The food was flavorful &amp; well presented. We had: Roti Tom yum ka Drunken noodle Whole fried fish Pineapple fried rice Fried banana ice cream - so good! It was a good meal &amp; we'll definitely come back. ,4
 Very friendly staff and great food. ,5
 Very friendly server but the food was just so-so. The seafood dishes were laughing and made ingredient which is made up for by piles of vegetables. They were extras this extremely loud and making it hard to have a conversation. My first and last visit ,3
 Super authentic and delicious Thai food. Would definitely come back! ,5
 Food is very so so. ,3
" Pleasant ambiance, friendly staff, excellent food. ""A real find""! (this gem was not overcrowded onFridaynight) Would recommend highly. ",5
" Been to Thai Bangkok twice now. First time was very good -- had the satay and Pad Kee Mao, my standard test dish for any new Thai restaurant. Second time blew my mind! Had the Angry Seafood, which our server told me was their most popular dish. Best Thai meal I've ever had! Safe to say, this is my new go-to Thai spot. ",5
 A great neighborhood find. Dined midweek for dinner: very quiet with excellent service. The restaurant was extremely clean and service was attentive. Would return again. ,4
" We ordered a variety of dishes. All portions were very generous. However, most dishes were disappointing. The pad thai was dry. The mango seafood was tasteless. The one spicy dish we tried was blistering hot and barely edible.  Barbecue chicken had a strange yellow seasoning. Thai fried rice was very good.   The service was also very good, there is nothing to compel us to return. ",3
" We visited once, loved the restaurant. Second visit, two weeks later, they recognized us (shows a real commitment to service) and were very happy to see us. The restaurant is in a little strip mall on Stevens Creek just off 85, so very convenient. Easy parking in back. Nicely set up inside, our visits had several groups there but it was still quiet. Interior is very clean, nicely decorated, very enjoyable. The menu is extensive, and we can't say we have tried a lot, as we ordered the same dishes the second visit because we loved them so much the first time. Our dishes were very well made, quality ingredients, and a great selection (be careful, though!) of spicy condiments on the table. We will be back many times. The restaurant is ready to celebrate its first anniversary, and while I hate to lose a quiet place that is easy to get into and inexpensive, these folks deserve great success, so, please enjoy. ",5
 This is great food at a reasonable price with Happy service! ,5
 Best Thai food in the area. Best value for money.  Service and food were great... Our new family favorite ,5
" Great taste, plentiful portions, good ambiance, and lots of fun.  We took a lunch group of 14 with 30 minute notice . They accommodated us with no problem. (We will give more notice next time). ",5
" There was a bit of a wait but to be expected given how there was not a single empty table, good food and a responsive waitress helped ease the wait ",4
 Thai Bangkok cuisine has excellent quality food but some dishes seemed on the sweet side oddly. The Tom Yum soup in particular was kind of sweet and not as sour as I have seen in other restaurants. Quantity was a bit on the smaller side for dishes so it didn't leave me too full. Service was excellent! The waitresses here are all very friendly and hope you have a pleasant experience. I would recommend the 53 noodle dish and the roti for sure as items to have in your meal. ,3
" The appetizers could have used a little more flavor, but the entrees &amp; soup were excellent.   The service was also fantastic.  It is a place I would love to go to again and keep tasting other items on their menu. ",5
 Cozy neighborhood Thai restaurant. Service was excellent and we had a great time bantering with our server.   The food was wonderful and fresh. Everyone at our table was pleased with the food and the neighborhood dining experience. ,4
" This was our second time dining at Bourbon Steak and again the food and service were outstanding. The prix fixe menu was in transition, but the chef accommodated us and we had the wine pairing as well. Every course was delicious. Each dish was a unique combination of flavors and textures. I'm looking forward to the bourbon tasting on my next visit. ",5
 Great food. Above average service. Note they have separate reservation systems for the dining room and the bar. ,5
" Went there with business colleagues for an early dinner on a weeknight.  The large bar was pretty full.  The restaurant is nicely separated from the bar keeping the noise level down substantially.  The piped-in music was a little bit loud for my taste but not so much that  it hindered conversation.     The menu is typical ""steakhouse;""  our meals (salads, steaks, and a couple of sides) were quite good but not outstanding as steakhouses go.  I would recommend for special occasions where ""special occasion"" = ""game day.""  A no brainer  if (1) you're looking for a sit down meal at Levi's stadium as part of your game day experience and (2) you like steakhouses. ",4
" We went to the Bourbon Steak House side of the restaurant on a Wednesday night. The Bistro side was standing room only and although we were there slightly ahead of our reservation time, they didn't seat us until 10 minutes after our reservation.  I think a lot of people dine here early as a lot of table left around 9.  The food is the star here with the service providing a solid backing.  We had 2 starters (both recommended by our server), the burrata and the tuna tartare.  Before we go the starters we were served a warm, buttery, salty brioche and 3 sets of flavored French fries with accompanying dips.  The fries were enough of a starter (especially the chedder-jalapeno flavored ones) which didn't help with us finishing our ordered starters.  We then had the beet salad (very well prepared and tasty) and the wedge salad (cut across the lettuce head instead of as a true ""wedge"").  Finished those off without a hitch.  Main courses were the black sea bass (buttery and smooth with pancetta and white beans); filet mignon (char-broiled and very rare which kept it moist and tender). Also had the sides of mac and cheese, wild mushrooms (the best side) and gnocchi which were huge. Overall a great meal (and the cost was along the lines of a very upscale restaurant). Setting was nice, much quieter than the Bistro side with lots of old photos of the 49ers.  Would go back if I had a special occasion or an expense account.  Service was top notch and our server knew everything about the menu and made great recommendations (although he couldn't remember the name of the place were they get their micro-greens, small matter though). ",5
" Been here before several times and would definitely recommend the pub side.  The steakhouse side no thanks, went with a group and we all spent more time having to argue with the waitress over what a medium to well done steak is and the ""BOURSTEAKTERMOLOGY"" of what temperature we would like our steak cooked.  Just cooked would be nice folks!!!  What we all received was cold to mildly warm steaks undercooked.  If we'd wanted poor cuts of meat uncooked we...well what more can you say?   Save your money and patience as there's far better places in Bay than this place. ",2
" we thought the food would be great and it would have been, had it been out 20 minutes before it did and had it been hot. the service was slow and i mean slow.... it wasn't even a busy night so i'm not sure how it is when it's busy.  we ordered filet and rib eye...and it was delicious. only thing wrong with it was that it came out warm, not hot. it was cold in 10 minutes. all the other food we got was really good. truffled mac and cheese was really good and i'm not a fan of brussels sprouts, but theirs was amazing. the fries and truffled sweet bread was to die for. so really, other than the service and warm steak, i would've given this a higher score...but unfortunately, that's what matters the most. ",3
" The service is one of the best we've experienced.  Although the ambiance is very good, a view of the stadium would add so much.  The food is very good and the selection of steaks (our favorite food when dining out) is excellent.  We thought the noise level was going to be overwhelming in the restaurant since the entrance is through the bar area however, once you reach the restaurant, the noise level is next to nothing which made us very happy as we brought another couple.  We could hear each other with no probelm whatsoever. I can't remember the name of the appetizer at the moment, but it's a rabbit dish that is a must! And, oh yea, the fries, yes the fries, with the three sauces - excellent! ",4
" This restaurant is not up my expectations compared to other Michael Mina's restaurants that I've been. My main server wasn't that friendly, but those who brought food out. ",2
" Went based on a friends recommendation and being a big steakhouse guy it seemed like a good call. all was going well, the service was great, the place is nice but in the end, my ribeye was cooked wrong and had some strips of fat in it that made some of it it inedible. That shouldn't happen when 5 guys go out to a steakhouse and drop $1200 ",2
" If I had read the reviews first, I would still have gone to this restaurant.  Unfortunately, our experience was not a great one.  We were celebrating a birthday and wanted the novelty of eating at an upscale steakhouse at Levi's Stadium.  I commented on the OpenTable reservation that this was a birthday celebration and who it was for.  There was a birthday card waiting at our table handwritten by the staff.  Very nice touch!  At the end of the meal, they delivered a nice tray with treats and a birthday greeting written in chocolate.  Another nice touch!  Our total bill for our party of 4 was $350 including a $50 tip.  We had no alcoholic beverages; only food.    We had 3 bone-in rib-eyes ($57 ea.) and 1 filet mignon ($49).  We ordered the steaks medium, but the filet and 1 rib-eye had to be sent back for further cooking.  It took a while to get the steaks in the first place, then additional time to get them back.  I expect a high-end steak house, which has limited cuts to choose from, to have perfected their skill in cooking those particular cuts, so I think 2 out of 4 is not good.  The manager brought the two steaks back out to the table and asked us to cut into them to make sure they were cooked right.  He apologized for under cooking them.  I wish they would have asked us to cut into them when they first delivered them and shined a flashlight on them, like some steakhouses do, but they didn't.  The sides ($10) were single portion.  At other high-end restaurants, the sides are large enough to share.  It was dark in the restaurant.  I had to ask for salt for the table.  I couldn't see it when sprinkling it on my steak, so I had to sprinkle it on my hand to check how much was coming out.  Duck fat fries were brought to the table before the meal, but were not on the menu as an available side item.  They were great!  I wish they were an option for a side. ",3
 Was not impressed with the special Valentine Days menu.  It was a small portion samples of some of their dishes.  However the steak sample was delicious.  I would come back to try their steak in full size portions!  😄 ,3
" Our first time there, we Double dated and we did'nt want to dissapointe the other couple. Well they were not, they were so thankfull we took them there, and to have it attached to to Levi's stadium was awsome. From the valet drivers to the buss boys, were friendly and polite. we will recomend this place to everyone...Thank You.... ",5
" Our son gave us a gift card after a great pub experience. We took the stadium tour, had a drink in the pub and had a lovely early valentine celebration. My wife needed gluten sensitivity help that with prodding they steered us through the menu. An ongoing special of half off all bottles of wine allowed us to experiment and with the Som's help found a great champange.  The MM duck fat fries, the frog legs pasta, the diver scallop risotto and my wife's rib cap steak with loaded potato and broccoli were all flavor experiences to remember.  The bill was high, but appropriate for a MM high end steak place that turns our foodie quality dishes. For a special occasions, it will be on the list. (I would do unspeakable things to have another order of the flavored duck fat fries - We did also discover that the complimentary fries have a light coating of flour making them enemies of the gluten sensitive and all mine) ",4
" We chose it for a business dinner bc of its location which added ""interest"" for an out of town customer. However, compared to other top priced steakhouses I didn't feel this met the mark, given the pricing. A good benchmark is Birk's which has served consistently flawless steaks for a couple of decades.   Decor is modern and tasteful. Noise level was reasonable. As is common these days, the menu has the regular steak selection at around the $50 mark, but is padded with super expensive choices with exotic beef cuts ($34 per ounce was the top end).  In the end these came out pretty black and indistinguishable, certainly not worth the extra 60-100% in cost. One medium rare was medium, and vice versa for another.   The rest of the menu was below average given the high end. Very average and half empty sea food platter for $42. Plates of French Fries as a complementary ""amuse-bouche"" - that's a first! Deserts were strange. Service was very slow.   I think this place will continue just fine based on it's location, but I'll stick with Birk's or Lion and Compass next time. ",4
" First time visiting Bourbon Steak.  The restaurant shares its entrance with Bourbon Pub, which makes it confusing to check in.  Ordered the Braised Short RIb, the Hanger Steak, and sides of broccoli and gnocchi.  Also tried the complimentary duck fat fries, which were delicious!  Our server stated the sides were large enough to share.  Portions were actually small for the price, a little bland and nothing special.  The short ribs and steak were tasty, though, which slightly makes up for it.  Service was OK.  There was a large party sitting at a table next to us, raising the noise level in the restaurant. ",3
 Most horrible restaurant in san jose. Not only was food horrible their service was even worse. We didn’t like anything there but for their ambience. ,1
" we went here to celebrate birthdays and there was one vegetarian in our party.  we requested if the chef can make something else other than the broccoli dish they had on the menu and was told they can make pasta with butter...this is not a kid.  expected more from Michael Mina restaurant.  they settled for the item on the menu. it was horrible tasting.  to top this off, the server decided that there was a bigger tip with large party that just sat and totally lost focus on servicing our table.  overall, i would not recommend this place especially if you have a vegetarian in your party.  most steak restaurant do accommodate vegetarian but not here. ",3
" This is a definite recommend and we will return for a special occasion.  Wedged just a bit too inconspicuously in a corner of Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Bourbon Steak is a great addition to the fancy restaurant scene in Silicon Valley.   Signature Lobster Pot Pie is entertaining and tasty: a generous tail and multiple claws reconstructed tableside out of a copper saucepan.  The impeccably butchered New York Strip was very flavorful and perfectly charred on the outside while a perfect medium rare on the inside.  A beet salad, Caesar salad (with a saba dressing--a positive innovation to the almost perfect traditional recipe) and a roasted broccoli romanesco were up to the challenge of complementing the main events.  Wine list was extensive and professionally sold. (the night we visited was a half-off promotion on all bottles, a great opportunity to wander out of the kiddie pool and have something special).  All service was excellent--timely, friendly, unobtrusive.  Tiny quibbles: no coat room so raincoat (first storm in the area since Noah!) spent evening in a neat pile next to hostess podium; chair seats were a bit too shallow front to back and hit me a bit short of mid-thigh; access through a very loud bar/grill area. ",5
" The food overall was pretty good, but the quality was not worth the price paid.  I tried the Wagyu rib cap and the flavor and preparation was tasty, but it was chewy.  Isn't Wagyu supposed to be tender?  I had rib cap in Las Vegas and it melted in my mouth, and I expected this $89 a la carte meat to be outstanding, but it was more like a $30 NY steak. ",4
" This is a fantastic Resteraunt in a great location.  I am a die hard steak junkie and haven't been impressed with Morton's or Ruth's Chris for a while.  This place had the best steak I have ever tasted!  Perfect meat cooked to absolute perfection.  Friendly staff, great apps...overall just an amazing experience ",5
" Terrible steaks (ouch) - dry aged ribeye did not taste dry aged to me  Mac and cheese was runny and odd tasting (truffles left odd taste, and I love truffles)   Brussels sprouts sadly were the highlight of the meal  Service was not on par for the price, very ackward wait person  I suggest they have some work to do... ",1
" Went for a intimate birthday celebration and enjoyed it. A bit pricy but given the results we both said ""yes we would do it again"".  We couldn't get their wine list to come up on line so we brought our own. The whiskey sour was Devine, the appetizers great and both dinner and dessert send us home full and happy. Good recommendations by the waiter too. We will be back. ",5
" Celebrates my wonderful husband's birthday. Advised the ahead of time of the special occasion. They had a booth prepared for us upon arrival &amp; there was a birthday card with signatures of the staff that night. It was really a nice touch.   Staff was attentive and helpful. They explained each dish as it was being presented. &amp; they were all helpful to each other. I love seeing that. Totally forgot our servers name, but he was very patient &amp; helpful when it came to the menu. I appreciate honest opinions, &amp; I everything he recommended was delicious.  Food was outstanding. We're regulars at Arcadia, so we're familiar with Michael Mina &amp; his duck fat fries, which are to die for. The only thing we we didn't like was that they changed the menu from broccoli &amp; cheddar to roasted romanesco broccoli. We weren't too big of fans of that dish, everything else was great and well prepared. ",5
 Great service.  Good place for a business diner.  Perfectly presented food with a variety of well matched tastes.  The restaurant is quiet and the bar is loud.  As it should be. ,4
" Took the Mrs. to Bourbon Steak for our anniversary. Booked via OpenTable. In their online reservation form, they asked about special requests. Half-jokingly, half-seriously, I ordered a miniature T-Rex to greet us at the table. (Long story short, we joke and call the Mrs. ""T-Rex"" because she's got short arms and usually needs someone else to grab stuff off shelves for her.) I figured they'd get a picture of a T-Rex and place it on the table if they were to indulge us.  Nope.  The crew at Bourbon Steak actually put a Rex (from Disney's ""Toy Story"") on our table. Given we're big ol' Disney fans, that was nothing short of awesome. The fact they debated how to face it when we arrived showed how much they cared about the little details. Impressive.  The staff was very courteous and made us feel at home. They were attentive without being intrusive. That's important.  And the grub, oh my...  The french fry flight is the greatest appetizer in the history of ever. Duck fat fries, jalapeño cheddar fries and malt vinegar fries with bacon/pickled ketchup; crème fraîche with chives; and caper aioli dipping sauces respectively. I'd go back for that alone.  The steaks hit the taste buds in the right spots. I had the filet mignon and she had the US Wagyu rib cap. I can see what the hype is about wagyu. It lived up to it. (The only minor knock was a certain cut we wanted was out of stock. Boo. But it all worked out, taste-wise.)  Truffle mac &amp; cheese was the best mac &amp; cheese I ever had and I loves me my mac. Perfect balance of texture betwen the gooey cheesy with the salty/savory.  Anyway, I'm being pedantic here. Bottom line: Love steak? Wanna' impress someone? Wanna' be impressed with an awesome experience? Go to Bourbon Steak. Their overall product is as impressive as Jerry Rice's 1987 season. ",5
 Worst food &amp; restaurant very rude waitress as well will never visit again what a waste of time &amp; money ,1
" One of the worst dining experiences I’ve had. We were met promptly and seated right away. That was the highlight of the evening. Our waitress was in way over her head. She obviously hadn’t received any training. My wife ordered a “Tito’s rocks” to which she replied “Is that on the menu?” The rest of us ordered a bottle of red wine with three glasses. After a long wait, my wife’s drink arrived along with a glass of wine. We re-iterated our order and our waitress showed up awhile with the bottle which she said “They just opened” and three glasses. She placed them on the table.   The food was one dimensional. The Tom Yum soup was spicy but the lemongrass was nonexistent and there were scant few chunks of chicken. The beef in the Pot dinner was chewy and over cooked and again the dish had no depth of flavor.   Don’t get me started on the bathroom. ",1
" The food was okay: crab cakes (average), Nonya Sambal Prawns (only four prawns, lot of sauce), and vegetable yellow curry (meh). One of our cocktails was made incorrectly. The service was substandard, particularly since they were busy and only had two servers. We had passed by and thought we should stop in and try it once. We did, and we will continue to pass by. ",2
 Avoid at any cost. Very disappointed in the service for a business meal with a new team of colleagues. ,1
" We chose this spot for a pre-concert dinner using our $10-off coupon from the Symphony. Reservations were for 6:30pm on a Saturday night, and we arrived at 6:20 to find the restaurant mostly empty. We were graciously allowed to split one of their Prix Fixe dinners, which include appetizer, salad, entree, and dessert. The mango-papya salad was good but too spicy for us. The eggplant fries were great, with a sweet chili sauce. The Butter Chicken entree was the best thing we had, with rice and great nan and lentils. Our dessert, mango mousse, was excellent, but with little mango flavor to it. The pacing of the meal was a little spotty. The salad and appetizer arrived at our table simultaneously, and there was a little too much time between courses, particularly for a mostly empty restaurant. All-in-all a positive experience, however. ",3
" Having been to most All Steak Houses in Silicon Valley I feel as I have tasted the best of the best. Michael Mina's Bourbon Steakhouse has now become my personal favorite for more than one reason.  Ordered the Domestic Wagyu  Rib Cap, WOW what a treat !!!!  If you have never tried Wagyu beef this is the place to go. The flavor is equal to any Japanese Wagyu I have ever tasted and when you mix that with the way it just melts in your mouth......Your in for a true experience.  We were truly gifted to have Max as our server and found that together with his teammates they truly make you feel like royalty. Experienced the Bourbon Flight,(don't miss it), and I am speechless on the taste of the French Fry Appetizer, nothing as it sounds.  You have to try them. All and all you are headed for a great experience if your decision is to dine at Bourbon Steak House.  Congratulations Michael Mina, you have done it again.   Thanks for bringing world class dining to Silicon Valley. ",5
 We came to celebrate our son's 28th birthday - and everyone wished him a happy birthday. The waiter was very helpful and informative. The sommelier was nice and was skilled at getting the broken cork out of the wine bottle that we brought. The food was outstanding - everything was cooked perfect. The steaks were perfect. Everything was perfect. We will be coming again! ,5
" Excellent food, service, atmosphere and wine. Treat yourself to something special. Put this on your bucket list of restaurants. You will not be disappointed. ",5
 We spent the New Years eve here... Everything was awesome n excellent... Well done from food to service... Beautiful surrounding n we did enjoy it much...! ,5
 This was our first visit to a Michael Mina restaurant.  Was not disappointed.  From the complimentary duck fat fries to the entree and dessert this place knows how to cook food. I had one of the best filet mignons ever. We also had the brussel sprouts and trio of potato purees - all tasty. For dessert we had beignets and a dark chocolate torte. One of the best meals in the Bay Area. ,5
" All of us (4) had red meat...Strip Steak, Hanger Steak, and Filet were all excellent.  Steaks all done to the perfect temperature and were very savory. Our fourth had the short ribs and was very pleased with the flavor.   The mushroom and mac and cheese were the two sides that we shared.  They were both good with the mac and cheese being a little better.  I started off with the beet salad.  It was very good and the presentation was outstanding. The ""Bourbon Flight"" was educational and the three bourbons that my son and I shared (only enough for a small taste) was good.  The Manager did the presentation and it was very well done. My wife ordered a lime (?) fizz and it was not up to standards but everything else was done very well. Our waitress was outstanding and the service staff as a whole were great, especially considering it was Christmas eve. ",4
" Great food, great service.  Most annoying parking policy ever: you only get two hours of parking at a discount and must pay more if you are more than 2 hours, regardless of how long you wait or how much you order.  Valet also fills up and is closed to new diners. ",5
 With a name like Bourbon Steak you have got to try a steak. And I'm sure every steak on the menu is as good as the one we had... the arctic char was a perfect complement! Running into 49ers running backs was an added bonus :) ,5
 I expected that the restaurant would have a view of the stadium. It could be across the street and have a view of the stadium. That was the only disappointing part.  The food was great. The service was great. The bar was great. Highly recommend--just had a different expectation of view. ,5
 I love the sophisticated dining experience. I definitely would return to try more dishes.  Everyone loved the filet mignon steak. Service was well-timed and friendly. Surprized at the wine-list with several cult wines. ,5

Brian our waiter was attentive and was ready whenever we needed anything.  Jenson or busboy was Johnny on the spot with little delightful specials from the kitchen for us to savior before our meals and clearing away the empties.  The French fries with the three dips were to die for and the truffle buns; there are not words to describe how wonderful they were.    There were four of us so we each picked a meat entrée, Filet, Sirloin, Flank Steak and Skit Steak Wagyu.  Every bite melted in our mouth.  The Sirloin tasted like filet, no joke, it was awesome.  The Polenta was smooth and rich, creamy spinach was wonderful and the broccoli and cheddar sauce was perfect with the meal.  For starters the oysters and beet salad are a must.  The oysters were fresh and savory and the beet salad was just delightful.   The wine sommelier Adam came over and poured our wine, which we had brought;  we asked him to join us in a glass and he was gracious enough to do so and pay for our corkage fee.  He later came over and discussed the ports and poured us a wonderful sparkling wine that finished out our terrific meal.   Since there were four of us we picked one of each.  Not that we had room but who could resist the Persimmon pana cotta, Brown butter apple crisp, chocolate malted milk torte or my favorite the macallan 12 butterscotch custard with warm beignets  OH MY WORD, do save room for one or all of these if you are in a group, they are beyond tasty.  I could go on and on as you can tell, but I think you get the picture. Awesome mean, great staff and perfect way to spend an evening with friends, family or significant other. ",5
" Michael Mina's new restaurant is fantastic.  It's located on the new 49ers stadium lot and has a vibrant bar section with a multitude of flat panels to view all the sports you want.  The restaurant is energetic and an open room format.  The menu is not overly complicated and is filled with great selections from the basic food groups.  The steak selections are typical cuts high-end steak houses offer.  The meat is excellent, well aged and flavorful.  All dishes are seasoned well, I noticed and appreciated salt and pepper are not on the table and are not needed.  During dinner the chef sent some special treats which really complimented the dinner.  Overall, it was a great dining experience that is highly recommended for a special event or for a special night out. ",5
" Having dined at Michael Mina's other restaurants in Las Vegas and San Francisco, I expected at least an equal fine dining experience. What a disappointment! First, I booked this restaurant to celebrate our wedding anniversary and as a gift to my husband who is a loyal 49ers' fan. I knew the venue would be at a football stadium, but I thought the restaurant itself would be posh. The interior of the restaurant is a smaller version of a convention banquet room with television monitors in place of artwork. Even the light fixtures looked to be from some motel lobby. Second, the service was not topnotch. The hostesses did not seem to care that we wanted to learn about the interesting aspects of the restaurant (the giant rotisserie, the lobster pots, the open kitchen) and instead directed us to the stadium store when we arrived early for our reservation. The store was closed, by the way. Our waiter was not friendly and although we were the first patrons in the restaurant on a Sunday evening, he seemed rushed and disinterested in making us feel welcome. He seemed more interested in selling us a bottle of wine or cocktails rather than explaining the menu. Once our orders were taken, the food service was conducted by several young men including one server with a heavy Hispanic accent who rushed through his descriptions of the amuse bouche (French fries with three dipping sauces which we never clearly understood what they were!) and our starters and entrées. Whoever is training this staff ought to caution them about rushing through such descriptions and hurrying guests through their meal. Finally, the food itself was mediocre at best. The starters such as the beet salad and the lobster ravioli were tasty but not special, even with a $20.00 shaving of white truffles. And, since this is a steak house, my keenest disappointment was my ribeye steak which was one of the most meager cuts of fatty, gristly steak I have ever tasted in a restaurant. We will not return. ",2
" The Bourbon Steak is adjacent to the Bourbon Pub which shares the same entrance at Levi's stadium.  So you have to walk through the sports bar to get yo the formal restaurant section. The service and food was excellent.  They have a variety of beef cuts and grades from Prime, Wagyu, and a sold by the ounce Japanese grade steak.   They also had on this night, Moroccan chicken and duck breast in addition to lobster and other seafood fare.  The dinner starts Out with a French fry sampler accompamied with 3 dipping sauces and a roll basted with melted truffle butter.  Nice touch.  Overall a very satisfying experience for a special dinner.  Not too formal, but quality food. FYI, Valet is $15 if you stay over 2 hours, otherwise it's 8. ",5
 We had a great dinner in the dinning room.  Service was impeccable and the General Manager was very gracious with his service checking on all the details.  The waitress and her team did not mid a beat.  The only objective comment I would make is the music is very loud.  Overall great place with Mina quality food. ,5
" Excellent drinks, amazing fries and ""secret bread"", and a very good waiter, but the steak did not come out hot. and for a $59 steak, with a final bill between two people running over $300, not having a cooked perfectly just wasn't good enough. ",3
 Many dishes were spicy.  The seafood (calamari and sea bass) was very delicious and prepared so expertly!  Our waiter was attentive and service was very good.  Dishes are pricy and portions are small. ,4
" We enjoyed the food and ambience. The Chinese styled food was great, Indian cuisine could have been better and dishes like quail  was a big no-no. Overall , we had an excellent and a memorable evening. ",4
 The food was excellent.  The service was great. I always enjoy dining at this restaurant. I highly recommend it. ,5
" One of the worst restaurants. It was practically empty, but the appetizers took 40mins to get to us (and they weren't great). We'd been there about an hour, and we still hadn't been served our main meal. We kept being told it was almost ready, nothing ever came. On top of this, the ambiance was awful and there was horrible, loud repetitive techno-music in the background. They never even gave us napkins.  All restaurants in that area were busy expect this one. It should have told us something. ",1
 The techno music was way too loud for the small amount of people in the restaurant (most of the restaurant was empty). The wait staff was very slow and the food took over an hour to come out and when it did finally come out it was cold. I would not suggest this restaurant for more than a drink when you have no time constraints. ,1
" Our visit to M was very disappointing. We arrived early, telling the hostess that we had reservations. The place was huge, but nearly empty and loud rap music was playing from the food preparation area, not exactly what you would expect the ambience to be in a Asian fusion restaurant. She failed to log our arrival to OpenTable. The waiter informed us that it was happy hour and drinks were discounted. Then after we ordered our drinks the waiter returned to inform us that these drinks were not available at the happy hour prices, only select drinks. So we ordered from the happy hour list, some which seemed very unusual. We enjoy trying new items, but the drinks tasted like perfume, not appealing. My wife asked for something else and the bar tender (the manager) made her another smaller drink that was not much better. After ordering our appetizers (just salad and soup),  we waited and waited and could not locate our waiter. I went to the bar and asked why we were still waiting. She rolled her eyes and asked, ""Was your waiter Mario?"" Our appetizers subsequently arrived, then our entrees and desserts. The food was OK, but not that special, so disappointing. The manager came over later and apologized saying something about being short-staffed. We wondered how much staff it take to serve two tables? ",1
 Excellent service. Very responsive staff. Nice atmosphere.  Food is very good. Great value. ,4
 Food was excellent. Server was new and did an amazing job. Have eaten there many times and it is always excellent.  I will definitely return. ,5
 The only problem was how long it took for the bill to come to us. ,3
" I chose this place because of the relaxing quiet atmosphere, but upon being seated the while restaurant turned into a Bollywood Nightclub with really loud music. We could not have a conversation. The service from out waiter Edgar was excellent. ",2
 Excellent food and outstanding service.  Great atmosphere.  Staff is terrific. ,5
" The restaurant's decor is dramatic and beautiful.  Yet, the lunch buffet was very bad with very few selections and food that had been sitting around for too long and tasted old, limp, and stale.  If they can hire someone who actually can cook, they would be a great success. What a shame since the space is so nicely decorated. ",3
 Inconsistent in food and service ranging from ok to send back. They are working on the problem with a smaller menu and trying to get it right. ,2
" Ambiance is very good, food quality is nice too. Service is a bit slow though. People are very friendly. ",4
" Terrible service, terrible food ",1
 Really disappointed with the experience here.  Had a 7:00 reservation and did not get seated until 7:25.  The insult to injury was a table of 4 that came in behind us that got seated right away.  Service was completely unattentive.  When all was said and done we had completed our meal at 10:00.  I'm not sure if they had a bad night but I could never go back here. ,3
" We had a lovely dinner, a little pricey but worth the extra just to have the naan. We started with drinks from the bar, the thai chili margarita is spicy hot, but didn't skimp on the tequila. Since it was Valentines day we tried the Prix Fix menu and we were not disappointed.  I had the butter chicken and my husband the prawns. The star of the night was the naan.  - Enjoyed my evening and the service was good and the food was good as well. ",4
 It was fun but the noise kind of made it hard to enjoy my date. Use the groupon. ,3
 Food was quite good and creative. But the drink my wife received was nothing like what she ordered.  It took a long time for anyone to take our food order.  However once the waiter came he was very helpful and the food came quickly. ,3
 New Year's Eve menu and decor was spot on and very classy. The vegan options were delicious! Every staff member was professional. ,5
" AVOID!!!! Bizarre and AWEFUL experience...Hostess was rude beyond belief and Didn't want to honor the reservations  saying they were understaffed. We had a group of 7 and I had baby In my arms while she yelled at me for not calling prior to coming in.... excuse me? Isn't the whole point of OpenTable reservations so that u don't have to call? She then basically threw us out of the restaurant. It was Saturday night, freezing, and needless to say every other restaurant was packed.. thank you chachos for taking us in. We had a lovely time. Good and service we're great. ",1
 Our food was tasty but it was also cold which made the meal not worth eating. ,3
" Went for Birthday Dinner. Food was excellent.  Great value. Service was amazing. Servers were friendly, responsive,   and outstanding. I highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely return. ",5
 Lunch time buffet; the food was not excellent nor bad. But the amount was scarce and we had to scrape the bottom of the dish each time new food came out. It seemed as though we had to beg to get food replenished. ,3
 Great menu options and service was excellent. Happy hour specials were a great value. ,5
 If they can get their staff to bring out serving utensils and come back to the table in a normal frequency this could be a very good restaurant. But the waitstaff is missing the maitre d is missing and it's hard to get service even trying to wave them down. ,3
 worst dinner..cold and very bad soup and dining.I came in with a groupon coupon and the food was the worst. I have been there earlier and I liked it on my last visit but this time seriously the food was aweful! Not sure if you treat your groupon customers this way! The soup was cold and the wrost. same with other food. Satay chicken wasnt cooked properly. ,1
" Took us 10 minutes to get seated (place was empty), 15 minutes to get someone to our table, another 10 minutes to get our drink order, 15 minutes to get our drinks, 20 minutes before server came back to check on us to take our order...at which point we asked for our check and left.  There were plenty of workers there and hardly any patrons.  Horrible service.  F+ ",1
 I have been here 3-4 times anD i love it . It's great or families and or large gatherings. The dance floor is amazing. ,5
" Great service, made a reservation but it was pretty empty so didn't need it. Great happy hour values! ",4
 The buffet was delicious and catered to vegetarians also. ,4
" The ambience was good, the decor and lighting. Food was sub par and the wait for food after th order was placed was longggg even though the restaurant was just around 50% full. ",2
" Went for Restaurant Week promotion, but was really underwhelmed by the loud music and less-than-consistent service. The waitstaff was either all over us or completely unavailable. Food was OK, but heavy on its use of red onions. Not sure if it was worth it for the prix fixe meal. ",2
" The spicy fried rice was the best I have had in the bay area. Make sure you can handle a bit of soice though. Green curry, gobi manchurian and paneer tikka were on point. The vegetable pot meal was below par or lacked flavor. Service was great. ",5
 Too many people serving the table obviously not communicating very well. timing of delivery of drinks and food was off. waiter arguing with customer is a no no. will not return ,2
" The service was wonderful, the food was enjoyed by all and the atmosphere was wonderful.  The foie gras butter is a must! ",5
 My husband and I celebrated our anniversary at the Bourbon Steak House and had an amazing experience. The staff went above and beyond to help us celebrate. They gave us a hand written note signed by all of the staff congratulating us and thanking us for spending our special night with them. They even brought us a complementary appetizer and drink to end the night. For anyone who likes bourbon you have to try the bourbon flight where a knowledgeable staff member smokes different items at the table to infuse a taste/smell into your glass.  We will definitely be returning! ,5
 Food and sevice were great ,4
 The personnel were very knowledgeable and kind. ,4
" Food was yummy, steak amazingly cooked to perfection and beautifully seasoned.  Service stunk!!!  Our waiter in training?  Great gal that was putting him through the paces, could see she is on her game, could see why they would want her training staff.  But really...it took them far to long to show us any attention, only one check back, always having to use bus staff to get their attention.  They were having a huge problem at the bar.  Waited 35+ mins. for my single $17 cocktail.  We had brought our own wine, had it uncorked immediately.  Ended up starting the wine and waved off the drink when it finally came around with the Manager and about 15 other drinks on his tray.  Offered no apology, just moved on. Overall the service of the waitstaff was so underwhelming for the price point of restaurant &amp; food it really negated the overall dining experience for me even though the food was good. The drink didn't show up on the bill, but usually  in upper scale establishments (and just some restaurants that value their customers), the mgr comes around...offers apology or at very least waiters offer free coffee or a dessert to acknowledge the bad service received.  There are plenty of high end restaurants will make me feel good spending $600 for dinner (could have been more if I had cocktails, especially at $17 each!).  This is not one of them. ",2
" We had the most delightful evening you could ask for last weekend at this place.  We sat at the bar, which I highly recommend---you can order off of either the Bar menu or the Restaurant menu.  The bartenders are real pros, and the craft cocktails are delightful---original, delicious, creative, seasonal.  The salmon crudo and pork belly appetizers were perfect, and the ribeye steak we split was the best steak I've had in the South Bay in a long time---maybe ever.  The sommelier was really knowledgeable, and recommended a really unusual wine for our meal that we never would have found on our own and ended up really, really enjoying.  We will be back, many times I hope. ",5
" Had a late reservation for 4 on a Wednesday night. Server greeted us very nonchalantly, took our order, forgot our drinks, and never saw him again. Food started coming out and apps were fine.  The only bad taste I left with was the terrible service, or lack thereof. The original server never came back. The food runners/bussers were the only ones to check on us and apparently they switched servers ( since the first one was annoyed we came in late ) but did not see him till we were almost finished with our entrees. Why have reservations available if your servers are going to treat us so poorly? The only pleasant thing was the food runners/bussers asking how things were occasionally. In any case, the whole experience fell so short from any dining expectations, especially of a Michael Mina establishment. Will I be back or recommend this place? Thanks, but no thanks. ",1
 Had a great dinner. Service was good. Enjoyed the teres major steak and the truffle Mac was to die for. Ended the eve with the binets which was a great choice. Overall had a great experience. ,5
" The restaurant is broken into a bar/food area and steakhouse..  The bar area is nice and prices seemed reasonable for drinks.  Me and my clients had reservation in the steakhouse.  The service was outstanding, and the food preparation was amazing however the size of the portions and the prices were WOW.   Yes the surprise came when I saw the prices.  reasonable bottle of wine $110, not many choices for red below this and the steaks were $49 and above for maybe a 7oz fillet.  bill came to $380 with only 1 desert.   This was no salad, no appetizer,  only 3 main courses with a couple of sides.  Portions were small and I was still hungry.    Tried it once and will not go back as there are many other good options in the area for steaks.  The biggest complaint is whoever designed this place should have their head bashed.  Why would you design the only high end restaurant in the 49r's stadium and you can't even see inside the stadium? ",3
" I received an offer of $49 for dinner at this place, when I left I paid over $180.00 without any drinks or soda. No where in sight was the offer $49 visible. It was a big lie and I will write to the 49ers and the restaurant to stop their luring of people with lies. ",3
" Start to finish service was attentive and cordial. Great aged beef rib eye. If you are a bourbon fan then the table side flight tasting is a must.  The sommelier, Patricia was extremely helpful really passionate about her wines and provided a lot of insight.  Most enjoyable.  We will return. ",5
" OK  it's in the new Levis Stadium so the architecture is a little differnet for a high end steak joint. The food was very good, prepared well, service was excellent and very attrentive. The wine list is exotic for most people, can be very pricy depending on what you are interested in drinking. The sommlier was very attentive and helpful, I must give my shout out to the staff, they were excellent. The night we were there was a non-event night so it was quiet. I would imagine it's a whole differnet atmosphere for games or concerts. Standing room only. The pub and the Restuarant share a common exit so it's intersting to see the mix of people, casual and upsclae dress mixing. I would recoomend this place as an original sort of special event venue. ",5
 I noted that there were 2 birthdays being celebrated and we were delighted when we arrived at our table to find personalized birthday cards which were signed by the restaurant staff!   It's those special touches and details that make a restaurant great!  The fix price meal was an awesome value - special for 49er ticket holders- and absolutely delicious!  Attentive service and cozy booth!  I had been to the restaurant during the Warriors playoff game - full house- so I was surprised how calm the restaurant was during our Saturday evening dinner.       Looking forward to our next dining experience at Bourbon Steakhouse! ,5
 The food was fantastic.  The service was phenomenal. First time here and can wait  to return. Thank your for a wonderful dinning experience . ,5
 I wasn't impressed with the food. I don't mind paying a premium price for premium food but this wasn't the case. ,3
 While the food was good the overall dining experience was not up to a high end steakhouse. ,3
" I've eaten at Michael Mina restaurants several times, so I know exactly what to expect.  This location is not up to the level you'd expect 1. for Michael Mina, and 2. for their prices.    You should know that the stadium runs the parking, so Valet is $8.00 for 2 hours or $15.00 for the night.    On to the food - Caesar Salad utterly mediocre.  I could have gotten it at Chili's.  The crab cake for $24.00 was also, mediocre.  The Ahi Tuna app described as ASIAN PEAR, PINE NUT, SCOTCH BONNET, MINT, SESAME - ALSO $24.00 was drowned in Sesame oil.  I don't recall any Asian pear.  I felt like I was eating sesame oil with salt and texture.  If I hadn't been with 6 other people THAT would have been sent back.  The sides were nondescript, and my New York Strip Steak at $52.00 was completely overcooked, though others at the table had their steaks cooked perfectly.  It was so overcooked, that the gentlemen at the table who'd I'd been teasing earlier about his medium-well steak order was teasing me back about karma.    Again, if I'd not been with colleagues it would have gone back.  On the plus side, the flavor of the smoke on the steak was delicious.   Even the caramel served after dinner was mediocre.  The service was good, but slow (though several of us were wearing black, and were not offered a black napkin, which is an expectation at this caliber place.).  It was a Tuesday night and Bourbon Pub next door was packed so drinks from the bar took a while.  That's what made me realize the problem with this place.  The Pub and the steakhouse are sharing facilities and there's just no way the steakhouse can deliver Michael Mina quality food with that much volume on the other side.    I knew the reviews of this place were mixed, but I was willing to chalk it up to a new place getting up to speed.  I no longer believe that to be true, and as far as I'm concerned, this place damages Mina's reputation. ",2
 I have mixed feeling about a high end restaurant with clientele that really don't expect a subtle hand with seasoning and presentation.  The food has flavor and certainly one can't complain about the quantity on a plate but for $350 for 2 people I would have liked more of a michelan star experience.  It was a treat to find Flannery meat on a menu and the steak was cooked exactly as requested.  The mushrooms were over salted to the point we had to request a replacement.  The beet salad was both delicious and had a beautiful presentation.  The kale salad not so much.  It was too bad the dressing was so thick that ingredients clumped  together.  I would also suggest that the kale be sliced in shorter pieces as it was difficult to pick up the salad with a fork without wrapping it like spaghetti.  The service is wonderful and very attentive and I would say  Bourbon Steak is a fun place to eat. ,4
 We waited 20 minutes for our waiter to take our drink order.  Then he finally came and didn't apologize for the delay and acted as if that was the norm.  Both the salmon and shrimp cocktail starters were ridiculously small and expensive.  It was an embarrassing to be sharing them with another couple.  Then the $49 filet was blah and the side of corn for $10 looked like it was dumped out of a can.  Golden Yukon potatoes was a joke and more like potato gravy.  Our bill was $800 and I felt completely ripped off and disappointed when I left.  Never again Bourbon Steak House and I feel robbed for even spending my time writing this review. ,2
" The food was nothing to write home about.  Our steak was undercooked for the requested medium rare.  The overall experience was dining at an upmarket chain restaurant, which is fine.  I had hoped the Michael Mina name would elevate it above that level but recognise that it may have been an unrealistic expectation.  The positive was the attentive and friendly service. ",2
" This restaurant has surpassed my every expectation.  Not only was the food exceptional but the level of customer service was top notch. The whole staff was very attentive to all our needs and did so without hesitation. My water glass was ways full, offered perfect recommendations and made every penny worth while.  I would recommend Michael Mina's to anyone looking for a special occasion restaurant and out of this world food. ",5
 Not happy about $15 Valet!  The food was good and the service was great! ,3
" We're HUGE Michael Mina fans, over the past 10-12 years we've been to almost every from Las Vegas west.  We're regulars at RN74, Arcadia and Michael Mina (St. Francis, SF).  Since Bourbon Steak opened we've wanted to go but really weren't interested in a restaurant at a football stadium.  What a huge mistake.   When you walk through the doors you're inside of the Pub, please do not let this fool you, it's a completely separate venue.  Walking into the restaurant we were greeted by Ed Tracy, the operation's officer, he welcomed us and took us to our seats.  A few minutes later Jason our waiter came by to introduce himself, what a great guy, friendly and attentive with the right amount of space.  A bit later Ed stopped by to talk about the wine's we'd brought and to take our drink order, and talk about what they've put into the restaurant to make it special.  We had one of the very best meals that we've ever had that night, that's saying a lot, we've eaten at some of the best places in the bay area multiple times.  We live very close to The Table (Willow Glen hot spot) and Arcadia, I'm afraid we'll be dining at a football stadium way more in the future.  If you go, ask for Jason and say hi to Ed, amazing staff and phenomenal Rib Cap. ",5
" Mediocre food, forgetable service, and crazy prices.  I think your paying for being inside the stadium.   Steaks not cooked right.  Seafood dish had to be sent back (very bland), tiny appetizer for $23, and the $10 baked potatoes were hard and undercooked.  Mac and cheese was so-so.  $500 for a dinner for four... shouldn't something standout?  Unfortunately nothing did, not even the server. ",3
 The  bourbon tasting is fabulous. The food is very rich... most side items were full of cream and butter. We loved the steaks and the dessert was glorious as well! It is not an inexpensive endeavor...it was about $350 for two of us and a few drinks. Whew...but we really enjoyed our dining experience and it was great for my boyfriend's birthday. ,5
" The service was very good and the food was good as well.  The Ribeye was good but not exceptional.  The New York steak came out luke warm and had to be sent back.  The Lobster Pot Pie was exceptional.  Overall, the restaurant was nice and the food was good but a bit pricey.  I have been to restaurants that were much better and not as expensive. ",3
" 1st time here , made reservation for 3.   Service was top notch: They seated us a a different table over the one they gave us. Did not gave us an attitude when we asked for tap water. Deliver and cleared dishes after 3-4 times during the course of dinner.   Food was good but had potential to be better: Appetizers was actually the best part of the meal, followed by dessert (their Mascarpone Cheese Cake - a deconstructed version...but was delicious), while the entree was good but could be better (I had Snake River Steak ""Bavette""... rub/flavor was good, but meat was a bit tough... maybe overcooked past Medium).  Wine list was amazing... made it hard to choose. ",4
" $8 Valet Parking with validation.....  easier and cheaper to just walk accross the street.  Was asked if we wanted still or sparkling water...wanted just flat, but a $10 bottle of Fiji water showed up  Restaurant looks like they just plopped up folding tables and chairs....no ambiance.  Service and food was very good.  $280 for a bottle of wine ($77), two entree's one app and a side dish.   Tip included. ",2
 The sides were all mixed together in some kind of cream sauce which we didn't like or expect. Noise level was excessive. I found the pricing to be very high and would not recommend. ,3
" The food was outstanding but when you have to wait for your cocktails for 30 minutes until you ask for them and your bottle of wine arrives first, it's clear that something needs to be worked on.  That sets the tone and so does the pace of the dinner.  Also, someone needs to consider the amount that's being charged for the valet.  It should be one price and not go up the longer your dinner is (or the longer it takes for the courses to be served). ",3
" Steaks were pricey, but worth it ",5
" This is an experience to remember! I would recommend a steak for sure. A side of mushrooms is enough for 2, so sharing sides is a good way to sample more delicious dishes. This place is pricey, so go prepared to spend some coin to enjoy yourself.  However, you can save some money and still enjoy wine if you pick something from the last page of the wine list. The title is 'Wines of consequence' but they are excellent, otherwise this restaurant would not serve them... You can get a good bottle of wine for under $100 from this selection, otherwise be prepared to spend a lot more. We spoke to the sommelier who recommended a nice bottle to pair with our food.  The atmosphere is quiet/romantic with soft lighting and nice privacy at your table. I would definitely go back for special occasions or a business trip! ",5
" Food are Good, atmosphere is nice. But $$$$ is needed. ",4
 The steak was very good for far too expensive for the portion size.  The signature ahi tuna appetizer was delicious and the price was more reasonable than any of the entrees on the menu.  The Caesar salad was mediocre and the side of creamed spinach was mostly cream.  They gave out complementary duck fat fries with 3 sauces instead of bread at the beginning of the meal.  The fries were well prepared but so salty! The ambience was not as inviting as expected with an industrial look and high noise level.  I do not think we will return as there are many other steak places in the area which are delicious and reasonably priced. ,3
 Came for one year wedding  celebration .  They treated us like royalty. ,5
 Steak was good.  French-fries were so salty had to return them.  Most uncomfortable chairs (an unexpected surprise) .  Good wine-list.  Great service. ,3
" Staff was great, food was okay, nothing was amazing. Prices were high for quality, much better steak house in the Bay Area. I am a niner faithful so we came here with high hopes and were let down. I hope they improve I'd love to make this a place to take new friends. ",3
" I had the duck breast, which was nice, but next time I might just order 6 appetizers.  The Fois Gras turin was great, as were the duck ravioli. ",4
" As a steakhouse should, this place has a large steak selection from prime, wagyu, A5, surf and turf etc. Our waiter was attentive and nice.  All of the food from the salads, to sides to steak and dessert were very good but I expected outstanding considering the prices that were charged.  Also, the sides of creamed spinach and truffle mac and cheese were very salty. French fries also very salty.  The location within Levis stadium is nice esp if you like football and all that goes with it. ",3
" I think the restaurant has been open a week so that would explain some of the mis-steps particularly at the bar.  The Caesar salad was was ""limp"" and the dressing was too salty for our tastes.  I ordered the carrot tortellini and my friend ordered the Wagyu beef (sorry I forget what cut right now).  The tortellini was very good and nicely presented but would not order as an entree.  The beef was okay and perfectly cooked.  Too much salt for our tastes again.   Presentation on the beef could be improved.  Best part was the complimentary fry samples.  There were three differently seasoned fries matched with 3 different dipping sauces.  Excellent.  Wine by the glass options were very good. ",3
" Expected an expensive meal, but the portions were tiny for a steakhouse. The sides were not for two. The Mac and cheese was perhaps the best I have ever had. Skip the baked potato. ",3
 Great dinner.. there's two spot. The bar section and the dining hall. We had reservation at the dining. Dinner was great. I ,5
" We went to Bourbon Steak &amp; Pub on its fourth day of operation. Chef Michael Mina knows how to get a restaurant up and going- it felt like they had been open forever- the service (kudo's to Derrick) was outstanding and the food was wonderful. I was a bit disappointed in the side potato trio- could have been a bit bigger portions and two of the three had very similar flavors. The bourbon cart- a trio of bourbons served tableside was a nice idea but for real bourbon afficionados, the selection of the bourbons should have been a higher quality- maybe two different fights could be offered. Overall the restaurant is a very fun place with very well trained, friendly staff and a spectacular menu. I will definitely go back. ",5
 I had the lobster pot pie and it was like a piece of heaven! I would recommend this to anyone! ,5
" My wife and I were once again totally amazed by chef Mina's creative ability and his latest effort attached to the new Levi Stadium is wonderful!  From the attentive staff, amazing wine pairings and incredibly thoughtful preparations, this is a welcome new addition to the South Bay.  The facility is incredible and although I don't have a 49er season pass, visiting here for one of Mr. Mina's amazing tailgates is definitely on my list.  With the tailgate, pub and restaurant there are three distinct dining experiences.  This review is for the restaurant but a tour of the pub and tailgate facilities has my mouth watering for a return very soon ",5
" Mina Group has never disappointed from a food perspective (been to most several times).  The restaurant has only been open 3 days.  For a ""Steak"" house, quite a few from the sea options (for my taste too many especially at the appetizer level).  The heirloom salad and kale salads were both very good, but nothing WOW.  The steak choices were broad.  We selected the NY and the Bone In Ribeye.  Both were done to perfection.  With Michael there in person (sighting)...would expect no less.  Deserts were amazing (beignet and Apple Crisp).  My disappointment was with the space (nice, but you look outside...nothing really to see of the new stadium) and the service (way over attentive...but expect it will hit its' stride). ",4
 This place is amazing great food and great service a must go we went for dinner in the dinning room we will go bar to check out the sports pub can't wait thanks again for an amazing evening ,5
 I took my girlfriend there for her birthday and with my obsession with lobster I had to try the Lobster Pot Pie. It was absolutely amazing. The table side service/presentation was great. Watching this dish come out in a pot was great. Just be sure to have your camera ready! Everything we ordered was delicious down to the dessert. But to be clear this is a very fine dining restaurant and prices match. :D ,4
 I highly recommend this place. We are planing to back again. ,5
" The restaurant is a warm and beautiful destination.  The staff is attentive and friendly. The food is absolutely outstanding, so delicious. The dessert is a must try. All the drinks coming from the bar made me want to taste them all. Really enjoyed the five star service. Will definitely eat there again. ",5
 We live locally and really enjoy our visits to the Pub. I appreciate the staff from greeter to manager. They all make you feel like you're a VIP every visit.  The food comes quickly and is always hot n fresh. The menu is varied and one can order from either the pub or fine dining side. What a great place. ,5
" We didn't realize the Bourbon Pub was located AT Levi Stadium so it was sort of weird to pull up and have to valet park at an empty stadium - other than that our visit was delightful.  The restaurant is open and airy for a pub-type restaurant. Cocktails and beer were reasonably price although by no means cheap.  Great beer selection including some we had never seen before.  Our server was friendly and helpful - if he didn't know the answer he found someone who did.   Very attentive and we didn't have to beg for our check after we were done eating.  Onion dip appetizer was excellent - savory with a robust, rich onion flavor.  Avocado toast was less of success being extremely bland and underseasoned.  Two of us had the Gold Rush Burger - they were cooked as ordered and came with specialty bacon and aged cheddar.  Excellent - fries were crisp and lightly salted.  Side salad was sort of plain but basically what I would expect.  Fish N Chips were hot, crispy and had very little grease - - you got a huge serving - too much for one person to eat.  A great meal - we will definitely come back. ",4
" Came in about 15min before our reservation. Was ready to be asked to wait a little longer outside or something but was welcomed to wait at the bar! The hostess was able to find us and seat us right when a table was available.  Our server, Danielle, was great! Friendly and attentive to our table!  Please keep up the good work! And keep the pretzel and cheese appetizer on your menu forever or! Amazing eats! ",5
" I've been there twice now. I went back the second time because the food was tasty and the ambience was energizing and fun. The lunch crowd is very mellow and hangs back to eat and watch tv while having quiet conversations in their groups. Come in earlier as the tables are full as well as the bar itself. I recommend reservations via OpenTable. I also recommend the Moscow Mule, which is refreshing and filling. The burger was large so I was able to save half for dinner.  The wait staff is kind, considerate, and professional.  Parking is easily accessible across the street and provides a nice walk after the meal before the drive back to work or wherever you're headed. ",5
 Pretty good.  Limited menu and kind of expensive.  Saw a 49er there. ,3
 I enjoyed the ambience and energy of this place! I brought along some of my co-workers who wanted to check out the Pub and they all thought the same thing. I will be back again for sure. ,4
" The food is very good, the service is good but this is a high-priced lunch in a small space. I still don't undertstand why they don't expand into their other spaces to accommodate more lunch time crowd vs. stuffing everyone around bar. New place...still needs some work. ",3
" The food and drink are outstanding. Service exceeds expectations. Anaid was a super waitress and Nick a superb manager. Can be a bit loud in the crowd, but not unmanageable. A great spot in Santa Clara. ",5
" Excellence service, no waiting time with reservation. My kids loved the burgers and fries! My husbands NY steak was perfectly cooked to medium rare just as he ordered. Bourbon drinks a must try. Definitely going back. ",5
 Great appetizers.  Burgers were okay. Love 9ers decor.  Great service. Great bar. Family enjoyed it.  Make reservations especially during the lunch rush during work. ,4
  I would discourage anyone from going there. I went there for my birthday lunch with a friend. I felt bad he had to pay for an expensive lunch that was not worth it. ,2
" The servings are small and not always fresh. The avacado toast had burned toast which over powered the taste, the avacado was old, the frisse lettuce old and warm. For a $22 burger the bun should have been special. The beef and fries were good.  Do not expect to share any servings they are very small. The carrot cake is a joke. You will be hungry when you leave or that much poorer. The service was the best thing.  Parking is not good. There are too many better places. ",2
" This is my 4th trip.  Take customers to Bourbon Pub and they love it.  Casual and lively.  It is a sports bar with great burgers, ribs, and lots of comfort food items as starters. ",5
" We went on a night that the pub was not busy at all and the service was truly terrible.  Our water glasses were not filled, the appetizer we ordered never arrived, the waitress never checked in with us, and we had to fetch our own drinks from the bar because we saw them sitting there  for a long time and the waitress never got them and brought them to us.  There were more than enough employees, who all seemed to chat with each other and largely ignore the customers.  The food is very overpriced, and the salad in particular is just a medium sized plate of questionable lettuce with barely anything else that it is supposed to have.  If you want to have a drink and watch sports on TV this might be an OK place to go, but skip the food. Michael Mina should be embarrassed. ",1
" Unfortunatly the Pub side did not match up to the quality of the Steakhouse.  From the greeting to the quality of food it was a let down.  The Menu selection was not par to the expectations of a Sports Pub , especially one located in one of the greatest spots complexes in the world.   A medium rare burger was cooked at best rare and medium was on the upper end of rare. Pretzel was flavorless and The wings lacked the flavor one would expect from an Asian Fusion style wing.    Be cautious if bringing a family, soft drinks are dispensed from a can and refills are not included.   Our family of four had 2 Burgers, 1 Order of Ribs and a Child's Burger with 2 appetizers our bill came out to $ 200.00 plus. Wow unexpected.   A trip to Red Robin's made more sense.   Disappointed ",2
" We werenot happy with the quality of the food for the price we paid. Will not go back again. Bourbon steak is worth the price, but the pub is not. I was very disappointed at the the PUb, I was expecting so much more.  Kids menu, does not come worh a drink ir a side. The kids portion wad small in a hugu bowl. The mac and cheesey was grainy and rhe cheese had curdled. People kept coming to the table 24/7 to clear the table every 5 mins which was annoying. My kids were excited to go to eat at the Levis stadium. But we will not be returning to the Pub again or recommending it to anyone. ",1
 Discovered this place just this past week and went 3 times!  Can't keep doing that though. Food is great and pricey.  Will go back but will do so for dinner as a treat.  The Turkey burger is awesome -the fries are addictive. ,5
" Pathetic Service, overpriced drinks, mediorcre food - unless you jsut have to see Levi's stadium - do not bother going ",2
" The food is startlingly over priced and under delivered in terms of both amount and overall quality.  The obviously disconnected management team sets the tone for their servers and no one seems to notice that the customers are anything other than cattle.  The one reason this place gets repeat business: location, location, location. ",3
" Loud, fun, and good service.  The server came by frequently considering I was there for a meeting.  Servers are in an area where some lunches are business, some are social, etc.  Please gauge the frequency of ""Do you need another drink?"" requests to the clientele. ",3
" We did a stadium tour with family and wanted to make it a complete experience with an early dinner. We thought it would be fun and hoped it would be good quality for the price. It was amazing in every way! Service was fantastic, food was delicious and atmosphere was lots of fun! We highly recommend the restaurant and look forward to getting back there in the future. ",5
 We wanted to have a before game day experience so we chose the Pub. The menu is diverse with steaks to pub food. Our server was very helpful and the food manager checked in with us to make sure we were happy. The lemon drop martinis were fabulous. ,4
" We unknowingly ate here during happy hour and the ""punch of the day"" for $5 was delicious! Had the burger. It was deliciously seasoned and topped with mushrooms and melty blue cheese. But, would have liked a fresh veg on it, a slice of tomato or some greens. Fries were tossed with fresh herbs. Sever was very nice. Only complaint is that when she brought me change it was all $20s. I wasn't about to leave a $20 tip on a $58 bill so I had to get change at the bar. Oh, and we saw the punter Andy Lee eating with his family. ",4
" The good: service, ambiance.   The bad: nothing in particular. The food: good but not worth the price.  Very ""foodie"" menu but no wow factor. ",3
" Service was great.  Food was good, but pricey.  Wasn't at all crowded, which we liked a lot given that we had a busy 2yrs old with us.  Although we enjoyed our meals, more variety on the menu would be nice.  Wanted to park Valet, but didn't and would not recommend; the two guys that approached my car looked like criminals.  We parked in the garage across the street. ",5
" The only good thing about this place was the staff and service. They were friendly and prompt. However, who knows what i's like a busy night. We were one of four couples in the entire place (pub + steakhouse) that night.   I ordered the ""stew"" which came out entirely differently than was what described. I had to send the meal back - something I've NEVER done before. My second order, salmon, was fishy and unmemorable.   The two men with me ordered steak. One piece of meat had so much tendon in it he had to ask for a serrated knife to cut it. Gross!  The sides were just ""okay"". ",2
" Located in Levi's stadium, home of the San Francisco 49ers. I was there to with a group to watch a Dallas Cowboys game. The staff couldn't been more warm and friendly. The manager even sent over a complementary Start...Will most def return any Sunday the 49ers are not playing a game! HaHa ",5
" Decent food and beer selection.  Visited twice and food is good, wings, nachos, burger, philly steak.  However, all little on the pricey side (17 for a philly sub)?  Must be that Santa Clara/SF pricing.  Good place if your up for a game and want to do the whole stadium experience, but many more reasonable and good places nearby. ",3
" Nice place. Wonderful atmosphere. The steak was great, but a bit pricy. Happy Hour got me 1 liter Budlight for 5$. ",4
" I've been to Bourbon Pub several times now.  I want to love it because it's Michael Mina's (I even had an opportunity to shake his hand) but I can only say I'm in ""LIKE WITH"" this establishment. Some evenings are better than others. Most food options are tasty and others do not appeal to me at all.  I've consistently received exceptional service since from Mia (she is a rockstar) and have had only one one terrible experience from a new server.  I will chalk up the experience to growing pains of a new restaurant. ",4
 WE did not know there were two Bourbons- Fine dining and Pub.  Need to clarify ! ,4
" Love the action in the restaurant for the 49er game, food help enjoyed the game.  Service was very friendly.  Love and group inside the restaurant during the game, lively, hopeful and sad, especially the end.  But the food was the highlight.  Great idea to change the menu for certain games/teams. Thanks for a great afternoon of watching the 49ers with fellow Niners, almost like being at the game ",4
" Be Forewarned:  Making a reservation for a certain time via Open Table will not guarantee a table anywhere near that time.  Had reservations for a Business lunch at 12:15, did not get seated until after 1:00 PM and then in then special 'group functions' room that was 75% empty.  Glad someone thought of putting us there, not sure why it took almost an hour to think of it, or better yet, why they can't manage their dining room better to meet reservations.  Food was good but not exceptional, table service was fine. ",2
" Server 2091, Naomi had NO personal interaction with any of the 11 of us. Whenever we needed something, straw, beer, root beer float, we had to repeatedly ask her.   We had 4 kids, one 4 yo...he was given an uncovered Mason jar and we were sitting next to kitchen serving area--everyone was lucky he didn't dro it from the high table. Asked for a plastic glass from a supervisor, it was served uncovered--might want to consider kids covered plastic cups;). This Nana was nervous the whole meal.   Food was excellent, especially Nachos! ",4
" Made a reservation for 7:15, got to the pub at 7:10, didn't get seated until almost 8.  The atmosphere was great, and the appetizers arrived quick and were great.  BUT  It went down hill from there...It simply was too busy for the wait staff to keep up and we sat in idol for long periods of time.  None the less, we ordered the fillets from the steak house and they were pretty good, but the sauces had pieces of menu (paper) stuck to them and our waiter didn't check on us for a good 10-12 minutes after the food arrived.  I really wish it was better... the place is awesome and we love the Niners!  Maybe next time? ",2
 We closed out at the table because of the service. The bar top was way better. ,3
" Great tasting food but hot dishes were served Luke warm.  Loved the shrimp wrap.  Delicious! I expect better from a Michael Mina restaurant, especially at those prices. ",3
 The Bourbon Pub is inside Levi Stadium and reflects all the surroundings of a sports bar.  The menu is limited while the drink choices numerous.  The shrimp cocktail and chicken wings were very satisfying.  The steaks were excellent.  Some of the best creations on the menu are the desserts.  The lemon cheesecake was light and very tasteful.  This is an excellent site for a group get together around a televised sporting event. ,4
 The menu selection was sparse. The prices did not align with the quality of food (i.e. pretty high). The majority of meals on the bar menu did not come with a side item (or a very limited option). No soup options. ,3
" I wonder if Michael Mina has actually eaten here. I came here for my birthday with my family after our first choice was closed due to a power outage.    We started with the nachos. Looks: 11.  Taste: 4. They looked amazing - stacked nachos with stuff in between and an egg on top.  The kids lasted one bite and pushed the plate away. I ate most of them, but looks didn't translate into taste.  The kids ordered burgers. Way overpriced for a ""kids menu"" and not including a glass of milk or any beverage.  The burger was as dry as a charcoal briquette. Ketchup came in tiny receptacles as if there was a world-wide shortage.  It's ketchup, people!  My wife got the ribs.  Drenched in nice sauce, the meat was tasteless.    I got the fish-n-chips. Fish was good, chips were soggy. Again tarter sauce in small portions...why ration sauce?!   The beer was good, but that's because it didn't come from the kitchen.    Another visit isn't very likely. ",2
" Great food, service, ambience.  Love the Read Option ",5
" Upon entering the restaurant we were at first disappointed until we realized the pub is separate from the actual sit down restaurant.  Our waiter was amazing, he was personable and made wonderful suggestions for drink and menu. We asked about tasting menu and he immediately ask Chef if it was possible. Luckily for us it was a yes and we were delighted with 8 excellent courses. There wasn't one course that was just okay like sometimes happens. We loved everything presented. We were treated to table side cutting of the steak course.  My friends also enjoyed every signature cocktail they tried. ",5
 I have to say that this will be a special place for me and my friend to go to and watch games when the 49ers are away. The hosts greeted us right away--very polite and with smiles!  We were seated right away and was then greeted by our server. Loved the options for brunch as well as the regular PUB menu.  The food came out in a timely manner as we watched the game and the food tasted great.  I hope you forward this to Chef MInna and the team because I really enjoyed my experience here. I will definitely be coming by again! ,5
" Went here on a Friday evening for a friend's birthday, there were three of us and had a really good time.  Our waiter Patrick was awesome and overall serve was awesome.  Ordered appetizers (crispy pork croquettes, Ahi tuna tartare), two entrees of steaks (shared it), three side dishes, two deserts and three bottles of wine.  I thought the steak (prime dry-aged NY bone-in cut  and Wagyu, med-rare) was just okay and liked the Brussels sprouts side dish the best...maybe it was just me. ",5
" What a concept - a high end steak house at the brand new Niner Stadium - perfect place for a special occasion.   Venue is impressive and expectations were high -  prices are a premium but that was expected going in.  To cut to the chase, the service was abysmal considering the restaurant was not all that busy - simply unacceptable given the ambition and grand vision the establishment is putting forth.  The delay between being seated and being waited on was long enough to make one feel neglected.  The delay between placing our order and actually receiving our appetizers was aggravating.  Even after calling other wait staff over to our table to ask for attention, no real improvement was made in the service level.    The Ahi appetizer, prepared table side, was a winner.  The Caesar salad was absolutely pedestrian, completely uninspired and boring to the palette.  When the steaks arrived - they were actually served improperly - delivering medium rare to a medium order and visa versa.  The steaks (Filet &amp; NY) were good but not great. The Mac &amp; Cheese side was interesting but the potato trio fell short - coming out with a consistency more like paste, than a proper potato puree.   All in all - it is still a very cool place to go because it is in the Niners stadium.  My recommendation would be to pass on t e Steak house and dine next door at the Pub. ",2
" I'm not always a burger guy, but the burgers here are incredible. Super juicy, large in size, and just tasty!  The garlic fries are something to try, and the shrimp tacos are delicious.  The prices are definitely a bit higher than the norm; however, you never leave feeling cheated.  Well worth the visit. ",5
" We really enjoyed ur first visit to the Pub, the service, the food and the bonus of sitings of football players!! ! The happy hour drink prices were great, $5 bucks for a pbr and a shot of jameson.. quite a combination!  The food was served quickly and was steaming hot. The break at your table pile of nachoes was very flavorful.  Yes, I purposely chose a $24 burger, and it was amazing! I took half of it home and ate it cold the next day.. was still great! I was a little leary after reading other reviews and went on a holiday, but the experience was 100% positive! Can't wait to go back with some more friends and try other items! ",5
 The food (especially the wagyu burgers and the appetizers) were fantastic - high quaility  cuisine perfectly presented. ,5
" Food was fair, overpriced and restaurant too noisy. ",3
" Lunch was a great experience, but I was unhappy with my Long Island Ice Tea it was not made correctly, but that didn't stop me from having two. ",5
" Good food, good service at this fixture in the base of Levi's stadium. It's a little pricey (the duck spring roll appetizer is $15) but all of the food is artfully prepared. Don't miss an order of the garlic fries - much better than what's available at AT&amp;T park. The pulled pork burnt ends sandwich sounds better than it actually was. ",4
 The wait staff was very friendly and attentive. The lunch menu is limited but very good choices on what they are serving. I had lunch with my father for his birthday and we both enjoyed ourselves. I had the Wagyu Burger and my father had the Bison Burger. Both were cooked as we requested and the came with garlic fries. Good portion size and super yummy food! I would definitely return to try dinner or for lunch again. ,4
" We both went for the Bourbon Burgers, which they said were signature dish.  Good burger, but signature?  Wish we'd branched out a bit more, so maybe our fault, because most everything else coming out of the kitchen (that we were lucky enough to sit right next too and was fun to watch) looked amazing.  Server was very good.  Don't know why we had to wait 10 minutes for our reserved table at 1:00p since it was sitting there open and set the entire time.  We should have tried the nachos as recommended - they were more like ""reconstructed"" nachos from their appearance, and seeing them constructed was fun! ",3
 Food was OK but nothing special.  Pricey for what you get. ,3
" Worst ribeye I.ever.had and.ridiculous.for the price. Did.not taste.like.a.dry-aged steak. poorly.cooked, sent back and.still not.cooked.correctly. would.never.go.back.again. ",1
" We went to Pub for the first time and very very impressed with the ambiance, staff and food. It is a definite return venue for us. ",5
 Bourbon Pub is in at the billion dollar new Levi stadium and so it is not a surprise that it is very expensive. The service was great and the food and drinks were very good indeed. But the price is very high and at any of these steak house places the extras add a lot to the already high bill. I would return again but only if I didn't have to pay for it. ,4
" Unfortunately when we arrived there was very loud construction going on just outside the door.  The facility was very small and cramped, only about 3 booths and the about 6 high bar top tables which could sit only 2 people very cramped. Plus the bar.  Barely enough room on table to accomodate food.  Food was very good as well as service.  A little pricey for not so comfy seating. ",4
 Ok. So it's at Levi's Stadium but do they need to price it the same add if you were inside the stadium? Food is very good but prices are out of line for what you receive. Plus $5 for iced tea? ,3
" We were there for our 33 anniversary , everything was just awesome !! Thanks ",5
" I'm a picky person and this place was superb!  The food choices were excellent,  tasted amazing,  the service was unbelievable.  I've been to the finest places from Jamaica to Hawaii and the service here was impeccable.   They serve free gourmet french fries and then a decadent croissant.  You feel like they've built the restaurants just for you. Everyone must visit once. :) ",5
" The food was fantastic and service was great.  Us ladies had a really good time.  So much to sample and so much more to try, but get a big basket of the Cheesy Garlic Fries w/bacon, perfection! Oh, almost forgot, get the root beer float before you eat, much better than later, LOL ",4
 I thought the food was a little expensive. The shrimp tacos has very little shrimp in them for $27.00/over priced. ,3
 We had poor unattentive service and the waiter didn't seem like he belonged there.  We also had undercooked hamburger meat that had to be sent back and the price was way to high for lunch. ,2
 Second visit and not as impressed this time.  The Shrimp Tacos were downright bad and the the servers still did not have their act together on the menu.  I loved the Gold Rush burger the first time I went.  I'll be back again and update the review if the Pub improves. ,3
" this was a great experience for a special occasion. Everyone who worked there greeted us at our table and said happy birthday to my boyfriend. We had the ribeye, spare ribs, truffle mac n cheese, and potato purée trio. Everything was delicious. It didn't even feel like you were at the stadium. The pub is right on the other side of the wall but you couldn't hear any of the loud noises from there. ",4
" Given the price point and the big name chef name is on the door, I expected a better meal. The staff are great and the decor is cool (so is the location), but the food mediocre. There were a few bright spots, however: the Duck Spring Rolls were amazing and the Hot Pretzel appetizer was delicious, and the beer selection is great. The bad news: my kid's cheeseburger lacked seasoning and was cooked to well done. It was pretty bad, and she didn't finish it. My wife and I shared The Whole 9 Yards BBQ plate, which is plenty of food for two, but found it mostly bland. The ribs were chewy and hard to eat, not fall off the bone like you would expect. The sides that come with it were just... meh. We wanted it to be better than it was. ",2
" Steaks good, but sides sent back. Service very poor. Given the cost very poor value. ",2
" The atmosphere is kind of industrial, could be a little more elegant. The service was fine, the servers seemed to know about the food and had good suggestions. If you have an appetizer, try the pretzels with the beer cheese. They were amazing. One of my companions had a turkey burger. It looked very good. Another person had the bourbon burger. It looked delish! I had the pulled pork Sammy. It was ok, the BBQ sauce was a little sweet, I don't know when everyone started putting sole slaw right on the sandwich ((I grew up in the south and I don't remember this. It takes away from the pulled pork serve the slaw on the side (along with a serving of spicy BBQ sauce. ",5
" Steak was cold, and had to return. Lack of seasoning on steaks - Ambiance what you would expect for M.Mina establishment ",3
" Overpriced.  The menu listed a steak for two for $69.  Seemed pricy but reasonable.  We missed the tiny letters ""pp"".  The steak was not worth $138.  We will never go again and will not recommend it.  OpenTable is great! ",4
" We had a reservation for 12 people during happy hour and were seated promptly, served in a timely manner and over all had a great experience.  The bar was a little backed up (though not surprising with the Thursday night game crowd that was there) but our server Mia did a wonderful job and the food was outstanding!  I've been here on 4 occasions so far, tried something new on the menu every time, and loved every bite.  We'll definitely be back! ",5
 Celebration of new job ,4
" Excellent restaurant, very good steaks and other entrees are available for those who want something else. Good wine list. Staff is attentive and professional. Overall very good. ",5
 Service and food was exceptional for my 75th. birthday dinner. However a $286 dinner is a bit overpriced. $150 would have been more appropriate for what we ate. ,4
 My husband and I went there for date night. The service and food were both fantastic. We will definitely be back again ,5
 Excellent! I enjoy the atmosphere and food. The size of Appetizers are appropriate. And prime rib is excellent. Finally I took a cheesecake. It also delicious! ,5
" Excellent steak, delicious wine selection, very good and knowledgable waiter, the only tip I would give is I prefer my asparagus to be whole, a bowl of pre cut feels like syems and pieces ",5
 Anniversary dinner ,5
 Great food and wonderful service. ,5
" After three years (to the day) of dining at this Mina outpost, I've become a bit of on expert on the menu. They've made the appropriate changes throughout the years, weathered management and exec chef changes. The steak staff has seen it all, and always maintained the utmost quality and service. It remains my favorite place to dine across the world.   Allow me to recommend the famous Mina ahi tuna tartare as a starter. The bone-in New York from Allen Brothers for the main course. The cocktails are second to none, the current special Kaizen made with the their own personal barrel of Sonoma Distillery's finest. ",5
 Great service. Steak cooked to perfection. ,5
 Way - and I mean WAY over-priced.  Presentation A+. Service A+.  Food =  C-   Cost / value = very poor.   55$ Steak was served cold.  Didn't fix it.  Didn't apologize.  Oh and btw - no views of the stadium. ,2
" My wife and I had dinner there last Friday 4 August. Greeter at front door was very nice, Ryan our waiter was great, Tuna Tartare was good, creamed spinach was ok, the bone-in NY steak was horrible. The steak had gristle and was really tough, probably the worse steak we have ever had, including grocery store steak. QC must have been asleep that night to let a steak like that get through. My wife and I shared the dinner, had a bottle of wine and two drinks and the bill was $270 incl. tax w/o tip, big bill, little value. ",2
 Amazing service - amazing food - one of my favorites in the Bay Area ,5
" Excellent service and food, always a family favorite ",5
" Top Service, Food Quality excellent! Very good wine recommemdation. ",5
 Food and service was amazing!! ,5
 Best stake in the area (and even further out) - perfectly cooked and high quality meat - also very good espresso ,4
" An expensive place for the average person. With no appetizers and dessert, we spent  around $170 with tax and tip, ",4
 Always a great meal here with an extensive wine list as well. ,5
" Outstanding wines, steaks that are out of this world, and they brought a delicious birthday treat for my husband on the house! Definitely will be a repeat customer. ",5
 Too. Expensive and too noisy. ,1
 Steak was near perfect. Cream spinach was too salty.yummy for the mac n cheese.. It was our daughter's civil wedding and we celebrated just for the family. Thank you for the  dessert for the occasion.  Service was exceptional. ,5
" I hadn't been here in a while and after going this time I remembered why I hadn't come in a while. Me and my dining partner asked for 2 filets medium rare. Both were cooked differently: one was over and one was under. Its a STEAK place! If you can't cook steak properly well then, that's not great is it? We were one of two groups total there on a Friday night and our food took over 25 minutes to arrive. Can't imagine why. Very sub par and for the price, just don't..... ",2
" This was my second time at Bourbon Steak and my date's first time.  We had an OUTSTANDING time!  Our server actually remembered me from when I was there previously... about 6 months previously!  The service was outstanding, the food amazing, and my date even had an $85 glass of excellent French wine.  We also enjoyed a great whiskey flight.  We'll definitely be back! ",5
" Excellent steak (again) accompanied with good service and tasty wines, what more can you ask? ",4
" I was VERY impressed by the food and staff at Bourbon. From the host at entry, to our lovely waiter Jansen, to the other servers. Everyone went out of their way to ensure that our meal and experience was top notch. They all shook the birthday person's hand and Jansen made sure that none of the food contained  my many allergy triggering foods. Steak was perfectly prepared, crispy tuna poppers were a tasty little starter.  My only critiques. Lobster Pot Pie (LPP) amazing flavor, great lobster. I would just mention to people that it's not as big as the pot it's served in. It's a decadent meal, but not enormous.  The valet parking, so our meal lasted longer than 2 hours, we had cocktails, appetizers, LPP, steak, after dinner drinks and dessert. Surely, after spending $300 on food, drinks and tip the valet parking fee should be waived, no? A truly great meal never ends in two hours! And it was indeed a great meal.  Dessert wise, my strawberry cheesecake was good. The complimentary birthday cake item was ok.  Not sure if I was full from the rest of the meal, but I didn't finish either and that never happens! ",5
" very good food - the guys said the steaks were outstanding!  the service was excellent, all in all a very positive experience for a Business dinner. ",5
" Amazing quality food. The staff was very attentive and helpful. The restaurant is more high-end than I expected, which is nice. Nice decor. ",5
 wagyu...bomb! Butterfly fish...delish. Complimentary fries &amp; mashed potato...on point. Drinks...omg and @ the pub afterwards too. -asked bartender to give me a Rec and it was amazing! Server...amazing service! Jerome? ,5
 Very pricey for the quality of the food in all categories ,3
" I was a little intimadated at first when we walked into the bar but we quickly found seats and the bartenders were welcoming, friendly and helpful as we waited for our friend.  When our friend arrived we dined in Bourbon Steak, not the pub.  The food was excellent and all three of us loved it.  Great Michael Mina restaurant and we will for sure be back. ",5
" I've eaten great restaurants all over the world and Bourbon st was as good as any. The service was incomparable, the waiter incredibly knowledgeable, friendly but totally professional and enthusiastic about us as diners as well as the chef and food. Can't recommend it enough. And the wine list was stellar. Not inexpensive but you would not expect a place of this quality to be so. ",5
 Super disappointing and overrated. Not up to the level of other Michael Mina restaurants. A small step above sizzler. ,2
" Dry aged steak and spot prawn were ran out at the time we arrived. The appetizer were firm and hard to swallow. The NY steak were hard too, even worse than the one I cook at home. ",1
" We had the Valentine menu and it was a great value with great food.  The waiter seemed rush, must be because they were fully booked for Valentine.   We were never asked for the wine or upgrade menu option.  We both loved our duck and branzino dishes.   The fish and the truffle macaroni and  cheese was really good.  Will skip the souffle next time.   I would do Valentine dinner here again because of  great value and might come back to taste the regular menu ",4
" Atmosphere was great for Valentine's Day, relatively quiet and intimate.  Duck was well prepared along with the filet mignon. ",5
" Intricately managed details, knowledgeable waitstaff and great decor on the steakhouse side make this a pricey but memorable meal. ",4
 My friends and I had lunch in the Pub. It was a casual environment with great food! The fried pickles were my favorite! ,5
" I recommend the tasting menu for $125/person. Six courses and each was delicious. The wagu beef stands out as a favorite plate. The service is excellent. For the price, the ambiance is quite casual. There are big screen TVs and it can get loud especially if you are there during a Giants game or other televised Bay Area sporting event. For that reason, I wouldn't recommend it as a romantic dinner spot. A special celebration with couples would be more appropriate. I highly recommend. ",5
 Shared a meal with my wife. The bone in rib eye came sliced which was perfect for sharing. The melon and tomato salad was very refreshing. The black truffle Mac and cheese was awesome. The bourbon cart experience was a real treat. The service was superior. You will not be disappointed. ,4
" Set your expectations for great food, but a terrible wait for a table.  We went on a Friday night, when there was another event at the stadium, and we were early... bad move.  Waiting in the bar was terrible.  It took 25 min standing 3 deep to get a drink.  Standing room only, no place to set a beverage, loud and sometimes obnoxious patrons. Bourbon Steak needs a more appropriate and comfortable waiting area (with bar).   Food (duck and short ribs) was great, if overpriced. Ambiance is good, chairs are really uncomfortable.  Staff is very friendly.  Bourbon flight at the end is a great dessert. ",3
" The food was delicious and the hostess and our waitress were great, even accomodating an extra person who showed up before our stadium tour. ",5
" Awesome food and awesome service. Pricey but worth it. I was looking forward to trying the Lobster Pot pie, but they ran out after i ordered it. Instead i got the Rib Cap which was also amazing. I went here to celebrate my wedding anniversary, and the staff made us feel special on our special day. ",5
" Bringing back the 50's night club vibe is the Bourbon Steak &amp; Pub at Levi Stadium in Santa Clara. The atmosphere is of old time football with rolls of leather and mirrors (cleverly disguised televisions). It's not a large restaurant. In fact it is adjoining Michael Mina's other culinary ventures of the Bourbon Steak Pub and Michael Mina's Tailgate. The staff is amazingly attentive and gives you the attention that a five star zagat restaurant demands, but they do it with confidence and a sense of humor. The menu is filled with culinary delights such as Truffle mac &amp; cheese, Bone in rib eyes and Lobster pot pie (which sells out before 7:30PM weeknights). Go try it out. This new regular haunt will exceed your expectations. ",5
" Have been here a few times.  First, they need to get a different entrance into the restaurant.  Coming through the Pub, especially when there is sports on, doesn't set the right tone.  The food is inconsistent.  We have ordered the same items a few times (this last time, 3 of us had the tomato and burrata salad) and they are all different in their composition and taste.  The service seems to be evolving.  We had a number of ""trainees"" it appeared helping our table.  The orders were not taken right and one of the group had to wait 10 minutes for their main (others decided to wait which impacted their meal).  As this is a steakhouse, would expect beef to shine.  The short rib was dry.  The rib eye was tough.  The NY and the Ribcap were great. ",3
" Have been here twice and have to say, the food is wonderful. You must have a reservation and my only complaint is that the seats (unless you have one of the 3 booths) are not very comfortable. I know their intent is to have the restaurant have that sport bar feel, but they could have achieved that with more comfortable chairs (plus purse hooks would be nice since their chairs do not allow you to hang a purse due to their design).  In general all high tops make their choices limited for seating but again, I think it makes it easier to see the screens around the room.  I like the restaurant but you asked my opinion so I am giving it. ",4
" MAKE A RESERVATION as they fill up quickly as this space is actually quite small. The food was very good but over priced. $24 for a cheeseburger? How often are you willing to pay that? The ribs were acceptable and tasty but were not outstanding. 1/2 rack was $18, which is acceptable and still $7 cheaper than a cheeseburger! I would go with a work-group because it's down the street and still a  novelty. I would not make the trip from home or go there specifically for a meal, otherwise. But that's just me... ",3
" Initial impression was good but the meal went downhill from there. Atmosphere was nice. Server was extremely nice but had too many tables. Every time (literally every time) we needed water, more wine, or anything we had to flag our waiter down. Both of our steaks came out at the wrong temp. My wife sent hers back but I just ate mine. It's a steakhouse and at the very minimum I expect to get my steak prepared per my order. Overall the food was good once corrected but I don't think we will return. I think for the price and service there are better steakhouse alternatives. ",2
 Excellent food and service! I thought the hamburger was the best I ever had! ,5
" Other than a bit of a mixup with table being prepared late and possibly a little understaffed for the amount of people, food was amazing and atmosophere of restaurant was excellent. ",5
" Overall very nice ambience, dining right at the Levi's stadium with a lot of parking (garage ramp across street, on non-game days of course, is literally empty). The energy builds up quick on a weekday evening, great for happy hour and dinner. ",4
" Spontaneous choice for an after-work meal. I elected to use my $50 OpenTable Dining reward together with a gift card my daughter had so we splurged on the menu and enjoyed the bourbon flight which introduced us to new flavors and personalized service. It was crowded and we were seated on bar-height stools at a tall table in the bar area right next to the pass so there was a lot of traffic but it wasn't too distracting. Overall, we had a very nice dinner together and plan to return. ",5
 Chimmichuri skirt steak was excellent as were the buffalo wings. The nitro stout was spectacular ,4
 The food was delicious however the service was slow ,4
" It’s a noisy bbq sports bar environment that smells like great bbq...except there’s literally no bbq on the menu...how???  We ordered tacos and the pork wasn’t tender or flavorful, def not slow smoked.   Overall it was one notch up from regular bar food, no desire to go back unless they develop a real bbq offering. ",3
" We ate on a Friday night, when there wasn’t an event at Levi’s Stadium.  (I suspect the place is very different on event days!) It was quiet, but they’d closed off the surplus space and it felt cozy. The menu is gourmet bar food, and is a good size: long enough so that you’ll find something you’ll like, small enough that they are likely to make every dish on it several times a night. We had a party of 5, and everything we ordered was cooked not just well but perfectly. Even the Mac and cheese from the kids menu was just right. ",5
" Our friends wanted to go there, I've been a couple of times, but the food is just average and so is the service. It's not terrible, it's just ok, so it's not a place I am excited to keep returning to, I end up going because someone else wants to check it out.  Great if you want to have a drink and watch sports on the TV's. ",3
" Bad service, signature cocktails were not good at all tried 3 different ones and food was mediocre been there several times and seems like declining every time. ",2
 Tator tots and Fish'n'Chips are BACK ON THE MENU!!!!  Best Pub food ever!! ,5
 Another amazing meal. The new chef has received the torch passed to him: The GREATEST LUNCH MENU IN Santa Clara!!!! A wonderful staff and second to none hand crafted cocktail list. (currently Sci-Fi themed) Pictured is the Nashville Hot Chicken Sammy. So good. ,5
" Always fabulous having dinner here with friends.  The wait staff are phenomenal, incredibly friendly, always make great suggestions, and help everyone have a great time!  Really appreciate this spot in Santa Clara. ",5
" pleasant servers, good banter and respectful distance when conversation was ongoing. some confusion on which table ordered the food and the side dish preference of salad vs fries was not what was served, got fries :( ",4
 Cool sports bar with great food located in Levi's stadium ,5
" Our waitress was MIA.  Had to ask everyone else for drink menu, please take our order. ",4
" Gold rush burger tasted different, still good, but was previously great. Chicken sandwich was good as well.  Service a little slow at bar, it was a newer person training- so was expected. Still a good experience overall. ",4
" Calling out Bourbon and their staff that day for really making better accommodations for me and my party.  I asked to be seated in the dining room (steakhouse side) because I was entertaining customers and we had business to discuss.  They happily obliged and set us up in the dining room and we were the only ones there.  Furthermore, they had about 3 different people checking in on us to make sure we were being taken care of.  Food was really good from appetizers to dessert and espresso.  Really helped give my customers a great experience and allowed us to focus on the tasks at hand. ",4
 Excellent restaurant and wonderful lunch. Really enjoyed the food and service. Very nice selection and burger was amazing. Special Paleo request no issue for chef. Thank you Bourban. ,5
 Outstanding cocktails.  This time I tried the steak sandwich and wasn't impressed.  Still my favorite place for a burger and cocktail ,5
" Order took 45 minutes to table. Requested 'rare' burger and even with generously low expectations received very well done. Others ordered medium and had at least some pink, this was thoroughly brown with no time to expect a reorder - our lunch ran way late as it was, had to inhale the food and rush out. ",3
 Great food.  We had a business lunch for 5 and everyone like the food and the relaxed atmosphere. ,5
" Surprised by the food and serve. Great overall service, hard to get these days. The drink and food were outstanding! ",5
" If you love $$$ food but are not a fan of low lit pretentious atmosphere this may be the place for you.. If you are a sports fan.  We were able to watch much of the 18 inning playoff win by SF Giants with an enthusiastic crowd while enjoying delicious juicy melt in your mouth duck, butter soft filet mix on and the Heritage pork trio sampler, all of which was perfection.  The service was what one would expect from a high end restaurant and was impeccable.  The staff was friendly and very helpful, giving tips for attending the 49ers game the next day. ",5
" My very expensive steak came out well on the outside and raw on the inside. Had to send it back twice. For the price it was not worth it. My baked potato was under cooked, still hard on the inside. My wife's lobster pasta came out cold and when sent back to the kitchen it took too long to return. The service was good and they did remove two glasses of win for the inconveniences. I do not judge restaurants by price but by value received. I think the value at this restaurant was not there. I would not return and I would not recommend to friends. ",2
" My family tried the Pub (open for lunch) on a Saturday at 2 p.m. The hostesses were friendly but the service went down from there. We sat for 15 minutes before our server appeared. After another 15 minutes, our drinks came. We ordered a starter of nachos, but within another 25 minutes, our main meals were served. We never received the nachos, and it was difficult to flag down our server. When we received the $160.00 check, the $14 nachos were there. I have enjoyed Michael Mina's restaurant in SF, and Arcadia in San Jose, but this offering is about a half-step up from TGIFriday's in service and quality. Ribs were tender but sauce was way too sweet. My daughter's chicken made her very ill.  Noise level is not ""energetic;"" it is earsplitting. ",1
 Food was terrific and the staff were extremely nice and welcoming.  Went the extra mile to congratulate us on our 27th Anniversary. ,5
" The pub side is very loud, but the steakhouse side is surprisingly a lot less noisy. Food was pricey as expected, but quality and taste was not at the same level as other high end restaurants. But it was still good. ",3
" First experience was so so. Seemed to be under staffed for the lunch crowd they had. Food was just ok. Well the burgers were great accroding to my friends, the ribs were tough and had alot of gristle/fat. The steak that was ordered was asked for Medium Well and it came out Medium Rare. We sent it back to refire it and it took 16 minutes to get it back and we had to ask where it was.. The steak was comp'd. Based on my first time experience I would not recommend to my friends. ",2
" The fish &amp; chips were awesome! Perfect breading to fish ratio! The place was loud, but I expected that.  The waiter was helpful, but then kept disappearing.  We had nachos and when we were done the manager cleaned off the table, taking the silverware.  When our food came out, it took about 10 minutes for us to get someone to get new silverware. A lunch salad was the size of a small dinner side salad. The pulled pork sandwich bottom bun was so soaked with vinegar that it was mushy and inedible. Took almost 20 minutes to find our waiter to bring the check. Don't go for lunch if on a schedule.  We were there for about an hour and a half and at least 40 minutes of that time was waiting for things we'd asked for - drinks, silverware, check. ",2
" We all agreed the food was delicious, however for a restaurant charging very high prices, the service could have been better. Our table was next to the noisy, traffic traffic area, and our waitress left us to 20 minutes at a time without checking in. The cost was not worth the experience. Valet service was disorganize and we waiting a long time for our car. Validation is unreasonable for dinner. ",2
" Bourbon Steak &amp; Pub is a bit pricey, but for foodies, it's a great place to try their tasting menu.  Food was excellent and service outstanding. ",5
" 2nd time here during mid-week for business lunch.  Food is great but service is too slow and the restaurant is way, WAY too loud for the business/networking lunch crowd.  Once the ""new"" factor/hot-spot thing wears off I may be cautious if and when I come back, even though the food is amazing... ",4
 While we enjoyed seeing the restaurant we probably won't go back for two reasons:  the menu is very limited with no choices for a nice salad or lighter sandwiches and the noise level makes it impossible to carry on a conversation across the table.    The service experience starting with the hostess was extremely efficient.  Very professional and obviously well trained! ,3
 Great food and atmosphere!  Delicious steaks and good wine selection.  I want to go back and try several other menu offerings.  Friendly and timely service. ,4
" Thanks for a wonderful evening - service was amazing, food was exceptional and we had a great time.  This was our first time at the restaurant - we'd attended the soft launch of the Tailgate Experience, and the restaurant didn't fail to meet all of our expectations.  Lisa our server was wonderful, we met the new manager Ron, and got to say thank you to Michael himself on the way out.  We will definitely be back soon. ",5
" I was so excited to go here, but our group of 6 was clearly disappointed with the service in the Pub.  Staff was friendly, but not organized and were clearly not experienced.  Drinks took 20 minutes to get and then the order wasn't correct. Food was good, but not memorable.  It was fun to go here once cause it's in Levi Stadium! ",3
" My favorite part of the dining experience was how nice &amp; accommodating the staff was.They made us feel right at home &amp; the manager even came over &amp; talked to us about the restaurant. We started out with fried pickles as an appetizer &amp; that was one of my favorite parts of the meal. Great selection of Wine &amp; Beer...I enjoyed a great big 1Liter beer which was delicious! My boyfriend had the skirt steak &amp; I had the Ribs. I was not really crazy about the ribs, a lot of fat on them &amp; the sauce was a bit too sweet for my taste. But my boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed his steak. It was his birthday &amp; although they do not sing they did make him feel special &amp; brought out a great dessert that said ""Happy Birthday""on it!All in all it was great!Thank you! ",5
 The first time I ordered the pork tacos I was blown away.  Second time I wondered if a different chef had prepared them..  Third time and there was literally less than 3 oz of meat in ALL of the tacos total.  Declining food quality has simply me off this place. ,1
" we were in town for the Eagles-49ers game.  arrived at the restaurant on time for our 8:15 res, however, did not sit down until 8:50.  we were a bit miffed by this, but didn't care all that much, great beer selection and games on in the bar while we waited.  Upon sitting down, we were pleasantly surprised by an offer of 4 glasses of champagne as an apology for the wait.  all the items were delicious, from the comp'd fries to start, the tuna tartare app, all the way through the requested sliced bone-in ribeye.  also, the $20 corkage seems reasonable for a restaurant of this stature, will definitely return if in the area again.... ",4
" We were attending the 49er game the next day and looking forward to a good meal.  The entire experience was very disappointing.  Although our waiter was nice, I believe that the kitchen and bar let him, and therefore us, down.  My rating for the disappointing service is more about the poor timing of the food, having to ask for bread, water, etc, and not our waiter.  We waited an eternity for our cocktails.  My friend's meal was so bad it had to be sent it back.  The ahi tuna tatare was ordinary.  My NY strip steak was good, but not what I had expected.  On the positive side, the dinner rolls were excellent and the restaurant showed both class and good judgment not to charge for the meal that was sent back or for the replacement. ",2
 We love Michael Mina restaurants! This was just another place that make us can't wait to come back to Vegas and eat here again. ,5
" unfortunately we caught them on a bad night. Cesar salad was less than average and fishy, rib-eye was really fatty and lobster tail was extremely small... deserts were average at best. Will go back, but hopefully they wow us next time. $400 for 4 of us last visit... ",3
" Went to Bourbon Steak for business dinner and decided on the tasting menu with the wine pairings.  As is with a high end restaurant it is not cheap but the service and the food were outstanding.  7 or 8 courses - I forgot now how many with a different wine with each.  Every dish was outstanding with incredible flavors.  The Sommelier explained each win pairing with each course and each course was explained as well.  To top the evening off, Michael Mina came by and sat down with us to discuss the restaurant and our opinions of the food.  Highly recommend the place.  The Pub area is a bit noisy as any good sports Pub should be.  Awesome TV's and Happy Hour drinks are great $5 Liters of beer!  Definitely going to be hanging out after work. ",5
" The steakhouse restaurant was smaller than I expected and was a little difficult to carry on a conversation as we were competing with the music and noise level from other patrons.  However, the meal was fantastic and the service was good.  We were immediately seated by an attentive hostess. It was a bit pricey, but I was satisfied with the quality of the meal. ",4
" Thought we'd try the new Michael Mina's at Levi's Stadium for our anniversary. Had been to the more casual ""Tailgate"" and enjoyed it but wasn't sure about the more upscale Bourbon Steak. Noted in our reservation that it was our anniversary were treated like VIPs including a nice card from the staff at our table. Food and Service were top notch. Short Ribs literally melted in my mouth and the additional ""Chef's complements/amuse-bouche""were spot-on. Especially enjoyed the carrot tortellini ""intermezzo"" which I didn't think I'd like, but was exceptional and the Beignets with Macallan Custard was heavenly. Only draw back was the music could be a little softer. We will certainly be back. ",4
 This was second time i took my customer there in a week.  Both times the service was very poor and second time the steaks were tough.  They have long way to get up to speed with SSF.  It took 20 min to get our drinks and the spacing of food was to long.  We had to ask several people for our drinks and status of the food ,2
 My wife and I had dinner at the dining area away from the bar. You have a choice on what section you want to sit in. Bar area is a typical setup TVs all over for maximum viewing. The dining was quiet and great service from the staff. I ordered the ribeye steak and it was terrific. My wife had the pork chop and it was also good. The next time we will try the lobster pot pie. Be aware certain things can only be ordered in the dining area and the bar area. Definitely going to try the bar area for lunch. ,4
 Steaks were good. There are other steak houses in the area that are superior to Bourbon Steak House. ,3
 Love the table-side cut nachos and the staff (esp Chef) are amazing!! Great place to nosh some noms and drink after work :-) ,5
" Thank you for your excellent, attentive service!!  Yummy food and great beer!! ",5
" The best place to watch a game on this side of town. Not the cheapest, but the food is high quality. ",5
 Bring back the tots!!! Please please please bring back the tator tots!!!!!! ,4
" Always a great quality burger, good beer selection and quick service. ",4
 Definitely recommend their nachos! Most of their food is delicious and usually review 5 stars but unfortunately had a below average experience today.. Got the burger of the month (Breakfast burger) and ended biting down on a hard plastic piece.. they comp'd me a drink (I thought they comp'd the round but they charged us for the other two) but did not replace my food for which I ended up finding 2 more smaller pieces of the plastic in. Not the best experience for a favorite restaurant of mine.. can't all be great I guess right? All other times I've been here it's been great food and great service. ,3
 Great drinks! ,4
" Ordered the fish tacos... not bad, not the best on the menu in my opinion though. The nachos and pretzel apps are to-die-for though. Definitely recommend. ",5
" Nice place but a bit pricey, 3 large beers, 2 appetizers, 1 side of sweet pot fries was $98 before tip ",4
" OVERALL EXPERIENCE WAS GOOD. THE PLACE WAS PACKED. I LIKED THE COMPLIMENTARY VALET SERVICE. THE FOOD WAS FRESH BUT A BIT OVER PRICED- $85 FOR LUNCH FOR TWO (AND WE DID NOT GET ANYTHING SPECIAL) WAS DEFINITELY ON THE HIGH END. OTHER COMPARABLE PLACES IN THE AREA CAN FEED 2 FOR $40-50 RANGE. WOULD RECOMMEND, BUT NOT FOR A WEEKLY OUTING. MM ",5
 We came in to watch the NCAA championship game. It was perfect. If you like bourbon.. you can't go wrong. I would highly recommend to a friend ,5
 Food was good but way over priced. We paid $29 for a small skirt steak that came with a small salad. I was not full when I was done and I'm not a big eater..... ,3
" Menu online wasn't accurate, as they just switched over to a Spring menu.  As a vegetarian,  I have been to many steakhouses without issue.  There is usually at least a pasta on the menu to meet my needs.  Well there wasn't at Bourbon Pub.  Only apps and salads.  The chef ""created"" a veggie sandwich for me, but it was lackluster and void of flavor.  The garlic-parmesan tater tots were excellent and the best part of our meal.  The gentleman that poured my bourbon flight was excellent and the best example of proper customer service that you should expect at a Michael Mina restaurant.  I might go again for happy hour if a game I want to watch is on, but otherwise, I wouldn't return.  Sadly... ",2
 Great food. Super atmosphere. Best people! ,5
" I'd been coming here since the day after it opened. The Bourbon Steak serves excellent food and the Pub serves great food too. The service, unfortunately, has become horrible. The last two times I went to the Pub, we were seated at one of the tiny tables, which is fine for the two of us, but we ordered salads and dinner, which on two occasions, they brought at all at once, which we could barely fit on the table, let alone the basic idea that a salad is a course. The same happened with appetizers, except a 5 minute delay, when the waitress asked to take away the appetizer, which we had only just started eating. It seems like management changed and the service went to hell. ",3
" The Occasion was to mark a long time Co-worker leaving Sad to see him go, but to celebrate the years he was here Very good food selection Fantastic Bourbon / Whiskey list Atmosphere was great and the staff was outstanding ",5
 Wasn't aware that it was Trivia Night -  Very noisy. ,4
 Both Yeyson and Jerome were great. The tomahawk was flavorful and tender. Will go back soon! ,5
" I loved the atmoshpere with the energetic crowd watching the game. Wonderful multiple large screen TV's.  The buffet brunch was very dissappointing, however. When they said ""brunch"" I envisioned a more traditional fare including ham, omelets, hashed browns, mimosas, and the like. Most of the food they did have was unrecognizable to me. There was a roast pig but the meat was buried somewhere in a dish with green sauce. The beef brisket was very good but the closest thing I saw to a brunch offering was a cold egg and cheese burrito. Definitely not worth $45 a person.  We had reservations but were seated off in a corner. We were near a screen that was showing the Seahawks game but a staff member did change it to the 49'ers game when I asked. ",3
" Over-hyped embarrassment from an over expanded chef. MM is talented but that does not translate well to this location buried on the first level of the stadium. Nothing redeeming here. Aggressive seasonings (salt) and uninspired offerings. Go if you enjoy a LOUD bar, and then dine in a small space with tightly spaced tables. Meh. ",2
 I'll consider this for all corp. and personal events I put together! ,2
 Dry-aged Bone-in Ribeye was surprisingly good! I ordered it medium rare and it was spot on.  Every bite was amazing.  I didn't have too much fat I had to cut away from the steak.  The service was amazing. ,5
 Fairly expensive for the quality of steaks.  Check in at Pub/casual to get into the probably too expensive steak house. ,2
 food was outstanding super delicious my wife and I had a romantic night our server was on point with everything. and I made reservartion on phone told them we  were celebrating my wife bday and they had a special table and they gave her a bday card she was impress very awesome for them to do that and we had best table on the floor I think. plan own spending atleast 200.00 buck and sure enough it was 178.00 including drink total of 3. I wasn't disappointed at all. great experience. had good baby sitter and it was on after that. ,5
" A little pricey, but worth it for a special occasion. ",5
" I tried both Pub for lunch and the Steak restaurant for dinner.  Both places are very good.  I tried the Kobe beef burger for lunch.  The beef was very flavorful with the bacon marmalade.  The portion size was huge too.  I also had the 18 ounce dry aged rib eye for dinner.  This steak was well worth it.  Steak was properly seasoned and cooked to perfection.  I also would like to comment in the seafood appetizer where the oysters, shrimp, and king crab were very fresh and easy to eat.  These are top notched restaurants where food, service, and ambience are all there.  Highly recommend. ",5
" I didn't go to the restaurant, only the pub during HH.  It was fine, loud, fun, and expensive - 2 people, 2 beers each, and HH snack was over $60 before tip.  I'd go back, but not very often. ",4
 We were there for lunch and the music volume was too loud.  It might be fine for happy hour but difficult to talk.  Food was good and seemed priced reasonable for the location. ,4
" The food continues to be of varied quality after 3 lunch experiences in their public area and 1 private event: the wagyu burger while ordered medium was served ala hockey puck :-(  a real shame to do that to what should have been a wonderful cut of meat, although frankly I couldn't truly tell the difference between it and their standard burger.  The fries were aggressively salty but crisp and tasty.  The duck spring rolls were very flavorful but greasy.  The waitress was very sweet but disappeared at the end of the meal. ",2
" We had an excellent date.  Be prepared as the entrees range from $24-89 each.  The wine and bourbon list was amazing.  They even carry magnums of many wines and champagne.  For 2 apps, a salad,  3 drinks, and dinner we spent $179 plus tip. ",5
 could use a larger wine selection on the pricey side need to work out a few kinks....service ,4
 Our waitress is excellent. ,4
" Nice addition to the Palo Alto restaurant scene.  Located on the backside of Stanford Shopping Center next to Tootsie's, the wonderful lunch place, Vino Enoteca serves great Italian food.  The menu is not huge, but the entrees we had were excellent, the service responsive and friendly and the decor subdued.  Even with many diners, the high ceilings keep the noise level down so conversation with your table mates is easy.  We had vegetarian entrees and enjoyed our meal very much.  We will return to explore more of the menu. ",5
" The food was tasty, but portions were small for the price.  We got the small house salads which were a few bites of greens with dressing.  I am not advocating for larger portions, but slightly lower prices would have been reasonable and would result in a more enthusiastic recommendation on my part. ",3
 Excellent food! ,5
" Vino Enoteca is almost fabulous.....but while the pasta is excellent (homemade), and the impossible burger is delicious,  the bread is outstanding, it is slightly overpriced by about $2-3. per entree.  Service is friendly, but not wonderful.   The food needs to be better to make me really want to go back. ",4
" Good food as far as it went.  But a rather limited menu and high prices makes it a place I won't visit very often.  My mushroom ravioli had a total of 6 pieces; it clearly was a 'primi' size, though the other pasta dishes people got were much more substantial.  Not sure how you're supposed to know that in advance. Wine list is a bit crazy.  There are some lesser known Italian reds available for under $70, but not much you would likely know about.  Basic chiantis and Montepulcianos start in the $90 range and go up from there.  BYO wine; even with their $25 corkage fee it's a way better deal. ",3
 Didn’t particularly like the lighting in the restaurant. It was very white vs. orange and warm like your normal high end Italian restaurant or steakhouse. The food was cooked well but I think the flavoring was lacking. ,3
" Our table wasn’t ready so we were sent to the bar. Once we were seated we were ignored for 10-15 minutes until my husband got up and went to the hostess stand to request that someone take our order. The noise level is high but not so high that you can’t talk. Now for the good part - the space is very attractive. It is warm while still being modern and hip. The serveware is beautiful. The cocktails are inventive and delicious. I had the EVOO martini and it was perfect. The food is really wonderful. The fried octopus was perfectly crispy and enhanced by a delicate pesto sauce. I had lamb stuffed pasta in a creamy sauce that was rich but not sickening. If they could improve the service issues, it would have been a 5 star evening. ",4
" The food was quite good, but the NOISE made it very difficult to make conversation at our table for 4. ",4
 The food came out cold and the fish was rubbery. The staff was very nice and they remade our food. ,3
" Had a group reservation, and members of our group all arrived different times.  We arrived first, and the host wouldn't seat us.  He led us to the bar.  When our reservation time came, host came back to get us.  Unfortunately, our group was led to a room where there was a long table with an even bigger group.  The problem with the room is the sound acoustics.  It was so loud that we really had to almost yell in our conversation.  Fortunately, the host recognized this and actually came back to offer us a different table. Now that is what you call getting taken care of.  Our waiter was utmost courteous through out our dining experience. The only two negatives were not offering fresh parmigiano reggiano over my pasta, and if I would like another cocktail (I would).  Food wise, nothing reminded us of our visits to Italy.  When you are in Palo Alto, you know prices are going to be higher.  One could only hope the food is worthy of the price charge.  So that was a downer. ",2
 Very loud. Mediocre food for a high price. Won’t be going back ,2
" We waited past our reservation time to be seated. Waiter took over 15 minutes to take even a drink order. After we ordered, the food did arrive in a timely manner. Excessive noise made it difficult for four people to chat with each other.   We had asked for a quiet table when we made the reservation.  We will not return. ",3
" The food was very good, especially the pastas.  But the noice leave was terrible!!  It was so noisy that we could not hear anything that was being said by our friends on the opposite side of the table.  The whole time we had to strain and continually repeat our conversation.  Unfortunately, even though the food was very good, I doubt we will go back.  There are too many other good restaurants in the area to spend such an uncomfortable time. ",1
 A genuine Italian is hard to find in the Bay Area. This is the place! ,5
" An off-night, obviously: my agnolotti pasta was thick and gluey, the sauce somewhat cloying. Appetizer was heavy on potatoes, fried polpo (not grilled), and somewhat tough. My husband's squid ink (nero) pasta was oddly reheated, so that some pasta was cold while other sections were glued together and brittle. Service was frenzied, with one waiter running from table to table. Very crowded and, as others have mentioned, the high ceiling means that you can barely hear across the tiny tables for two. This was a significant change from previous dining experiences here, and very disappointing (and expensive). ",2
" Starting with the Bloody Mary in the mini glass. Very uninspiring, none of the customary condiments in the drink. Really pathetic!!  Pellegrino only available in 1 letter bottles , not convenient when you only want a glass. Had to ask the waiter for bread. Food was okay. Friendly service, nice decor. ",3
 Awesome! Polipo; carpaccio; zuppa; meringa di limone; OMG! ,5
 Great service and delicious food and wine. We had a lovely Nebbiolo and the impossible burger. Amazing ,5
" First time for a group of 8 of us.  Food was very good.  Read reviews beforehand and was concerned about the service comments.  We were very pleased to have excellent service.  If there was a problem, the restaurant is fixing it.  Definitely make reservations.  The bolognese was very tasty!  Have to come back for the Italian desserts - panna cotta, granita, semi freddo. ",4
 It was a very good Italian dinner.  The portions we a little on the small size but good if you are not particularly hungry and wanted a good dinner.  The ambiance was quiet and un-rushed.  There were a fair amount of women there--groups and tables for two which usually point to a quieter and not threatening environment.  I liked it.  I will go back again soon! ,5
" Extremely disappointing menu. We were a party of 6. 4 adults, 2 teenage boys. Way overpriced. Portion sizes for entrees were ridiculously small.  Beautiful restaurant but we were disappointed with the food. Left hungry. We will not be back. ",2
" Some dishes were great, some just OK. Very loud. I guess I need to write more because the review must be 50 characters long to be accepted. ",4
" The homemade pastas are the stars here. They never disappoint. Nor do the cocktails served by the excellent and knowledgeable bartenders. The Manhattan alone is worth the visit.  We’ve tried several appetizers, enjoyed the pumpkin/squash soup especially. Prosciutto and pear was delicious, although prosciutto portion was very small and not enough for the abundant pear. We disliked the impossible meat items, would not order again.  Tried the pizza this visit, as an appetizer. Had the  Emiliana. Not a lot of flavor. Then realized there was no prosciutto on the pizza. (What is it with prosciutto here?) Eventually, our sever  brought us a plate full and removed $21 from our bill. Very kind.  Finally, the pasta. Every time we’ve been here, the pastas have been excellent. All homemade, it just doesn’t get much better. We’ve tried all of the pastas, including the delectable new mushroom filled pyramids, and all are outstanding. We’ve also enjoyed the suggested wine pairings from their well-edited wine list; excellent.  Come for the pasta, start with a cocktail, ask the knowledgeable wait staff for guidance re food and wine and you will have a delightful experience at Vina.  One more thing. While the hostess is warm and welcoming, the managers seem less so. Even when standing in front of them at the desk waiting to check in, neither spoke to or acknowledged us. I’d prefer a warmer welcome; something on the order of “hello” or “welcome to Vina” would do. ",4
 Had never been here and came because we couldn’t get reservation at last minute at usual place. Good food but portions are small and prices are mid-high. Carpaccio was really nice but overall it lacks that little something to make you say “go here”. We had three for sinner st about table and all reached the same consensus. ,3
 Menu revamped since my last experience about a year ago. Food is now outstanding and authentically Italian. Service is attentive and low-key. I will certainly return soon. ,5
" Good food, tables and seats were not great, good service ",4
 The food was fantastic.  Loved the baby octopus appetizer too.  All of our meals were really tasty and we all had a different meal! ,5
 The food was average and a little overpriced ,3
" Delicious, fresh food; fast, friendly service. We will be back often! ",5
" outstanding pasta.....entrees were good, not great.... because of simple unseasoned/unsauced preparation[my wife had the cod, i had the lamb].......but perfectly cooked....excellent italy-oriented wine list......very good service.......large and attractive bar area....very noisy when full.....real ,very pleasant, italian owner......decor ok......would repeat ",4
" Food generally excellent. Waiter got our order wrong but I did not want to penalize him by correcting it, thus $35 extra for unwanted food. ",3
 Perfect place to celebrate my birthday with my sons.  Paccieri pasta is divine.  So is the polpo appetizer.   Very professional wait staff.  Not too intrusive. ,4
" A lovely discovery, it was busy at first but overall very nice experience. I’d love to return. ",5
" The service we received was not great. There was a large holiday party happening at the time we dined here, so perhaps that had something to do with it. Appetizer arrived before the drinks, which is a bit of a pet peeve of mine. Dinner course arrived before appetizer was finished, another pet peeve. Requested a second round of drinks at the time the mains arrived; second round of drinks arrived well after the meal was finished. Kitchen was moving way too fast and the bar was moving way too slowly--clearly the server wasn't communicating with either very well. We sat for about 30 minutes waiting for the check to arrive before flagging someone down. We sat for another 15-20 minutes waiting for someone to take our card. I was so annoyed while waiting to get out of there, I filled out the customer comment card that came with the bill. It was just an unpleasant dining experience. The food itself was fine, but nothing spectacular. ",3
 Delicious handmade pasta and locally sourced ingredients! Would definitely recommend. ,5
 Love this restaurant. Always accommodating to gauge meal to the time you have. Fabulous. ,5
" This was our third visit, and it did not disappoint. We've yet to have a bad dish here. We love eating here because I have as many great options as a vegetarian as does my meat-eating husband -- and all are equally creative and delicious! ",4
 need more extensive menu...very disappointing.  reception gals on the snobby side. ,2
" Strange experience: my friend and I walked in without a reservation at 5pm last Saturday.  They said they had no available tables, but encouraged us to go to the bar.  We walked through the absolutely empty restaurant area and went to the bar.  I took out my device and made an Opentable reservation for 5:15 (many future times were available).  Then we walked back to the front desk and asked to be seated.  ""Of course!  Right this way!"".     I don't know if this is a ""policy"" (let's give our patrons the message that they had better make a reservation because we want them to think we are really popular on a Saturday evening) or a glitch.  Surely we weren't immediately seated because we were two women.  But, in retrospect, it made us feel like they did not want our business.  Maybe we should have walked out and they would have lost the $140+ we spent.   When we left at about 7, the restaurant was busy, but there were some empty tables.  Our waiter was excellent and we enjoyed the Mercante cocktails and the tasty Porchetta.    I wish the restaurant would manage their reservations better.  Value your customers, please.  If you don't want walk-ins, advertise that only parties with reservations will be seated at dining tables.   Sounds like a stupid way to do business, though. ",2
" We had a very good lunch.  I did not know of this restaurant even though it has been open for over a year.  It is nice to have a good, authentic Italian restaurant in the area.  Food and service were very good.  It is very loud (too loud) due to the high ceilings and hard floors. ",5
" Very good food, great service, quiet place. I would recommend it to everyone who appreciate casual restaurant with excellent food. ",5
" This review is based on one dining experience and one drinks experience.  Drinks: We stopped in while waiting to meet a friend.  We ordered a call shot and a ""Top Shelf Margarita"" (as described in the drinks menu) that was supposed to come with a Grand Marnier float.  The drinks were NOT prepared behind the bar where we sat but out in the kitchen.  We had no way of knowing whether the whiskey was the brand called or whether the Top Shelf Margarita was prepared with specified top shelf ingredients. There was no visible sign of the Grand Marnier float.  The practice of preparing cocktails out of sight of the customer is completely unacceptable.  Brunch:  Three of us found the food indifferent.  Huevos Rancheros were not in a pool of ranchero sauce as is usually the case.  Rather, a heavy sauce was spread to the edge of the tortillas.  Fresh berry crepes were prepared using packaged crepes-- dry and cold.  UGH!  The corned beef hash was acceptable.    We ate inside and there were lots of kitchen smells circulating in the dining area. ",3
 I have been patronizing Dinah's Poolside for 35 years now!!! I always refer people and it is a 3-4 time a year poolside breakfast tradition!!! The ingredients are fresh and high quality!!! I love omelette's and the omelette's today are delicious!!! There used to be an option to build your own omelette...I would love to have that option again!!! Our servers were excellent!!! ,5
" While this is a restaurant for a small hotel the food is head and shoulders above most, even at high end locations.  Food was well prepared and reasonably priced, with large portions. The dining room was quiet and there were tables beside the pool for warmer days. We live nearby and will definitely be back. ",5
 We come here for brunch often.  Service is always excellent and there is a nice selection of food.  It is consistently good.  We enjoy sitting outside by the pool area when the weather is warm and inside by the fireplace during the holidays. ,4
 Worked for me! ,5
" Don't let the hotel poolside location deter you. Excellent food,solid service. Definitely would return. ",5
 We were promptly seated in a good spot.  The service was very good.  I ordered Sourdough French toast that was delicious.  The orange juice was pricey but good.  All in all a good experience. ,5
" We overall had a really fantastic brunch experience, hard to believe we have been driving past this place for years and never tried it.  The pros: Sunny weekend brunch was beautiful poolside, and the gardens are delightful - take some time to walk around back little pond after eating. our 2 vegan dining friends requested modifications to breakfast burrito and they LOVED the veggie burrito that came out said it was delicious. My Hash browns were perfection-crispy! The cons: they were pretty swamped and so a bit of a lag in service time which was ok and understandable, but other oversights like completely forgetting to give us silverware. Our salmon omelettes were pretty good but had way too much onion filler inside- I don't expect it to be filled w salmon but some other veggie would have been more palatable than tons of onion. Peets coffee did not taste real great- maybe too watery? parking was a bit tight Overall we enjoyed ourselves despite wait and glitches and will be back ",3
" What an awesome little place! Great food and great service! A little slow at the end (getting check), but other than that our waiter was very good! ",5
 We came to a slow Sunday evening after dinner hour and the service was so well done.  The food came fast and fresh.  It was a great night out.  We were able a pleasant conversation in a quiet environment.  The bar area had a game going on television but that was nicely separate from the dining area.  Nice dining experience. ,5
" Our favorite place for breakfast on the weekends. We love the staff, most have been there quite some time and it never disappoints. Comfort  food 101! ",4
 Service so slow.  Literally had to leave the table twice to ask for water/wine. ,4
 Everything about the café makes the guests feel like they are welcome family members of the owners or workers.  The staff is happy to customize meals to satisfy the guests in a way that makes it seem effortless.  This place is a gem tucked away in a beautiful setting far from the madding crowd. ,5
 Good food for a relaxed brunch. Great service. Excellent margaritas. ,4
 Absoluvwry enjoyable. Wish I had the servers name he was absolutely the BEST!  Food and everything else was superb. They even brought a birthday dessert for our guest ! ,5
" The food was quite good with many creative and healthy choices. We especially enjoyed the live music provided by Dolce Musica, a trio of two accomplished musicians and an impressive vocalist. It was a bit cool for outside dining, but a plastic curtain and heaters made it very comfortable. ",4
" Our favorite place for breakfast, brunch or lunch when in Palo Alto.  Always good food and we enjoy sitting poolside.  Been coming here for nearly thirty years.  The owner has changed and the menu has changed, but all for the better. ",5
" The poolside dining is wonderful: lots of space, no pressure to rush, beautiful ambience, simple but delicious food!  Great for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Inside dining is noisier, but the food and service are good in all locations. I would happily recommend Dinah's to families. ",5
 I love sitting outside by the pool and seeing their tropical garden.   Food has always been good. ,5
 Great relaxing place.  Love sitting around the poolside.  Had early brunch with friends.  Food and service was great.  Would definitely return. ,5
" Food was OK, beautiful, comfortable poolside location.  Grilled Octopus was excellent, but the Waygu burgers weren't as good as expected.  Also had Bacon Mac and Cheese - good, but not great.  Nice wine and cocktail selection.   We were not met by a waiter after being seated, so several tables placed orders before we met our waiter.  Once that was addressed, he was very pleasant and the rest of the dinner went smoothly. ",3
 Surprising great food in this old school motel turned hotel in Silicon Valley. Salads were excellent fresh tasty dressing. Salmon was cooked perfectly with great crispy cook. The only drawback was the uncoordinated service. Many friendly welcoming servers came to help us but not when we needed them. Sat without drinks for a long time until I flagged someone down. Three people tried to take our order after we had already given it. Super friendly but need better process for tracking tables. Still we would return. ,4
 Anniversary ,5
 Very friendly service.  Food choices are well represented with all protein sources across the board from salads to soups to entrees to desserts. ,4
" Celebrated a birthday breakfast here with family. We sat for quite a while chatting after our meal which was very enjoyable. The food was good. We've been here before and always liked what we've ordered, which has usually been more on the order of comfort food. We sat outside right near the pool where a number of families with kids were swimming. Even though they were making noise, we could easily have a nice conversation and hear each other quite well. We brought outside desserts in for the birthday which they plated and served very nicely. Service could have been a bit quicker, but I'm not sure they had enough servers for the number of patrons. Overall, it was a very pleasant morning, and I'd go back and sit by the pool again when the weather was good. ",4
" The food was very good, as well as the wine. The only recommendation I'd do, is if we are indoors, please, don't serve plastic glasses for wine.  Thanks ",4
" My group of 5 friends met here for Sunday brunch. I had a made a reservation way in advance. There was a wait if you didn't have one. The setting was nice. We were outside under the shade, perfect temperature and nice surroundings. Not too loud, we could talk and hear each other. The food was average, not bad, not amazing. Service was a bit slow and they only split the check up to 4 credit cards so we ended up putting it on one. The woman who informed us seemed visibly annoyed by this. ",3
 Excellent American food. Service was a little lackadaisical -- had to flag down another server to get bread. Nice to sit at poolside on a mild evening. Excellent American food with a few Asian dishes in the mix. ,5
 noise level varies with seating - patio can be noisy with large group.  Side room is usually very quiet.  Staff is very pleasant  Good value ,4
 I am still trying to figure out how they cooked the salmon (crispy on the outside and perfectly tender on the inside)!!!  A true gem and a gastronomic experience.  You will not regret it. ,5
" We have been to Dinah's multiple times recently.  We keep bringing  our friends  so they, too, can experience the  beauty and quiet that makes Dinah's so special here in Silicon Valley.    The food and service  are wonderful  and the music on Thursday evenings during the summer will enchant you. ",5
" Wow, great brunch. They reserved a large quiet table for us as I'd mentioned it was a special occasion. Great food and service, thanks! ",5
 Always a pleasure dining poolside at Dinah's! Good and plentiful food. Animal friendly. ,4
 Birthday!! Drinks were great and appetizers. Love sitting by the pool in the shade. Everyone's meal was excellent. ,4
 Great environment. ,4
 I've been going to Dinah's for over 30 years.   A lot has changed but the food is still great.   Service is quite slow which is fine for a leisurely  Brunch.  They probably need more servers on the weekends. ,4
" our 2nd visit and the food was great but service was so-so, mostly the kitchen that couldn't get my order correct and it took a long time to get it fixed.  but we'll be back, it was good. ",4
 Very nice place !! ,4
 I really love Dinah's!  It has become my go to breakfast place when visiting my son and other Bay Area friends near Stanford.  The place is really lovely and relaxing both indoors and out.  I have always had great service.  And the corned beef hash and pulled pork skillet are to die for.    Will be back many times! ,5
 Perfect experience. Avonna was an amazing bartender.  Sushi so fresh.  Great dj. ,5
" This restaurant is attached to the DoubleTree Hotel. It's not bad for a hotel restaurant, but be aware that you're going to a hotel restaurant. Looks newly redesigned/renovated. Bar looks like it's probably pretty fun and there are tvs all over the walls. But it's not really a family dinner type of atmosphere/place.  Sounds like a member of their staff went on break unexpectedly, so the food came out slowly and in a weird order, but the waitress and manager were nice and tried their best to explain and deal with the issue. We never got any bread though. I didn't have the right expectation for this restaurant. The restaurant tried and it was a decent place. Burgers, fish n' chips, etc. type of food seem to be the best deal and are super tasty looking. My grandma got the fish and chips, which was really great! Other food is OK, but slightly pricey. ",2
 I met my cousin here as it was central to her home and my hotel in San Jose. First time we'd seen each other in 30 years. We had a quiet and intimate booth in which we could catch up! Great service and the food was pretty good! ,5
" Good food, but service is very slow. Very loud when full. ",3
" Waitress was attentive.  We ordered the fish and chips.  While the portion was ample, the fish was near burned and was dry.  The bread was also over baked and hard to cut.  We paid 30 for a cup of coffee, a salad, and an entree.  Pretty pricy for the quality. ",2
" We  Came here for birthday with reservations,  when we mention it to the lady at the front, they don't even know that we have reservations, had to talk to 3 different people about our reservations , seems disorganized about their reservations and finally the manager talk to us , and we request for table by the band , he told us we can't and we have to come early if we want to take that table ( but we have reservations, duhh and no one was sitting there) overall the food was okay, our waitress not bad , but I'm not sure we'll come back here. ",1
 Long lines and ok food.  Way too expensive for the food options.  Cashiers in buffet allowed people they know to skip the long line. ,1
" Overall the brunch on Mother's Day was a great value. The food was great, the service was great. The one thing that was most disappointing was when we got there for our 1230 reservation, there was already at least 35-40 people ahead of us in line. The line was to pay before the meal, tax and tip included, before you got seated.  This could have gone a lot faster if better organized. We were not seated until 1:00 and I was with someone who could not stand or walk, so this was a bit awkward having to wait in a line for a half hour. ",5
" Very good food, the sushi was great and the steak from the 1600 degree broiler was amazing. Airline chicken breast and double cut pork chop were excellent also. The food is worth the trip alone. ",3
 Outstanding Easter Brunch. Lots of different kinds of delicious food choices. The bunny walking around visiting the kids and taking pictures with them was a nice touch. I highly recommend it. ,5
" Horrible food - salad was brown, salmon came rare, sent back and new one came back with horrible stink smell (old) waitress was very nice, bread was good. ",3
 We had been wanting to try this place since the hotel changed to the Doubletree and the restaurant became Bistro 880 so we made reservations for Valentine's dinner. The remodel is modern and comfortable with lots of tv's for bar dining. The tables were set romantically with candlelight and chocolates and live piano music in the background. The price fixed menu had great selections and everything we had was delicious! A great value and a memorable experience! ,4
 Evenings was very quiet and the service on time and friendly and helpful. ,5
" We celebrated the New Year's Eve there and everything was pretty okay except for the billing. We were charged more than what we expected. It was a fine dining set for a fix price excluding gratuity and tax (which is normal).  But when we got our bill there is additional ""surcharge"" that we don't know what is that for. I hate hidden charges!!! ",2
" The overall experience was less than memorable. Food was mediocre, service was very poor. I would not recommend to anyone to attend an event at this location. For the price my family and I were expecting a memorable night but it was far from it. Will not be returning. ",1
" Everything else is great except the music  I don't need to explain you should be able to figure it out how many people came and how much you made last year compare to this year, music very importance , I hope its better next year ",3
" WOW , THE PLACE TO BE , GREAT SERVICE, FUN PEOPLE , the  remodel looks modern and fresh. The 880 club bistro manager Susan and her staff know what it takes for a flawless evening of dinning and dance . ",5
 The food was way over priced for the NYE dinner and it was not good at all! I was very disapointed ,3
" Not too creative with dishes.  Maybe a few steps above bar food.  Quality was not bad but selection was not appropriate to name of Bistro.  Calamari, burger, flat bread pizza..etc you get the drift.  May go back for a quick business type lunch but not too impressed i am sorry. ",3
" We went for a business lunch - turned out we were the only ones there. Even with an Open Table reservation, there was a sign up that said ""Closed"". We went to the front desk of the hotel and they contacted someone to seat us - it took a long time. No one else came in the entire time we were there. It took ages to get our order taken, and service after that was VERY spotty. On the upside, the food, once it arrived, was very good - both taste and presentation - the only downside is that we were not asked how we wanted the burger done. It came medium well - we would have preferred medium. It was certainly quiet - if you want a good place for a business lunch where you won't be disturbed and if you don't mind waiting or being almost totally ignored, this is the place. ",2
" The restaurant was disappointing when compared to the Yelp listing. I thought this was going to be a quaint bistro with an interesting menu. Not so. It was a hotel restaurant. The service was great with a nice atmosphere, but the menu was ho-hum. Not much for vegetarians. ",3
" In the Doubletree hotel, better than most for a hotel restaurant ",3
" The place inside was gorgeous however it was empty for a Saturday night. it was my Birthday Dinner, there were a couple of meals that were returned Steak and burger.  The table near us, received a desert with candle and I told the receptionist that I was celebrating a Birthday. Didn't receive anything.  The music started at 9:00 pm and I must say it was next to the dinning area, and seemed very odd. The server was one for 10 people, yet the place was EMPTY in the Dining area.  The server disappeared so often it was tough to ask questions get refills on water order drinks.  Not to mention the music was HORRIBLE, some of the workers said the same. (house music of some sort) To charge the additional  amount of $10.00 a person for very small area and horrible music isn't acceptable.  I thought the charge was for a dance floor and much darker area (very bright there for a club scene) I chose to drive out to foster city (Crown Plaza) and pay $10.00 per person.  Had a blast! ",2
" We were surprised to know they had a $10 cover charge per person, which was not worth it at a place like this due to their very limited drink and food menu.  I had the worse pina colada I've ever had and the  warm chocolate molten cake was more on the cold side. ",1
 There are good TVs and a good bar.  It looks nice.  Food was ok.  Folks working there were very nice. Not very busy. ,3
 The place was very nice inside the hotel. Friendly service and good food ,3
" Four beers and three hamburgers totaled $80 - and were nothing special at all.  Our server had most of his teeth and spoke passable English, but he ignored our need for water or for a bill and appeared to have about three different jobs as he also seemed to be a cook and a behind the bar worker.   This place is located in a Doubletree hotel, it has lots of TVs on and is working a  business model that I'd call ""take the business man's per dium"".  There is no reason to go here for drink or food unless you're staying at the Doubletree and already have a couple DUIs. ",2
" We checked the website before making reservations and liked what we saw.  When we arrived at the restaurant the menu was not the same.  It was actually pretty boring menu.  The appetizers were excellent but the main dishes were meh.  Wide, flat noodles drowned in a flavorless Alfredo sauce with 4 shrimp.  Over priced.  The mixed drinks were generous and strong.  Music from the bar was in background but not obtrusive.  We stayed to dance and the DJ played endless sets at a comfortable volume and good dance beat. Overall, would go back but probably not for dinner.  Drinks , appetizers, and dancing. ",3
 Overall it was nice for a hotel restaurant. It's very open which can be both good and bad. Food was decent. They had issues with our check in so I have yet to receive the points (which is the main reason we went here!). If I get the points we may visit again. ,3
 Great eats but you feel a definite hotel/airport ambience. ,3
" Upon arrival for a business dinner, we were told by the bartender that someone in the restaurant would help us.  The restaurant was completely empty and no staff visible.  We waited for 15 minutes and no one from the staff appeared and no additional diners came.  I was deeply disappointed and embarrassed in front of my guests.  Luckily, there was a Japanese Steakhouse within walking distance that was able to accommodate us and the evening was salvaged. ",1
" Fantastic food with excellent service!  I love the ""flights"" of different foods to try.  Our table for two was awkwardly cramped between other tables, but it was a busy Saturday night.  I'll definitely be back for another special date night. ",5
" Tucked away in a strip mall this was unexpectedly pleasant. Great place to catch up with friends over a glass of wine. Loved the tables and seating and the glasses and plates, lots of thought to make it all a bit special.  Only thing that spoils it is the Tv's. This is trying so hard to be a classy,  sophisticated wine bar and not a sports bar but then there are three Tv's  - failed! ",4
" The exterior may make it look like it is a cafe that sells Vietnamese sandwiches, but the ambiance was great. Nice decor. Live jazz band was amazing and set the mood for a classy yet laid back date. ",4
" Our group visited Flight a year or two ago.  We really enjoyed it.  This visit was good, but not as good as the previous visit.  I had made a reservation through Open Table but they knew nothing about it.  Not a problem as they were not busy at 6pm on a Tuesday.  They left the door open so it was a bit cool at our table.  We ordered a variety of foods, glasses of wine and wine cocktails and they were all good.  We also had dessert.  The waitress neglected to clear about half of the table before dessert so I ate my sundae next to my plate with shrimp tails on it.   Not really appealing.  The other visit we made there we had much more professional service.  I will go back and hope for better service, but the economy is good and it is probably difficult to staff small places like this. ",4
 We have been to Flight at least 3 times and always find their wine flights to be a good find. They do change their wine menu every couple of weeks so you may not find your wine of choice from a previous visit! Good food pairing options with your wine and exceptional service. We will come back for sure. ,4
" Great wine - we tried some new wines and loved them! We also God a couple appetizers and they were good - tasty and nice presentation. The ""but"" to this place is that we had HORRIBLE service. They opened at 4pm and we walked in at 4:01pm. The girl working did not greet us or say hello...  she said ""I'm not open yet."" We sat and waited about 8 minutes for her to greet us and take our order and when she finally did it was with an attitude like we weren't welcome there. Really too bad b/c it could be a great spot with (much) better service! ",3
 The food was good.  The service was poor.  It took 15  minutes for our table of 6 to all get our food once it started coming out. ,3
 This is a great new place for us. Definitely going back. ,5
 Servers are not knowledgeable of wine nor the cheeses and the cured meats at all. Wine selection was boring. ,2
" We had a great time dining at Hoffmans. The waiter service was great and we thank him for his generosity, humor and personable nature. Food was delicious and we think Hoffman serves some of the best fries we ever tasted! Thanks again for a great night, ",5
 Always solid and consistent home cooked deliciousness.  It's like eating a wonderful home cooked meal with great service and amazing value.  Love this place! ,4
" This was our first time dining here. There were four of us and each of us ordered a different entree. We all enjoyed our entrees including the hamburger, pork, steak, clam chowder.  It was quiet enough to talk with friends and a great find and close walk to the The Marsh Theatre on Valencia. We will definitely be back! ",5
 We brought friends for dinner. All of us enjoyed our delicious dinners.  Less noisy than other places and very warm and welcoming. ,5
 Just an exceedingly talented chef.   Lovely. ,5
" Very nice neighborhood restaurant.  Salads are wonderful, but too salty.  We especially like the hamburgers and the sodas they make. The staff has always been warm and friendly. ",5
 We had a great time. Calem is a PROFESSIONAL. ,5
" Our second time coming here in a week.   A quiet time of the year, but this place is a gem.  Food is excellent and the ambiance is friendly and low-key.  Cudos to chef Karen Hoffmann. ",5
 The food was great and the staff were very friendly. ,5
 Unicorns may have been sacrificed to make tonight’s butternut squash ravioli.  Pure heaven. ,4
" Love the location and the food but the service is truly superb, good people! ",4
" Waiter was terrible. Asked for bread and nothing for 20 minutes. He overheard us talking about the wait and said, “I was going to get you bread but decided to wait.” Um, what??? Yes, he literally said those exact words! ",3
" Beautifully prepared whole chicken, but I think the brisket may have stolen the show. And the pate... YUM! ",5
 Good food executed well . Not fussy. Local ingredients. ,4
" I love Hoffman's. The food is delicious and  is presented perfectly, without any fussiness but elegantly and  simply. I had been before- this was my second time- and I'll definitely go back after having chosen it as the place to celebrate my seventieth birthday with friends. ",5
" This place has potential..  The server was pretty oblivious in terms of the reaction of the food being ""okay"".   Brussel sprouts were overcooked and mushy!   We LOVE our veggies, but we couldn't even finish the rest of the bowl.  I wish the server was attentive and considerate enough to have left this off our bill.  Instead, he realized he missed it and charged us for this bland and unappetizing dish.  My duck was great, the polenta was nicely done but the greens were SO bitter, I couldn't even finish it.  I was HIGHLY disappointed paying what I paid for this sub-par meal. ",2
 Great food and great service. Will be back soon. Thanks! ,5
 Always great food and friendly service. Awesome neighborhood spot! ,5
" Had a great dinner, nice atmosphere, good noise level. ",5
" Love this place in every way. The servers and chef/owner(s) convey the sense that we're esteemed guests in their home. The food is simply scrumptious (delicious as plated and also accommodating requested modifications), there's a terrific array of beverages (loved both the wine the server recommended and my son's ""house-made"" mango soda); the folks there tonight seemed truly enjoy kids (so refreshing, especially as our city is shifting demographically); and it's an incredibly relaxed, comfortable atmosphere. My new favorite joint. ",5
" Excellent food! Love the rotisserie chicken and brisket, as well as the salads, mussels and yummy side dishes.  AND the music is phenomenal :-) ",5
 The bistro steak complimented by gaufrettes and fried peppers was superb.  The monkfish in saffron sauce outstanding. ,5
 We enjoyed everything from start to finish! Nice atmosphere too and friendly service. ,5
" We really liked everything about Hoffman's.  Service was very nice and non-intrusive.  I think our server was Chris.  Very attentive and respectful.  I like this type of food.  Comforty, hearty, flavorful.  Had the chicken, kale caesar, pork loin, squash blossoms, mussels, cheesecake and peach crumble.  I loved my pork loin.  Seasoned well, cooked perfectly.  Came with red potatoes and haricoverts.  Mixed with the rich sauce was very yum.    Great neighborhood spot with a friendly staff and good food at reasonable prices for SF. ",4
" Consistently interesting seasonal sides, great vegetables and fantastic chicken as well as other options for main dishes ",5
 Awesome people great service. ,5
" We had the beef brisket and the pasta special.  I loved the warm potato salad and broccolini served with the beef, and the beef was very tasty but also very fatty for my taste. I will probably order a different entree next time. Our server was very helpful with the beer list and with our menu questions. We loved the service and will definitely return. ",5
" I exposed my friends to another great restaurant with good food, good service &amp; good wine. We had the romaine salad, steak &amp; rotisserie chicken with a side of the roasted cauliflower. Dessert was a peach crumble with ice cream on top. All were DELICIOUS!! Our server was very pleasant and patient with us since 3/4 were newbies! And you can't beat the nice welcome when greeted by the owner at the door! Thanks, Chef!! I plan to expose more friends to this quaint size spot in the Mission! ",5
 Absolutely amazing food and desert!!!! ,5
" The food was very good. Like far too many restaurants today, the server lacked manners and any understanding of how to serve graciously.  Before some of our group of four finished eating the server started cleaning plates and disrupted the mood of a pleasant meal. This continued with the waiter interrupting our meal by removing plates as they became empty until I finally told him to stop. There is no excuse for this lack of manners. ",4
" Offering just what it says, Hoffmann's menu offers grilled and rotisserie meats. But they also bring out good side orders and specials. The 1/2 chicken was succulent, a little salty, and accompanied with tasty small cooked onions and potatoes. Decent wine and beer list. I'll go back, but with so many restaurants in the neighborhood, it may be a while. ",4
" Solid. Real neighborhood spot for locals.  Lovely staff, consistently great food. ",5
" Reliably thoughtful and friendly service. Menu choices contains both regularly available great dishes (like the grilled romaine salad, or the brisket), and rotating specials that are often tempting. The payed attention to acoustics, so the place can be pretty full of people and you can still hear your companion talk. ",4
" One of my favorite restaurants in SF, and definitely a hidden gem. Hoffman's is a little on the pricey side, but you're paying for great food and good service. ",5
 Great food and a very nice server made for a great experience. ,5
 Service was great but slow.  Food was very salty and we tried almost everything on the menu. Likely won't go back again sadly. ,3
 Great food (omg the spare ribs) - great wine. OK service and only OK atmosphere.   Dessert is A+  Overall a lovely evening out. Will be back despite shortcomings. ,4
" Great rotisserie, inventive menu, service and ambiance. ",5
 Great food for a reasonable price.  Super friendly staff and good location. ,4
" A superb meal. Hoffman's my new fave, hands down.  Sure, the ambience is neighborhood diner, not fancy. But that's okay. Bummer there's no full bar, but wine list good.  It's the food, the stunningly-flavored food.  Such talent. ",5
" Came here to hang out with some friends and enjoy the night out but as soon as we entered it was one disaster after another. We didn't know about the seating arrangements and nothing was mentioned on the website so we were seated at a low table. The table was so low you had to hunch to eat. When we asked the person that seated us if we could sit at one of the higher tables, she lied and said I called her and requested the seats. She  lied about me calling her and changing the time and number of people even though I reserved through OpenTable. She just kept lying through her teeth and made no accommodations to change this.   When we were seated a waitress came and explained to us the rules regarding wing Wednesday. You had to buy 2 drinks/items per person in order to get .25 cent wings. When only one of us wanted to get this, the waiter seemed mad and kept clicking her pen. She made it seem like we had to order wings or we couldn't eat here.   The menu was limited and pricey. The portions were small and not worth the price. The chicken was extremely dry even with the sauce. The next day both my friend and I's stomach was hurting.  Overall I would not recommend this restaurant. Was excited to try out this restaurant but just became a bad experience. The person who seated us and the waitress ruined our night. Thankfully another waiter served our food and he was friendly and helpful. ",2
" Great food! Really nice, fun people. Family owned restaurant.  We will certainly be back.   If you like lamb,  this is your place. It was divine. ",5
" My partner and I went during happy hour and were blown away by the food. Their wings, poke' and sides are amazing and it's rare to see so many Kona Brewing beers on tap outside the islands! ",5
" fun place, great atmosphere. place is big enough for large groups but make sure to make reservations to be safe. Seems like almost every month i'm going to a friend's birthday here since they can accommodate groups of 20+. Not sure on the pricing but they offer buffet style catered food for larger groups.   Cocktails are a reasonable price. try the Island Mule and Strawberry Mojito. For food, you cant miss with the Pa'ina Wings. On Wednesdays you can get them for 25 cents as well as other flavors! Spammie and Loco Moco is a must since this is a Hawaiian restaurant (recently i just discovered you can order Fried Spammies that is off the menu). The beef in the Shaking Beef is really tender. ",5
" great place for happy hour. came here for an after work happy hour and had a great time. place is huge so it's great for large groups.  the food and drinks came out fast and the waitress was attentive. We ordered almost everything on the menu and can't beat half off cocktails and beers. The have a full bar so the drinkers of our group bought rounds of shots too.  I saw that they had different happy hour specials every day (taco tuesdays, wing wednesdays, bottomless mimosas, etc). Must find the time to check out these different specials! ",5
" It was open Mic that afternoon. I ordered the only vegan options--edamame, kale salad and kimchee rice. It was good! ",3
" HORRIBLE FOOD QUALITY - REHEATED, SPOILED FOOD PRODUCTS - CHIPPED PLATES - SMALL PORTIONS - AWFUL POKE - POOR REPRESENTATION OF POLYNESIAN FUSION FARE ",1
 Mom asked for a bar to watch the warriors game at and this place delivered. Good food and great energy from other warriors fans. She loved all the dishes we ordered. ,5
 The pics were better than the actual taste of the food. I wouldn't come back for the food alone but would check out the venue for future reggae concerts. Appreciated the prompt service though. I don't think reservations were necessary as the place wasn't that full on a Friday night. ,3
" Food, drinks and service were outstanding. It's a great value, particularly on Tuesday's and Wednesdays. My only suggestion would be less TVs (on). People really weren't watching them, when we were there anyway. ",4
" Our servers were impeccable and the food was great. The chicken and waffles dish was over the top fantastic.  Everything that we tried was good, even the drinks. ",5
 We went here because of it's convenient location to the movie theatre.  The place was barely seated but our service was ridiculously slow. They were out of several menu items which is odd.  There were a lot of severs just standing around talking. The food was nothing to note.  neither good nor bad. I barely touched my bibimbap.  and why  is there such a large pile of shredded lettuce under the macaroni salad?  I think this place might be best as a place to get drunk and watch sports on the many large TV screens and not so much for dinner. ,2
" Food was great! Not sure if it's because we were a large party, but service was not so great... Not only did they forget several orders, the food was brought out staggered over 2 hours. Some people enjoyed their full meal, and others were left declining to eat at all because they were sick of waiting after two hours. Someone in our party politely explained the situation to our server, and they knocked an entree or two off our bill and offered a round of drinks. A nice gesture but unfortunately too little too late. Disappointing because this was booked for my friend's birthday. Spammie was good, at least! ",3
" Always delicious! Provided a great evening out with good friends, and they were all blown away by the tasty dishes! ",5
" Good, authentic Indian food. There is a nearby parking garage as street parking is almost impossible to find. ",4
" This was my 2nd visit to Aslam's Rasoi. I was so pleasantly surprised the first time, I could not wait to return. I had the Mixed Tandoori both time. The fish and prawns especially were amazing, perfectly prepared. Loved the vegetables on which they were served. Had the roasted eggplant in addition and it was very flavorful. With a nice kick. Shall definitely return and venture to other items on the menu. ",5
 Tasty food. Great menu with many options. Serviceminded personnel. ,5
 Awesome food staff and location ,5
" The server was attentive and knowledgeable, and helped us to choose the dishes. Great food, accompanied with lassi and Indian beer. ",5
 Had an early dinner with 2 kids who only eat moderate spices. That often means bland Indian food. Not here! The best Indian food I've had outside of NY. Our waitress and the staff provided great service even bringing additional rice and raita and complimentary mango lasso. We sat at a window table looking out at the traffic on Valencia. I've found my Indian spot in SF! ,5
" Food was fantastic &amp; fresh! Never been disappointed, yet. ",4
 Try their Pakistani curry. Also try the paneer tandoori.  Absolutely delicious! ,5
" Wonderful food, terrific service, highly recommend! ",5
" The restaurant was able to accommodate our group of 8 on a Saturday night with only one day notice. Great value, great dishes, delightful dining experience! ",5
" I have been going to Aslam's Rasoi foir many years. The food was and remains fantastic. It is a lovely room which used to be timeless ,like you were in Jakarta ,Kolkata or Kathmandu which made it seem like a cool refuge in a warm country with its really high ceiling fans and arches. I really preferred the previous hand-painted , brightly colored , more beautiful and funky Indian /Hindu/Pakastani/Buddhist  decor and ambience to the attempt to attract techies with the boring flat  dull gray /somber / uninspired ""modern "" drek that now passes for San Francisco interior (removing all cultural colors &amp; symbols) . ",4
" Good, well done food. I liked the masala nimbu paani (limeade).   Slow/no service though. We were placed in a corner and no one ever came. We had to ask for water after waiting like 10 minutes. Then we had to ask for someone to come take our order. This was at 9pm on Saturday night so it was a little busy but they could have at least given us water.  They were also playing loud punjabi music. When we asked them to turn it down, they obliged so our group was thankful for that. ",4
 Love this place.  Best Indian in San Francisco.  Rec'd the chicken tikka masala and the samosas.  Sitting in the window is great for Mission people watching.  This is a family owned and run business. ,5
" We arrived at 7:15 and the restaurant was pretty quiet. We ordered our food and it arrived quickly, the staff was super friendly and attentive. We ordered the appetizer sampler, it's a bit small so I would recommend 1 for 2 people to share, we were a table of 4 so we should have ordered another, but the food came pretty quick so it wasn't an issue. We ordered the Lamb Vindaloo, Chicken Tikka, Paneer Tikka Masala, and the Chicken Tikka Masala and a side of rice to share. It was all delicious! We also ended up ordering 3 orders of the Garlic Naan, it was so good, we kept ordering more. Overall, such a cute place with delicious food. I'll definitely go back! So glad we picked this place over DOSA. ",5
" This used to be my favorite for Indian food in SF but I'm afraid i'll no longer be coming back.   The remodeled dining room was so noisy we had to yell at one another and even then it was difficult to hear. We couldn't wait to leave, the noise was so disruptive.   The food was just ok. Our tandoori chicken (a $22 dish) was over cooked and dry/chewy. The kitchen seems to have lost its passion for consistency, quality and bold flavor.   They were understaffed that night, too. It was hard to get the attention of staff to even let them know something was wrong. That was really frustrating.   The whole experience was a fail.   It is unlikely we will return. With so many Indian restaurants to choose from, I can't see risking another bad experience at Aslam's Rasoi. ",2
 Excellent food and service! Great price as well :) ,5
" Great food, probably best Indian food I had outside of India. Samosa is great! ",5
 3 waiters running the entire restaurant. ,4
" The crowd there was really happy and friendly.  Everyone joined in to sing me happy birthday, even most of the strangers. ",4
" We booked Aslam's Rasoi when our party unexpectedly grew from 6 to 10 and our planned destination couldn't accommodate a group of that size. The food was fantastic, wine was good, would highly recommend. ",5
 This was our second visit - it has gone down in regards to food - not hot in temperature particularly rice - sat out too long? Not sure I will ever return or recommend unless they improve dramatically! ,3
 They were closed even after taking my reservation. This kind of embarrassing. I reserved pretty ahead of time. ,1
" We were oveall very happy with our meal.  Our waiter was friendly and informative and helped us find some good choices that worked for us - including for our young kids.   They were a little understaffed that night, but the food was great! ",4
" First time there. Great food, great service, pleasant atmosphere. ",5
 It was very good. Would return again. ,4
 We've been to Aslam's Rasoi in the past for large parties but have never had this bad of an experience with the service before. The restaurant was maybe 50% full but the kitchen seemed to be focusing on take out orders. We had to flag waiters down every time we wanted something they were never proactive. We got our appetizers more then 10 minutes apart even though we ordered them all at once. All of our dinner was spread out over 15 minutes being brought out and we continually had to ask them to bring out our remaining food. Our last order of bread came out AFTER we had finished all of our entrees. The food was great but the service soured our entire dinner. And of course we had a party of 8 so we were automatically charged tip. Not sure we would go back with a group again. ,3
" Good food, good service and nice ambiance. Friendly atmosphere. ",4
 The restaurant smelled of very strong air freshener. The water had soap or Some kind of cleaning chemical in it. We had to reorder water and tell them To time glass well. New water was fine. ,2
 Delicious food. Loved every bite. Would def come here again whenever we visit SFO. Our server was very friendly too. He offered me couple wine to try before I could select one. ,5
 Being from London we had pretty high standards for an Indian restaurant. Raslam's was good. The lamb chops were juicy and the naan was freshly made and not too bready. The other dishes were decent. The Prawn madras was tasty but the prawns were very small and none of the curries had any vegetables in them which was a bit disappointing. I think if you're craving a curry then it's a good place to go but if you want something truly exceptional with the complexity of a real Indian/Pakistani dish then you may be disappointed. ,3
" Delicious flavor, everything we had was excellent b ",5
 Upon arrival waiter was rushy. Waited a bit the waiter to come back. Food was okay. Had bad heartburn for 3 days. ,2
 Delicious! You have to have the saag paneer. ,4
 Took a group of 11 and everything was great! The Poke is definitely the thing to get but everything we had was great. Our group included several children and they loved it. Would happily go back with a large or small group. ,5
 The Loco Moco was oh so satisfying.  Truly a comfort food.  The chicken wings were sweet-spicy and very crispy.  Delicious!  The venue was perfect for the ukulele jam we attended.  It was cozy without being crowded. ,5
" came here for a birthday and was surprised at how big the place was. There was a private event going on at the lower level and upstairs was open to the public. We sat around the island and enjoyed the food and drinks! some favorites were the spam musubi's,  pa'ina wings, kalbi bites, poke, duck breast and bone marrow. ",5
 Such a great place to get some tasty Hawaiian food. Spam on everything! And the wings have been always so awesome ,4
" Family birthday dinner, the food was delicious, I fell in LOVE with the garlic shrimp, plump, crisp and sweet. We also had poké platters, papaya salad, soft shell crab tacos, fish tacos , pork tacos and a few other dishes I didn't try because I was stuck like stoopid on the shrimp. I will be back. ",4
" Went in, ordered, water, a bottle of wine and some apps. Water came (for 2 of the 4 of us) after about 20 min. I eventually had to just go to the bar and buy a bottle of wine. Edamame came after 40 minutes. At that point, we just decided it wasn't worth it to stay and cancelled our order. I know they were busy with one large table from Uber, but it wasn't that nuts. Oh well. We'll never go back, so no reason to worry about our opinion! :) ",1
 It felt more like a bar than a restaurant. We were dining with a group of 12 with a few kids. It was very loud as there is no real separation of the bar and eating area. They have a stage so this seems like more of a place to have drinks and appetizers than dinner. Would potentially go again with friends but not a great place for family with kids. ,3
" Pa'ina is the slice of Hawaiian heaven I've been looking for. The poke is fresh and flavorful, the Kalua pork is fatty and melts in your mouth and spam!!!! I can't wait to go back ",5
 My friend and I went here to try some Hawaiian food. Poke was good and everything else was just ok. Cocktails are syrupy and simple. I don't see myself going back because there are much better options in the area. ,3
 Chicken wings and Poke were on point! ,5
" this place is a hidden gem. if you like casual food and a lively atmosphere, you should definitely check it out. the poke and the sliders were my favorite. next time i want to try their mac and cheese. ",5
" I celebrated New Year's eve dinner here lately with my best friend and ordered the Loco Moco and the Pork Ribs. The food was okay, nothing special. Having eaten at various restaurants in the city, I would rate the taste of the food here from 2 - 2.5.  I was a little disappointed with the Pork ribs, the sauce is good but when you bite on the ribs, it was bland - something is missing. It seems like the sauce is poured onto the ribs to add taste but the way it was cooked, it lack some spices on the meat itself.  The Loco Moco burger is the same, it taste like Banquet TV dinner. I think the best part was the fried banana desert with mango ice cream which is why I am giving it 2.5 stars. The service was excellent. ",3
 celebrated my birthday here with a big group of my friends. it's really hard to find somewhere as large and accommodating as Pa'ina. Serving staff was great as well as management. They even have private rooms to put all the gifts! We planned to go somewhere else to drink after dinner but we ended up staying the whole night. Will definitely be back to try their late night menu! ,5
" As much as I really wanted to love, or at least really like this restaurant the food was just so-so.  I brought a group from my office and not one person felt that their meal was anything but mediocre.  The fish tacos, which our wait staff said was her favorite, had absolutely no flavor and even squeezing several limes on it did next to nothing. We asked for hot sauce and she brought out Tabasco (from the bar) even though many of their other dishes had other hot sauces in them.  They put so little pineapple salsa on the tacos you could barely notice it.  Ribs were moist and falling off the bone, and probably the best item we tried, but nothing special.  The poke tasted a little too fishy to me, and even though we ordered three different ""flavors"" there was so little difference in the tastes and we were all guessing which one was which.  Their wine list is next to nothing - 2 choices - 1 red, 1 white and both were expensive for what they were.  Our neighborhood needs some nice new flavors and I hope that Pa'ina steps up their game and improves their food (and wine list). It's a great location. ",2
" I had a reservation for 15 people for my birthday. We really liked the space and the food, but our server wasn't very good. He was really slow and seemed like he may have been new or just didn't know how to manage things very well. There was hardly anyone in the restaurant, and we waited so long to get our drinks that two of my friends just went to the bar and got their own. I checked online to make sure the restaurant took cards, and it said it did, but when we got there, they told us they couldn't take more than two cards for the whole table. It would have been helpful to know this ahead of time. They wanted us to tell them how to divide it up, but we didn't know what to tell them since everyone was by themselves. He asked me, which was even more awkward, since it was my birthday and my friends were paying for me. I used to be a server for a long time, and it is not difficult to pay a check with multiple cards, so I don't understand why it was necessary to make us uncomfortable about paying before we even ordered. I would go back because I enjoyed the restaurant, but the service needs some work. ",3
" Depending on what events are being hosted, this place can get lively- which is especially enjoyable when there's a sports game to watch on their number of TVs. Pair that with some drinks, spam musubi, poke, and kimchi fried rice and I have a full belly and a good time! ",5
" I was looking for a delicious spot to eat right before catching a movie. Lucky for me, I found this spot right underneath the theater I was going to watch my movie at. Immediately, when I walked right in, I was quite surprised by the great looking decor; modern and spacious.  The restaurant has 2  bars, which I didn't partake in, but I could see the vast selection from behind the counter. The hostess greeted me with a smile, so no complains there. I was seated right away, and my server gave me a run down of the food on the menu. Asian inspired tapas.   For food, this is what I had: 1) Pa'ina Wings - Huge wings, with a sweet Hawaiian sauce, soooo delicious!! 2) Shaking Beef Wraps - I do love my beef! 3) Kimchee Fried Rice - Gotta add the fried egg, but tasty dish and not overpowering with kimchee 4) Island Style Poke - Oh man, the quality of the tuna was superb! 5) Teri Sliders - Moist tender beef patty, bite-size, it sure satisfied my burger craving.  Overall, I really dig this spot. It's got a cool, jazz vibe, and it was perfectly situated below the theater. The staff was friendly and attentive. Great spot to grab some food before the movies. Have to bring the girlfriend next time. ",5
 I was looking for a date spot when I came across this place. the restaurant is huge with not one but TWO full bars. the friendly staff we chatted with told us that they did a lot of private parties so we booked my birthday party here and it was a hit! all my friends that came loved this place. not a lot of places in the city can accomodate parties larger than 20 people. will definitely be back! ,5
" I've frequented Pa'ina twice before. I believe in the third time is a charge. Service during those times were mismatched since we had two servers getting our orders wrong or the kitchen staff had goofed on not providing an ingredient that was stated on the menu. This time, we had an Island Mule and Lychee cocktails along with the Islander Poke, Wakame Poke, Chipotle-Sriracha Poke and Kahlua Pork Nachos.   If you enjoy spicy and mildly sweet poke, get the Chipotle-Sriracha Poke or if you have the salt palate, get the Wakame Poke.  Nachos were yummy and they give you a huge plate of it. We thought it was tapas style nachos until the plate came out. Well worth the price if you plan on watching football.   Conclusion? Satisfied. ",3
" After the new ownership change earlier this summer, I find myself coming here way more often, whether it was for their 25 cents happy hour wings every Wednesdays (I LOVE wings and I get 6 different flavors to choose from, at only 25 cents each!), to watching my fav Bay Area sports teams playing on their big screen,  to late night drinking at their bars, this place accommodates it all. I also threw my birthday party here and they were able to accommodate my party of 100+.   FOOD: Must try their spammies, wings, and tuna poki bowls! ",5
" What more can i say? The food is perfectly spiced as the dishes from region should taste. Tandoori chicken was grilled to perfection and Naans, mmm, too good and cooked to perfection. I am a foodie and i highly recommend this place. ",4
 Excellent quality food. We enjoyed both vegetarian and meat items.  Very fresh and authentic and strongly recommend to fruends ,5
" We were visiting SFO and looking for a place for Christmas dinner. We were in for  a treat, the service and the food was superb. We sampled the chicken tikkas, fish pakoras, spicy korma and rounded off with pistachio saffron kulfis. Some of the best Indian food we have had in ages. Highly recommended. ",5
 Service was attentive and helpful.  The wines keep pace with the spicy foods.  We liked seeing the kitchen through the big glass window.  The smoky eggplant dish was so good we ordered a second plate. ,4
" Flavorful food but horrible service and poorly timed delivery of dishes. Ambiance is ok, worsened by blaring music. Probably a better option for delivery or pickup as a result. ",3
" Staff didn't time food well. They could have warned us the ribs were going to take a while to cook. We finished our all our other dishes and the ribs weren't out, so we thought they forgot our order. ",2
" Great place to go for Hawaiian food.  If you are a foodie, you will appreciate the food here more like Hawaiian tapa-style .  I love their Hawaiian poke (raw ahi tuna) in 6 different ways.  The sides are great, too.  Try their kim chi fried rice.  Big place to hold parties, events, with a big stage and sports bar.  There is a bit of everything for everyone. ",5
" Really wanted to like this place, but service was so bad it made it really difficult to be okay with spending money here.  Completely ignored, had to get up and ask for a waitress to take order, had to ask where our drinks were to bus staff since we couldn't catch waitress (drink order was lost), food came, but not everything we ordered, had to ask twice for napkins, had to ask to have items not delivered taken off the bill. Waitress apologized when she brought bill, but that was only time we saw her after she took our order!!!   Again, the food was really yummy......I really, really wanted to like this place.......... ",2
 Very pathetic. Very very bad experience . Food was to bad and no body was serving the food . Came out few folks without eating ,1
" Good food, the bindi was the best I ever had. Waiter talked a lot but was friendly. I would return. ",4
 So glad we visited. Very hospitable and excellent food and service. The Aloo Gobi was the best I've ever had! ,5
" Terrible, I made a reservation through Open Table, it was confirmed and then when I got there they said they were not taking customers that night as they had a tour group in. I asked if we could do takeout and they said come back in 20 minutes, I gave them my number to call when ready, they never called, went back an hour later, was still not ready for another 10 minutes.  Got it home and it was terrible and not even the right order.  Very disappointing evening and it could have all been avoided if Open Table had not accepted my reservation for that night. ",1
" We arrived, party of 12.  Carpets were dirty. It was dinner time and the lunch buffet was half broken down and the area was dirty. We asked for ice water and were told they were out of ice. Bathrooms were dirty. We left. I wouldn't eat there. Bad service even worse ambience. ",1
" Chicken Curry is perfection. Fresh Naan. They don't have iced tea, but the hot Indian tea is a wonderful complement to your meal. ",4
" One of the most disappointing visits to a restaurant I can remember. They took our order, we waited nearly an hour to be fed, they forgot half our dishes and claimed that the orderer had left  without telling them the full range (this was 8pm), the chicken was like leather, they then didn't replace the things we had originally ordered and then came out asking to write down our credit number because their machine had broken. Just an awful comedically bad evening at a restaurant and I would strongly, strongly recommend that you don't go to it. ",2
" I was the only one in the place!   Food was good, but nothing memorable.  Had the full attention of the server. ",3
" The food was outstanding.  We had a bit of a communication issue with the server, but overall, it was a great experience.  I would definitely recommend! ",4
" It was okay, nothing to really rave about or complain about. ",3
 A very nice gastropub with great food.  They only serve beer and wine though.   The burger was really tasty... enjoy! ,5
" I chose this restaurant at random because it was close to my hotel and I wanted Indian food.  Since I didn't know the area this made sense. The walk to the restaurant was easy, but I passed many others which may have been a better choice.  Tandoori Mahal was quite when I got there.  Only one other table had diners.  Given that there was no one else there service could have been better.  The food was acceptable, but nothing to write home about.  I will not return. ",3
" I'm a frequent diner at the Indian Clay Oven restaurant on Clement St., SF, the original restaurant from the chain which Tandoori Mahal belongs to. Unfortunately the quality of food in these two places is totally different - while India Clay Oven is a food quality benchmark on my scale of Indian restaurants in SF, Tandoori Mahal is just an eatery, the food quality is average at best. Besides the food quality improvements the place needs remodeling or at least general cleanup. ",2
 The food was tasty and professionally served. Service was friendly and prompt. On the house desert was a nice touch! ,4
" Open on Christmas! That's why we went. Curries were excellent--rich, complex. Especially liked the salmon with spinach dish. Naan warm, buttery and satisfying. Portions were not especially generous; 1 dish=1 person. Service was so off it was comical. Maybe there was some key person missing due to the holiday. We had to order our drinks 3 times and they still got it wrong. On the other hand, when we ordered an extra naan, it came fairly quickly. I'd go back for korma and tikka masala though. ",3
 Decent buffet. The naan was good. They only had one chicken dish (with a cream sauce) and they used tandoori chicken as it's base. ,4
 The service at this restaurant is outstanding. The food is delicious. Located in a nice neighborhood. My friend and I always think more people need to know about this restaurant. ,5
" i was looking for a restaurant in the mission, that took reservations for a mid-week lunch, and i was thrilled to book this through Open Table. Paige, the waitperson, was amazing; she was warm, welcoming, flexible, professional, personable, knowledgeable, and accommodating. The food on the menu was comforting yet unique, and the chefs prepared every dish perfectly, attentive to our substitutions and preferences. The salmon was perfect, prepared rare and without the pork, and others loved the Grass-Fed Beef Burger (best burger ever), as well as the Roasted Lamb Sandwich. I ordered a butterscotch pot-de-creme to go, and my only regret is that I only ordered one, because it’s phenomenal.  We look forward to returning. thx for savory food and attentive service! ",5
" The waitress was very friendly, patient &amp; helpful. The fries were great &amp; the burger was good too but seemed a little small. ",4
 a large variety of options and open late. great after catching a movie at Alamo Drafthouse. good wine/beer/cocktail selection. ,5
 Fabulous everything! ,5
" Enjoyed happy hour, friendly service, no pressure to eat &amp; run. Spiced Eggs &amp; potted Chicken liver mousse were very nice. The Hangar Steak &amp; Potatoes were very good. Would recommend &amp; visit again. ",4
" Friendly and professional, just right ",4
 Had a pretty good evening here on my 2nd visit.    Ordered the burger and the brussels sprouts.  Service was friendly and reasonably quick.   The brussels spouts unfortunately did not get served but it was not added to the bill.    I would recommend coming here earlier in the evening and opentable is always a good bet. ,3
" Have been here twice and both times the food was good, warranting the 3 stars.  Have had what seems to be the go-tos (deviled eggs, chicken wings, liver mousse, pappardelle, and a few others).  All were good, but not spectacular or anything well beyond what one would expect in SF even in this relatively modest price range (think mid-tier happy hour).  Both times, however, the place was dead during peak hours when most the neighboring restaurants were bustling.  After twice experiencing terrible service, I now understand why this place is so dead despite the good food.  Service both times fell far below mediocrity and easily into the realm of lazy and rude, resulting in terribly slow service in a dead restaurant.  Anyone reading this review and doubting it in light of the other reviews (which I truly cannot comprehend in light of my experiences), should go on open table.  I'd bet there is tons of reservation availability.  Unless you are ordering Postmates or to-go, this is definitely a pass ... unless you are hosting a guest you really don't like. ",2
 Food was amazing! Server was on point as well. Definitely coming back here over and over again! ,5
" We have eaten here three times during the last two month. Each time was as good as the first time, which was excellent. This restaurant is worth a try, for sure.   Definitely,  one of the best values in the Mission and it is on our A list for all the restaurants in the Mission. ",5
 Great food and great service! Menu was comforting and yet a different spin on the usual. ,5
" Food was extremely overpriced for what it was. I ordered a salad that said it had a lot of ingredients on the menu, but it was basically soggy lettuce.   The servers kept double serving. One minute one person would take our drink order. A minute later a new person. This continued for the entire meal and was quite annoying. Get sections! ",2
 Shockingly expensive for bland fare that sounded great on paper.  We were to desperate to find a place open after 9pm to make a more discerning choice.  May have been adequate if not for the cost.  The place across the street had an hour and a half wait.  I guess that should have been a clue. ,3
 Great selection of sharing size plates. Flavors are wonderful ,5
" There's no crowd here for brunch, but there should be. Lots of comfort food on the menu, but it's prepared with restraint so the focus is on flavor first, comfort second. In other words, they don't abuse fat, sugar, and salt to seduce your tastebuds. Try the excellent grits with kale or the challah french toast that's full flavored without being overly sweet.  Great, attentive service at brunch. ",4
 Really delicious brunch - something for everyone! Service was great and would come back ,5
 Farm toast bread and creme fraiche ice cream were DELICIOUS ,5
 Great addition to SF restaurants.  Food was excellent; small menu but all dishes listed are enticing.  Has a combination of small and large plates which can be combined.  Lamb burger was outstanding; slices of cooked lamb with Moroccan tomato jam and feta on a brioche bun-fantastic! ,5
" Tried this after watching ""Check Please Bay Area"". Door person seemed a little stress, &amp; not especially welcoming nor attentive. Service started a bit slow although the restaurant was not full. Cocktails were ok, but not spectacular.  We started with deviled eggs &amp; they were tasty. Next was the Jersey Wedge &amp; that was very good. We liked that they lightly drizzled some dressing on the lettuce, but put more on the side for individual liking. Next was the potted chicken liver mousse. This was tasty, but not better than others we've tried elsewhere. Last small plate we tried was the spiced shrimp with creamy grits. This was very good with grits that actually tasted of corn. The entire dish was very flavoful.  We chose the papparadelle with pork cheeks which was very good. It  had a deep down mushroom flavor, but could have used a bit more salt. The burger on the other hand was very beefy &amp; had a great charred flavor. We think their burger is actually slightly better than Chez Maman &amp; Monsieur Benjamin.   While everything was pretty good so far, the deserts didn't do as well. The pot de crème was nice enough, but the butter scotch flavor should have been stronger. The thyme shortbread cookie was not good. It kept reminding me my dinner fell into my desert. The tres leches-almond brown butter cake had decent flavor but was very dry.   Overall, decent food &amp; their bus persons were very attentive &amp; hard working. Our waiter tried hard also but seemed a bit overwhelmed. We'd come back if in the neighborhood, but would not make a special trip. ",4
 Food was great enjoyed sharing to try all the different options ,4
 Ross our waiter was friendly. The chicken sammies were delicious and the dessert options were great. Enjoyed the pot de Crete and Zepponi. ,5
" Pass on the olives and chicken ""sammies"". Lamb sandwich was good. ",3
" My husband and I had a lovely meal here, before taking in a show at The Marsh, conveniently around the corner. (It's also close to the Mission-Bartlett parking garage.)  The wait staff were helpful and inobtrusive.  We were there early (6 pm), and the sun was setting on a warm day, making  it a little warm at our table. The server kindly positioned a fan at the bar to blow on us.  As the sun went down over the building across the street, things quickly cooled off.  The diversity of dishes (small plates, large plates, and starters) was a  real treat for our tastebuds.  I'd definitely go back for the lamb sandwich alone. For my husband, it was the grits and shrimp.  And oh, those Zeppole. Fresh. Light but dense. Wonderful dipping sauces.  We made a great choice. Yay! ",5
 it was a warm evening in the City and we had a wonderful meal. We would return. ,4
 Tried this for my birthday lunch with a friend and was very pleased. Modern atmosphere and clean lines. The wait staff was excellent and recommended best dishes and wines. Catered to our needs but without overkill. Loved the homemade potato chips with horseradish dipping sauce. Enjoyed the chicken sammies as well as the deviled eggs for starters. We raved about the lamb sandwich and the pulled pork sandwich with a bite! Really enjoyed lingering over a delicious lunch without feeling hurried! We'll definitely be back! ,4
" Very attentive server at lunch. Food was very good, especially the deviled egg and the pappardelle. In a neighborhood with lots of great options Myriad is a solid choice. ",4
 Great food and exceptional service. ,5
" My husband and I were pleased with our first visit, when we stopped in after a movie at The New Alamo. The restaurant had a steady stream of people coming in and out at 8pm on a Saturday, but it never felt too noisy or crowded. Very attentive, but not overbearing service from Danny and the rest of the service staff. Small plates were tasty, and our hangar steak was prepared a perfect medium rare. ",5
 Good gastropub food at a reasonable price. Friendly staff and reservations aren't difficult. ,4
 We called ahead to see if a basketball game was on the tv and they were so nice and accommodating. Very friendly place. Much fun. My kids loved the drinks they had. ,5
" Saw Myriad Gastropub featured on Check Please Bay Area and it got good reviews so wanted to give it a try. Did not disappoint.  Service was good, space was nice, not too loud. We started with deviled eggs which are very popular and lived up to the hype. My burger was cooked as ordered and tasted great. Went with 2 friends who are foodies and they raved about their dishes, one was a pork cheeks with pasta.       Was perfect place to spend with friends and will definitely go again.   I only wish they had a full liquor license but do serve beer and wine. ",5
" The service and ambiance wasn't much to write home about, but the food was outstanding and reasonably priced. Definately worth a try and I'd go back. ",4
 I ordered wine from the menu they didnt have it they suggested another white wine they brought it warm. I ordered food they brought the wrong meal. Service was slow even though no one was in the restaurant. This place has problems ,1
 The luncheon was a bit hit with my guests. Everythng was perfect. ,5
" My brother passed away recently and we gathered for a memorial service in San Francisco. We lived in India as children and Indian food was one of his favorite cuisines so I looked for for an Indian restaurant that could accomodate a crowd. (We were a group of about 40.) Not only could they handle the crowd, they helped me with the planning, advising me on the menu. The food and service were both excellent. My husband commented that he never thought he liked tandoori chicken until he ate the chicken at Tandoori Mahal. Other very good dishes included dal makhani, mattar paneer and rogan josh. The pakoras were heavenly. We were served family style and the staff paced the serving of the food just perfectly. An excellent meal all around! ",5
" The food was really good...some of the best indian I've had. We ordered mild and it was spicy, but not too spicy. The ambiance wasn't fantastic, but we wanted good food and definately got that. It was very reasonably priced. ",4
" The food was excellent, we didn't actually get what we thought we ordered, but we were quite happy with the food we were served. The restaurant itself is pleasant, quiet and causal. We enjoyed our dinner there. ",4
" Very good Indian food! Service was excellent, dined 6pm, not busy. Will go back ",4
" The place is small and therefore a little loud but I went with two friends and we were able to carry on a conversation okay. Good drinks menu - the beer selection is especially good, we also liked the cocktail recommendations. Food was great. We ordered the lamb sandwich, the pappardelle and salmon. All delicious although the brussels sprouts side dish seemed to be a little too crunchy, perhaps cook it a little before serving? Portions are large enough that you won't want a dessert. Our server was down to earth and knowledgeable. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a nice, casual place to eat and drink in the Mission. ",3
" Accessible flavors, warm welcoming service, overall tasty with some standouts. Great discovery. ",4
" A little rough neighborhood, but the food was out of this world. Drew was our server and he was fabulous.  We don't get the San Francisco often, but we're definitely going to come back. ",5
 Such a wonderful time. The food was tasty and the service was spectacular. Can't wait to go back. ,5
" We went early on a Sunday for brunch. It wasn't crowded yet, so it wasn't loud, which made me very happy. We loved the decor - comfortable but classy and fun. The food was delicious. Each dish had a little something special that made it shine without being weird or over the top. Service was warm and friendly and helpful. ",5
 From start to finish the experience of eating here was underwhelming at best   Major disappointment ,1
 Great food and friendly service! Went for casual brunch with friends and our waitress was very nice. Food was delicious (the shakshuka and pate were very popular with our group)! ,4
" We've been searching for quite some time for a go-to Indian place for our family in Marin, and we've found it. After living for ten years in London, our standards for great Indian food are high, and we had yet to find anything that really came close in Marin. We had a meal there last week with my two kids, and was really happy with the quality of the food. Only complaint we had was about some shrimp that simply weren't cooked enough. The rest of the dishes were great, the kids were happy, and so were we since we now have a go-to Indian place. ",4
 We were there during the lunch buffet so it got kind of crazy and loud. We decided to order from the menu instead and the team was still attentive and thorough. ,4
" I wish I could say this was a great experience - it was truly OKAY - no better !  Upon check in the concierge said that the Open Table system was not working - REALLY ?!? We were offered the buffet or option to order from the menu - I took the buffet and was underwhelmed - my friend had a vegetarian rice dish and appetizer - again, OKAY Doubt that I will return. By the way,  were there to celebrate my special #70 birthday - it was just OKAY :( ",2
" I have eaten here many times in fact I drive 20 miles from Petaluma but have only had lunch this is first time having dinner and I was super impressed.  We ordered tandori chicken, saffron basmati rice, raita  and lamb kebabs. The food was excellent. We also ordered a glass each of house sparkling wine, Zinfandel and Clausthauler.   Highly recommended. ",5
 Decided to try this as we like Indian food. It did not disappoint! Food was very good and will definitely go back and take some friends with us. The service was good and very friendly. ,4
" The food and service were great, but it was so very, very noisy.  It was hard to have a conversation at our table. ",4
" There are very few quiet moments when this foursome is together but we all went silent when tasting this incredible salmon. Salmon Kali Mirchi was worth the drive. It's herb encrusted, no sauce and simply stunning. The rest of the food was quite good and the people  were charming. We just kept ordering more orders of this dish which I can't ever remember happening before. We will definitely be back. ",4
" Ok, currently the ONLY Indian food in Novato, but it is still good. We were able to get a reservation on New Year's Eve. The service was informed and helpful. We have eaten here before, and will return. My only concern: many dishes have tomatoes, which I cannot eat. Would like to see more non tomato based dishes. When asked, I was told tomatoes could not be removed from servings. ",4
" I think Batika is the best Indian/Nepalese food in Marin County.  Fresh and clean ingredients and flavors, where some other Indian restaurants are a little ""same 'ol, same 'ol"", nothing really special or new and different.  We don't go anywhere else now.  I would say it's one of the few best all around restaurants in Marin, since we're generally lacking in good restaurants anyway in this county.  {: ",4
" When first I tried Batika a year ago, it was quite remarkable in that the flavors and ingredients had not been ""dumbed down"" in the mistaken belief that Americans are incapable of appreciating authentic Indian food.   Unfortunately, whether because a competing restaurant down the street failed, or because the kitchen staff has gotten bored with an unchanging menu, it has declined to the level of ""good generic"" Indian food.   I can only urge management to review this slide in quality. I am convinced that if ingredients were of higher quality, spicing (and I do not mean just heat) were sharpened and refined, and there were one or two regional or seasonal specialties offered, this could become a destination restaurant in Marin and beyond. ",3
" Truly a great indian restaurant. I was a bit concerned when I saw the cooks were not indian but they truly know what they are doing! Awesome food, I ordered the Tandori Chicken and asked for Tikka Masala sauce on the side, so yummy, we also got the palak paneer, usually at other restaurants it is so overwhelmed by onions that it isn't any good, not here, it was perfect! My only reason for not giving it 5 stars was because I was disappointed in the Nan and Roti, such small pieces of bread made it hard to wrap all the good food up together!  Enjoy! ",4
 Loved this sweet restaurant -- lovely service &amp; the food was excellent.   I'm picky about Indian food &amp; usually disappointed -- I highly recommend Batika! ,4
 Food and service is consistently good. The Indian ice cream desert is now my favorite soo yummy do not forget to try this one. ,4
" We have eaten here before and it is our favorite Indian food in the area.  The wait staff are friendly, polite, and eager to serve. ",4
" Staff were welcoming to three children in our party, and understanding when I called to inform them that we were going to be fifteen minutes late. ",5
 Staff are excellent The food is tasty What else do you want? ,5
" I love this restaurant! The service is friendly and attentive without being overwhelming, and the food is stunning. My friend and I totally cleaned our plates. I can't recommend it highly enough. Well worth seeking out. ",5
" We really enjoyed our dinner at Batika.  We order chicken curry, lamb vindaloo, coconut lemon shrimp with saffron rice and coconut rice, etc. Overall every dish was very tasty and cook well. But I must say the best out of the main three dishes was the coconut lemon shrimp it was made to perfection and the sauce was incredible. Every single person in our table was very pleased.  Great quantity, quality for your money. ",4
 One of the best Indian restaurants we have ever experienced. Would recommend this place to anyone. We dined outside. Whole experience was wonderful. ,5
" Consistently delicious, this is our go-to restaurant for wonderful Indian food. ",5
 Food and service was excellent . We been here a few times always consistent standard of excellence. ,5
 This was a graduation dinner for our daughter. The food was great and the waiter was very helpful in helping me select dishes that provided a nice variety of food and adequate portions for everyone in our party and the rest of the service was wonderful....  Thanks guys it was great! ,5
" We went for a family dinner outing, and the experience was very good overall. The only thing we split on was whether or not food was markedly better tasting than Lotus in San Rafael. I thought so, but the rest of the family didn't agree. ",4
" As always, we had another wonderful dinner. We always look forward to coming in. On Friday evening we sat next to a nice couple who was new to the area. They were so thrilled that they had found such a wonderful Indian restaurant. The food and service is always fantastic.  ",5
" Gosh, I love this place. Every single bite is so delicious. I should eat here once a week. I have been to India and truly love it. This saves that very long drive and flight. Take my word for it, this place is the best.   ",5
 We frequent Batika at least twice a month and we are NEVER disappointed! The food is always delicious and fresh and the service is friendly and prompt. The decor on the inside is ecclectic and fun but there is also an outdoor patio for 'al fresco' dining. Best Indian restaurant in Marin! ,5
 We love the fact we have a terrific indian restaurant in Novato that is as good as any in San Francisco. We visit there on a regular basis and always leave pleased with our choices and the quality of food. They offer a lunch buffet which is pretty decent as well for $8.95. Give it a shot. ,4
" My husband and I have brought friends with to dine at Batika Indian Bistro several times, as well as having eaten there on our own on several occasions. The variety of delectable and savory dishes available on Batika's menu are a delight to the palate. We have sampled a variety of lamb, chicken and sea food dishes as well as some of Batika's curries. We have never been disappointed with our choices. The food is absolutely delicious and the service is warm, friendly, very polite. The aromas emanating from Batika's kitchen as you enter the restaurant are heavenly. They are an olfactory indicator of the wonderful food that you will experience at this restaurant. We eagerly anticipate our next visit to Batika Indian Bistro ! ",5
" ..that was nicely marinated, moist and not overdone that one typically finds in most Indian restaurants! Achari eggplant was very good, spices were flavorful without being overwhelming. The Kashmiri Rogan Josh (lamb) would have been really good as well except the lamb cubes were not tender and seemed overcooked. The vegetable pulao was good; appreciated the vegetables not being overcooked. My preference is having the vegetables cut slightly smaller so overall dish texture be more balanced. The garlic naan was perfect! Great different pickled condiments along with their mango chutney were really good condiments that fit everything! Looking forward to sampling more on menu as they have very enticing options! ",4
" Four of us enjoyed great service and food. One of our party has a severe sesame allergy and the server was very attentive, making sure the hit hen was aware. I love the French brasserie-esque atmosphere. Everyone was delighted with their food choices, salmon, lamb and veggies. ",4
" HAD A GREAT TIME, FOOD WAS FRESH AND GREAT, BUT LOTS OF SMOKE THROUGHOUT RESTAURANT WHEN THE TOOMARI PLATES OF SIZZILING FOOD WOULD BE BROUGHT OUT TO TABLES, POOR VENTILATION. ",4
" We hate to admit it but we drove by this restaurant for years wanting to try it but hadn't. We began eating there about a month ago and love it. The food is fresh, delicious, and consistant. The staff has been very helpful as we have needed some direction while ordering. We will continue to go. It's now one of our local favorites. ",5
" We'd only experienced the lunch buffet which is decent food for a reasonable buffet price. When we scheduled a party for the evening, I was pleased to be able to do so online. Food was decent as usual, but the price was surprisingly high. I don't think I'll be scheduling dinner events here again. Still, nice staff and location. ",3
" Eating at Batika is like a trip on the Orient Express! Very authentic in terms of menu, food and waiters. Love this place so much, it's the best Indian food I've ever had! ",5
" Great meal, service, all-around pleasant experience!! ",5
" Wonderfully presented, adequate portions, affordable. ",5
" I ate here because it was conveniently located and the reviews were good. I was not prepared for how outstanding it was. This is the best Indian food I have had in the Bay Area. So often it is too heavy, to greasy or overpoweringly seasoned without subtlety. I found the food to be fresh, authentic and prepared with attention to detail. The waitstaff were attentive and gracious. Small but OK wine list. Kind of a romantic little restaurant with an outdoor seating area that would be nice for lunch. I look forward to going back. ",5
" I've passed by Batika countless times but never had the opportunity to go in. I am so glad I went the other night with two other companions. We shared many dishes and every single one was delicious! My only complaints are that the tables are a little close to each other, and the noise level is fairly high. I'd really like a slightly quieter dining experience, but it was otherwise top-notch. ",5
 Food and service were great. Second time visiting cant wait till we come again. ,4
 Love this place. Love the food. Love the owner. We practically licked our plates clean! Will be back many times! ,4
 Great evening with beautiful view of Bay Bridge.  Food was amazing and the service was just right! ,5
 Our reservations were great.  We had a round table as requested.  Food was delicious .  We ordered several different dishes and everyone enjoyed what they ordered.  We would go there for lunch again. ,4
" Great service, great meal, great view. You can't go wrong. ",5
 Great wait staff.  Cioppino excellent.  Our waiter found pillows to put behind my bad back. ,4
" The food was very good.  The service was outstanding.  The view was extraordinary, with a full moon rising over the Bay Bridge. ",5
 We were visiting San Francisco as a tourist and find this restaurant to try.  Paid around 270 USD including tips and taxes for 2 adult and 1 kid. Restaurant also take around 240 USD provision from credit card which is not released after 6days by now.     Valet parking is available with a cost around 12 USD.   Service is nice and  they are very  friendly.  Making reservation from open table was excellent. Restaurant reserved a table just in front of the windows. ,3
 👍 it was great ,5
" Service was attentive and friendly.  My partner ordered the tuna tartare and baked stuffed Bronzino and was very pleased.  My mussels were on the undercooked side and the sauce needed quite a bit of salt but was otherwise tasty.  My main, the daily special, was a disappointment.  It was described as baked salmon on a butternut squash purée and fresh asparagus, with a frisée salad.  It seemed like a child's portion when it arrived, with a tiny serving of salmon on 4 baby asparagus stalks, with a thin drying puddle of squash underneath and a few sprigs of frisée on top.  The salmon was mushy and didn't have a lot of taste.  We shared the Nutella pie, which was very good.  One particular annoyance was receiving a ""no-show""  email from open table the next morning, saying that I had failed to honor my reservation.  I had carefully checked in with the hostess when I arrived to make sure she found the reservation.  So overall a mixed experience but I would definitlely give them another try. ",4
 Pasta was not al dente-was overcooked and mushy.  Other courses were good. ,4
 We chose this restaurant for a view of the bay.  We arrived at 5:30.  We were seated upstairs with a beautiful view of the Lighted Bay Bridge.  Good idea to request upstairs when you make you reservation.  I had cedar blank cooked Salmon.  It had a nice glaze and thought it was delicious.  My wife had the filet of sole and was not overly impressed.  She thought it was dry and sauce was to bland. ,4
 Delicious crab; great food overall. Great location! ,5
" Went for my wife’s birthday and a close couple whose wife was also having her birthday. We were seated soon after arrival in the covered patio area with the most beautiful view of the bay. Appetizers of shrimps were delicious. The salmon special of the day was delicious, which 3 of us ordered; the other person ordered swordfish which he enjoyed immensely. It is a wonderful place for that special occasion! ",5
" Great happy hour and good entrees. Good space around tables, makes conversation easy. Good for dates. ",5
 Wonderful food and great drinks!!! ,5
" Hoping for a great meal and friendly host, waiter/waitress. It was my mother’s 75 birthday and her friend of 40 plus years plus 82 birthday.  So disappointed we were seated near a large group we had a difficult time carrying on a conversation because they were so loud. My mother and I ordered the special and it was barely warm, the bread on the sandwich was to much for the amount of meat you received. The bread was not a good choice lacked taste. Unfortunately when I mentioned this to the waiter he asked what kind of bread should it have been I told him I wasn’t sure. I really expected him to remove the cost from my tab which he didn’t. He came across a bit rushed. So disappointed I can’t go back and do my moms birthday over. ",3
" Beautiful view, wonderful &amp; friendly service, excellent cocktails (loved the Corpse Reviver #2 and the classic Margarita), good selection of rye whiskey &amp; solidly good wine list. Wednesday nights are 50% off selected bottles of wine (a good selection) and we enjoyed that. The truffle fries  were excellent - I won't usually order truffle fries because most truffle oil is fake and you can get a nasty aftertaste. My friends said they didn't care and I was shocked at how good they were. I also got an order of plain fries - wonderful. My friends burger was delicious, my other friend had the pot roast - also delicious. My husband and I both ordered the Creekstone NY steak with mushroom risotto. They steaks were properly cooked medium rare as we had ordered, but they were a bit tough and didn't have a lot of flavor. It didn't bother my husband as much as me, BUT, I write on agricultural and ranching and I have the advantage of buying beautiful grass-fed West Marin/West Sonoma county beef including Wagyu that sets the bar extremely high. The risotto was the only thing I would say was bad. It was a big glop of mush. But that's okay because I just ordered more fries! We were celebrating 2 birthdays and our server brought out a very nice little bag of sweet treats for both of the birthday guests.  I'm looking forward to trying their brunch. If you want a really quiet place to gather, it is very lively. Our server was wonderful helping us select a table not near other large tables and the four of us don't mind lively. ",3
 I have eaten at Hilltop many times and they have never disappointed me.   Their short rib pot roast is excellent and they do a great job on fish as well.   This time I had the special steak and risotto and it was excellent.   My colleagues ordered the lamb and fish and were all pleased.   Wednesday is half price bottle of wine night so we go there often on that day.   We always ask for Natalie and she is a really outstanding server.  I have known her for years and she does an excellent job.   I am sure we will be back. ,5
 We loved the view and the food was excellent!  Our service was perfect and very attentive.  We will enjoy coming back again soon. ,5
 The ambience was cozy and quiet for dinner with friends on a stormy night.  Baja prawn salad as group starter and baked salmon entree were excellent. Mixed drinks ver well done.  We recommend for celebrations! ,4
 Delicious thoughtfully prepared food. Traditional with a little bit extra. ,5
 This place was ill prepared for the New Year’s Eve. 1 hour and 40 minute for mediocre meatloaf and chicken plates. They tried to satisfy us for the wait by offering complementary dessert. Needs New management and waitstaff. ,2
" Over $230 for :  3 drinks (a tiny cocktail and two smalls glasses of wine) Mac and cheese appetizer (Good!) Hard bread Duck dish (mostly fat, hard carrots) Steak and small lobster (hard green beans and hard au graton potatoes) Good chocolate dessert  I get that it’s New Years but don’t really need to go back for that price... they also seat you on top of one another so hope you have a party of 4 or more. ",3
" We had reservations a few weeks in advance to celebrate our 15th anniversary. We arrived at the restaurant about 5 minutes early, and we were quickly seated in the back dining area near the bar. We sat and waited almost half an hour just to get a glass of water without any acknowledgement from any staff. The special menu that was given to us was not posted for New Year’s eve online, and the regular menu item my husband wanted was not on the menu - another disappointment. Also, the prices were higher than advertised online, which would’ve been OK if there was actually music and a band that we could see, hear, and enjoy.  I ordered the filet mignon, and it was superb. The waitress was very sweet, but the overall service was disappointing for the high price.  It’s was very loud as well. We were disappointed with the dining experience and probably will not ever go back. ",2
" Went for New Year's  Eve dinner and they sat us at a table that was so close to the next that it was hard not to bump it while getting to the bench seat. We ordered a salad and main entree. We got the salad and then the entree arrived. We sent it back. The waiter never came back to ask us if we needed anything, I had to flag them down. The noise was so loud I couldn't hear  the person across from me. Not a good experience considering the price! ",3
" Food and service were excellent, but tables were crowded into the bar area rather than the main dining room despite our reservation.  Very disappointing New Year’s Eve experience! Had we been told we’d be seated in the bar rather than the main dining room we would have choosen another restaurant for dining. ",3
" Lovely location, festive decor for holidays. ",4
 Thank you for another wonderful evening. Our server was outstanding and the food and drinks were excellent. ,5
" The food was ok; not a good variety, the atmosphere was nice ,  And the service was wonderful. ",3
" We usually like this place, but we’re a little disappointed this time. ",3
" This place has been here a long time and is a Novato staple, but I find it usually too loud at dinner to have a conversation and the prices are on the high side.  More enjoyable if you like a loud, bustling bar place. ",3
" The Hilltop has gone down hill and no longer will I consider Hilltop for a dinner location.   It has been years since I have been there, since I have been on the East Coast, and I will not return. ",2
" Great food, service was excellent. View was great. Great if you love seafood. ",5
 Very satisfied with the meal and ambiance. Upstairs was a little dark but fine. ,5
" Amazing evening... food, ambiance, service &amp; view! Perfect evening to see the Supermoon! Great way to wind down our trip in CA!! :-) ",5
" Rang in the New Year here, food was amazing and the view was spot on. ",5
 Cesar the manager was very attentive and seating us at our reservation time on s very business evening oh New Years Eve!  The view was breath taking!  Debra ,5
" My husband and I have dined at the “Waterfront” for 16yrs, and have always had a lovely time. However, this reservation was on New Year’s Eve, and not only did the food seem rushed, but immediately upon opening our second bottle of champagne, the waiter informed us that the manager needed us to vacate our table. They needed to seat another group; and when I asked “Where should we move to? Our champagne has just been poured!” The waiter just looked blankly and walked away. I was appalled; our receipt was well over $500, and the gaul to tell us to vacate with no help in moving not only the champagne, but our 3 children’s hot chocolates, was terrible. Needless to say, after 16yrs, we will no longer dine at the “Waterfront”; instead we will go to the “Water Bar”, where the service is truly impeccable. ",3
" Food was delicious, but the portions were very small for the price.  I spent close to $300 on lunch for 3 people. Only 1 person had 2 glasses of house Chardonnay ($16 for both glasses which is reasonable). The rest of the price was the cost of food. Also, they do not validate parking unlike several other great restaurants on the Wharf. ",5
 We enjoyed our dinner of the last night in San Francisco during our holidays. ,4
 Outstanding dinner with friends.  Have been here several times and never disappoints. ,5
" The service, all appetizers, desserts and 3 of the 4 entrees were excellent. One entree overcooked and a little too salty, but still good.  Great views.  It's one of our downtown favorites. ",4
" We were there on Christmas night, so prices were high and they served a limited menu.  Great view of Oakland Bay Bridge and service was outstanding.  Wine choices were excellent and food was good, but not worth $200 for two people. ",5
" Had a wonderful Christmas dinner at the Waterfront with my mom and my daughter. The food, service and ambience were excellent. We had crab salad, lobster tails, mashed potatoes and mushrooms, with chocolate decadence for dessert. The portions were generous and everything was delicious. Lovely classy place overlooking the bay. Highly recommend it for Christmas dinner or amytime. ",5
 Christmas dinner ,5
 Great service by a lovely waiter but the food really let the venue down.   We never questions set menu on Christmas Eve but the quality and price of this menu was very dissapointing. ,3
 The Waterfront was a frequent favorite of mine when I worked in San Francisco. I took a number of guests there over the years. But I had not returned in over five years. A friend was in town from England and merited a special dinner.   The Waterfront was perfect. Beautiful inside and even more so with Christmas decorations. A beautiful nighttime view of the bay and bridges. Super service and the food was top notch. This visit has reminded me why The Waterfront has been a favorite. I’ll be sure to return soon. They have successfully kept the standards high for a San Francisco classic. ,5
" One of the best locations, food and service in San Francisco ",5
" We ate on the patio, so I can’t speak for the mail restaurant area. The food was very good, but the best quality here is the view. As the name suggests, it’s right on the water, with picturesque views of the boats and the bridge. ",4
" As always, the Waterfront Restaurant and Cafe is a wonderful setting to enjoy visiting with family and friends. The food is great and the view of the bridge is lovely. ",5
" We had dinner on the Dec 16th,  made a reservation a mon ago &amp; requested a table by the window. When we arrived , I told the host we had reservation at 7pm. Then he pointed to a table where is not by the window, then I told him our request. He told me that everyone requested a table by the window, I was like Hello !! Just abt to open my month n say something. Then he said he will go check see is there any opening by the window, we waited like 10 mins, he Sat us by the window, so it was good, the reason we choose this restaurant , becuz of the beautiful view of the bay.  it was our  besties  get together X'mas dinner . Thought we will have a good time, but our waitress was not very attentive, her name is Brighid,  I order red wine, she gave me glass of white wine instead, then we ordered the small seafood platter, it was 85drs. There were 4 calms, 2 of them were like someone already ate , just left the edge of part of the calms . I told her abt it, she took them to kitchen &amp; took them same one back , &amp; said : the Chef said they were like that 😐  we were like Why another 2 are so full &amp; juicy , after we asked for some more bread, our waitress put the bread on top of thr empty seafood shell. Hello !! No clean plates ? Really? Where is her common sense. We have to told her to gave us some clean plate. After all, food was tasteless , I don't like salty food, but i have to put salt in every single dishes. I dont think we will go there again , Also, she was so rushing  to take our credit card after dropped off the check like less than 5 mins, after we signed , she rushed to took it back , even took our napkin on the table with her ,omg . When she rushed for our credit card , I asked her what time u guys close, she said 10:30. Ok, it was before 9pm. Not sure why she was so rush about ... it was not a good experience . ",2
 Service has dropped considerably. This was my go-to restaurant whenever I brought friends to San Francisco. Saturday was an off night in most ways. The best person was the person clearing our table and refilling our water...he was an 10+. Everyone else was a 5. ,3
" Great meal.  The Ceasar Salad had no anchovies in/on it.  We were not offered had to ask, and were not offered grated parmisano cheese over our pasta, we had to ask for it.  BUT, we were all good friend who just rolled with asking the waiters for help. ",4
 Good food but Chiopino could be better ,3
" Restaurant ok , view super beautiful,  waitresses are nice and friendly,  but the waiter so serious not friendly at all , food is not ok for the price , too high, .Thanks ",3
" Very disappointed in the restaurant.  The Sole was oily and terribly - my granddaughter the birthday girl couldn't eat it.  I trader her for my scallops which were tasty but only 4 for $36.00 or so.  Very overpriced.  We ate upstairs, good view poor ambiance - big, empty and unattractive.  I was unprepared for this to be so poor.  I would never recommend it.  Seems like a tourist trap. ",2
" The view is fabulous!  The service was excellent (half empty restaurant may have helped that).  The food was average and for the price paid it should have been excellent.  Two fish dishes (halibut and sea bass were both overcooked and dry).  Pay for the view, but don't expect a gourmet meal. ",3
 Had a great time! ,5
 We went for Thanksgiving and celebrating a birthday and was pretty disappointed.  First off they said I was a no show when instead they had me wait 15 mins on my reservation.  We then waited a half hour for our appetizer and another half hour for dinner and they ran out of all the desserts we wanted on a prefix menu.  I saw 2 other tables complain about the wait and mediocre food.  The only plus was the view of the bay bridge. ,3
 I was very disappointed. I didn’t know they were going to force a Thanksgiving set menu. The food was just ok. Nothing great to match the 70 $/pp charge. They ran out of  some food. Service was slow. ,2
" Horrible, horrible service...ordered 2 virgin drinks but they come filled with liquor (never deducted from bill), brings soups &amp; NO spoons, brings TG Turkey dinner &amp; NO knife to cut with, says will bring water, then gone x 10 mins &amp; we are choking, have to remind her x &amp; y &amp; z.  7:00pm reservation honored at 7:35 or 7:40pm.  Omg.  Food quality was good. ",3
" We hadn't been to Hilltop for awhile ( a couple of years), but decided to have our anniversary dinner there because we like to keep our money in Novato. The place is really nice and our request for a window seat was honored. Our waitress was new (first night), but handled our dinner experience very well. The manager also helped us select a wine which was very much appreciated. That part all went well although it got a little loud later, but that's really not under their control. It was crowded.  One thing that hasn't changed over the years is the food. It was just ok. We remembered that we had the same thoughts when we went years ago so we probably won't be back given the prices and the quality of the meal. Sorry, there's just too much competition around here to settle for just ok food. ",3
" Very disappointed in our experience here. Incredibly overpriced, insane amount of noise coming from the bar, and unapologetic management. Lunch is much nicer; will avoid dinner here in the future. ",1
" Food was good, but service was not good. Only saw our server when he took the order and then to give me the bill. Never asked how the food was or if we needed anything else. ",4
" Everything was good, except for the air conditioner blowing on us. Though three employees tried to turn it off, we had to switch tables to get away from the cold. All of us ate dinner in our winter coats. ",4
" The food is fantastic, service was attentive without being overbearing, and the restaurant had a charming, special occasion feel. Only drawback was how crowded/loud it was- there was a surprise birthday party as well as a large group from a daddy-daughter dance... but that goes to show how popular this place is! Our food was served in a timely manner despite the large groups that came in before us. ",5
 Server was brand new. Very good but asked for separate bills at the time we ordered and he brought one! He did correct the situation but not before a couple of us were tearing through our purses looking for correct amount. Hate that!! That’s why I mentioned it first thing! ,5
" Our reservation for two was for 7pm on a Friday evening. At 6:50 pm we called ahead to inform the Hostess we were stuck in traffic, likely 10-15 minutes late. We arrived at 7:10 and promptly seated. Then we waited....and waited some more. Our server (who was fantastic, attentive, warm and friendly) greeted us finally and then disappeared for a long time again. We realized they were working a section of tables all the way across the dinning room. When the server popped by again, we asked why they were assigned one table clear across the room. We informed we were seated in the ""pick-up"" section; tables assigned to no server on a Friday. Not the servers fault,  we squarely blame Management's procedure and the Hostess but our viewpoint was we had a reservation, communicated openly about our tardiness and should have been seated in a properly staffed section not the ""I lack a reservation section"". This was our first experience at Hilltop 1892 and had high expectations from recommendations.  We shared the muscles for appetizer, the broth was interesting and different. I had the Kobe Steak Frites, the steak was just okay, it wasn't the most tender cut. My dinning companion had the beef short ribs, they really enjoyed that dish. Our deserts were forgettable; i.e. they didn't leave any impression and I forgot what I had. Our tab was $132.00 w/corkage, we brought our own wine. ",2
" Waitress was great. Something happened in the kitchen and one meal was delayed significantly. They comped the meal without asking but it was disappointing.  The bread on the BLTs were burnt.  When we modified the reservation on Open Table, it changed the time. But when we showed up, the restaurant was empty.  Just not that great overall. ",3
" The calamari appetizer was fresh and delicious. We had risotto and fish and chips and everything was really well done and tasty. The desserts were also good bread pudding, snowball in hell and pumpkin cheesecake. Everyone was pleased and satisfied. ",4
 We had a lovely Thanksgiving meal with the family.  Our waitress was very accommodating to our needs  We'll go back again Thanks ,3
" We’ve been here before over the years as it changed owners, with mixed experiences. It seems to have really hit its stride. We went for Thanksgiving and I had requested a window table. We were greeted immediately in a very warm way and had the best table in the house- window in the back corner the service was outstanding, no snobbery, attentive, the lighting was perfect, and the Thanksgiving menu did not disappoint. I had the traditional turkey feast and it was a TON of food!  My husband had the steak and was very pleased. The dessert was obviously pre-packaged and a little underwhelming, but it gets a pass as it was a holiday menu. This is the best location in Novato- a city seriously lacking in culture. Hilltop adds a great getaway which feels like being transported away. ",5
" Outstanding Thanksgiving meal -- great ambiance, good food, excellent service and very homey family atmosphere.  Took two family guests who lost their home in Santa Rosa in the recent fires.  It provided a warm and friendly environment that took away their cares for a few hours.  Hilltop was just the medicine they needed.  Thank you HILLTOP staff! ",5
" I've dined at Hilltop 1892 on several occasions and have always had a pleasant experience.  It's a beautiful restaurant with great food, wine, and service.  It's a wonderful place to go to with friends or on a date.  The calamari appetizer is a must. ",4
 My boyfriend and I celebrated our anniversary with Hilltop 1892 and had an amazing time! Our server was lovely and even put together a little anniversary 'gift' for us! ,5
 HIlltop is a good place to meet friends for a nice lunch. Service is good.  My salad was good but with a bit too much dressing. ,3
 We came here for my husband's birthday. We brought a cake for the celebration. There were 5 guests in attendance.  The cake we brought was a small chocolate moose.  Somehow the cake got mixed up with another's group cake. Their cake was a large sheet cake that would feed 20 people. Lucky we noticed it before it was cut.  We were charged $3.00 per person to cut our cake. We felt that the fee should have been waived due to this big embarrassment. Especially since they sung Happy birthday to Kathy instead of Ron. ,3
 I celebrated my birthday with my family and it’s the 1st time in quite a while I have eaten here. It was very loud when we first sat down at 7:00 pm (Saturday evening) and a bit hard to hold a conversation. It got better during our evening. Dinner was very good with the exception of the fried calamari we had as an appetizer. My vegetarian meal was excellent. ,5
" Great ambiance. Slow service. Waited 45 minutes for entrees. After plates cleared, waited 30 minutes for dessert menus. ",3
" Hostess should learn not to fling her hair.  Service was fairly attentive, not spectacularly so.   Most of the food was good (eggs benedict, clam chowder, fries); however, I didn't like their rendition of ""Toad in a Hole"" and  definitely didn't  like the red pepper sauce on top of  it. ",3
" As usual, it was another wonderful dinner at The Hilltop!  There were a couple of large group parties on this particular night, so it was a bit noisier than usual.  Other servers pitched in to make sure we were not ignored!  Nice teamwork! ",4
 The food was excellent and the service superb.  there is a nice selection of options. ,5
" Great food...just the right amount fir small plates. Tasty, friendly, accomodating staff, nice wine list, easy to get to. ",5
" Nice, quiet atmosphere, even for a Friday.  Was able to converse.  Lots of menu choices and I like the smaller appetite/price options.  Everything we had was delicious and great service!  Very enjoyable dinner. ",5
" Always like Rickey’s.  Our waiter said you are in the process of updating the menu, which is much needed.  Looking forward to the changes.  Hopefully no CA foo foo or small plates!  Meat, fish, and good pasta is what we crave.   As a footnote,  I had one of the worst top shelf Old Fashions the night we were there.  Hopefully that will change! ",4
" We had a great time at Rickey's. Their mid-week dinner specials offer a wide variety of meals, including salad, dessert and a glass of wine. Wonderful food at an incredible price! ",5
 Fun local place. Solid Burger and they do offer smaller plates if you aren't super hungry. Definitely will go back. ,4
 We enjoy special occasions and getting together with friends at Rickey's. ,4
" We had a great time at Rickey's, as always.  Our waitress Leslie was very friendly and made a point of explain some of the perks available from our Rickey's card.  One busser seemed in a bad mood and was somewhat abrupt.  Otherwise, it was a great experience. ",4
" Excellent menu, many choices including small plates. Outstanding ambiance and service. ",5
 The live music was a nice touch but a bit loud. ,5
 This was the one weekend we had to get home early and then go out to dinner and have a wonderful meal with the marvelous help of Nelson and this amazing staff.  It was everything we hoped and expected.  Thank you to this great crew. ,5
" The music was so awesome for New Years Eve celebration, and the service excellent. Leslie took good care of us!! ",4
 It was New Year’s Eve so I’m guessing they just couldn’t handle the restaurant being busy??  It wasn’t even completely full. No crowd at the bar. We sat down just before 7pm and didn’t see our server until 7:18. We got our drinks a few minutes before dinner was served. Just overall disappointing on New Year’s Eve. ,3
 We went on a Saturday thinking that Sunday would be jammed.  We ate at a relaxing pace and enjoyed every morsel.  The service was superior. ,5
" This was 0ur second time here and the experiences were like night and day.  The first time things were perfect,this time it was almost unbearably noisy. The shrimp in the ciopino was seriously overcooked although the rest of it was delicious. The salad was under dressed and dry. And the poached pear although pretty on the plate was served a spoon which made it hard to eat. I had to ask for proper utensils to eat it also had to ask for coffee service as the waiter didn't offer . I recommend Rickeys for daily dinner but not for holidays .also the table arrangement made it hard for people with walkers  and such to negotiate the room, also the holiday menu had no provisions for food allergies, my wife would have loved to have tried the  Galette. But, she is allergic to shiitake mushrooms. ",3
 Since it was Christmas Eve and maybe not the best time to try someplace we haven’t been we may try again.  But entrees were all over cooked and the rest of the meal was not anything special. ,3
" Dined at Rickey's for Christmas Eve. Even though I had made reservations a month in advance, we were going to be seated in the lobby of the restaurant next to the door. After I suggested that they find a better table inside the actual dining room, we were seated.  Server was friendly but not real attentive, which was most likely because of being under-staffed. I had to go to the bar myself to hunt down decent wine glasses. The entrees were fine (we all had beef), but a bit overpriced. And the menu for this night was somewhat limited. Not a place I would go back for a special occasion, but might go back and sit at the bar with appetizers. ",3
" Slow slow service, but it was Christmas Eve. Sometimes 20 minutes between courses. Hard with kids. ",2
" We enjoyed the festive holiday ambience and talented female vocalist entertaining with holiday tunes.  Our server was warm, friendly, and accommodating.  On the downside, a hamburger ordered medium had to be sent back after we discovered it was cooked extremely rare.  My cocktail was out of balance and needed fixing.  Our entrees were nothing special.  Was the chef out of the kitchen?  We're not sure. ",3
" The evening dinner was a Wonderful time to spend with my grand-daughter and her husband. It was a celebration of a new job for my grand-daughter. Her husband and I just love your lamb dishes and she loves your fish choices. Wine was great as well as the five choice dessert plate. Thank you again for a delightful evening, we will be back. ",5
" We know that Ricky's has recently changed hands, but we were a little disappointed. We had asked to be moved from in front of the music and we were seated by the door (which was fine) but then we had to go and ask for a waiter.  I had the small filet which was good but potatoes were very lumpy.   We had a coupon for an appetizer and when we told our waiter, he just said he'd take it off our cards and walked away.  That would have been fine if we were paying with cards, but we had cash.  So we just deducted it from what we paid.  Neither of us were impressed with the service. We will be back at some point, but feel the new group needs to get it together a little bit more before we return.  Good luck ",2
 We were a party of 10 and our waiter Abraham was on top of things. Food was good and everyone was very friendly. ,5
 We came early on what would be a busy night and we’re seated quickly.  The banter was light and the service was excellent.  Our meal was delicious and perfectly presented. ,5
" 3 had the prix fixe special menue and all were very happy.  Unfortunately I had the Cobb salad with Dungeness crab.  The crab smelled and tasted fishy, a bit old.  And the waiter told me there was no salad dressing for shrimp louie (guess I should have asked for thousand island)  Also, the water is not filtered and tastes awful if you're used to filtered water.  Overall good, but for me, terribly disappointing this time. ",3
 Have Nelson serve us and the staff buzzing about made us feel very much at ease.  It was a very good visit with a wonderful meal. ,5
" We have found our new Thanksgiving tradition.  The food was delicious, the service was awesome and the price was beyond reasonable.  I can't say enough about our experience. ",5
 I've always loved Ricky's.  John started with a broken down hotel and created a great place to stay and a great local restaurant.  John-best of luck to you in your retirement! ,5
" As always, we had a great time with our friends.  We meet at Rickey's every so often as it is in the middle between Rohnert Park and Mill Valley.  We have always been very pleased with the menu and our waitress this time was more than good; she was excellent, as were all four of our meals.  We two women had the snapper Vera Cruz on the small plates - yummy and plenty to eat.  The two men had the flat iron steaks with the clam chowder and a crème brulee for dessert.  We will be back for sure! ",4
" Great service, friendly, atmosphere, music, great food. Open areas for seating, ",5
 We came early and we were seated in a great booth.  We had a great Cabernet as the dining room filled.  The pace was perfect ant the foods was sumptuous and beautifully presented.  Such a rewarding experience. ,5
 Was seated at the front door and service took over 20 min which we had to prompt for our drink and appetizer orders. There was live music going on but couldn’t see whatsoever with curtains.  Most likely will not return ,2
" Rickey’s is a great place for a get together for friends.  One of our part of six had a birthday and we used the occasion to celebrate with friends.  The music, service food and location are great.  We are regular visitors. ",5
" Went in early, seated right away, totally ignored by waitstaff though not busy, so we left after 10 minutes. ",1
 Food was good but service was spotty. Our appetizers arrived the same time as our entrees.  Had to ask for refills on soft drinks. ,4
 Service was very slow. Food was not that good. Artichoke and spinach dip was horrible. More than likely will not go back. Our waitress was very nice we just felt service was very slow. Food mediocre. Maybe a new chef and if it’s not the chef maybe some new recipes ,2
 The food was excellent.  Service was great.  Would definitely go back to this restaurant.  It was a very pleasant experience.  Their blood orange martini was amazing. ,5
 We Just moved to Novato and this was our first date night here and it was a great choice. Very pleased. Filet could have been cooked longer. It was RARE!! Ordered medium cooked and should of sent it back but I really didn’t want to bother anyone or ruin the mood setting!! I would definitely return 👍🏼 ,5
" At always, the experience was wonderful. Good food, good prices, excellent service. We will definitely return! ",5
 I always enjoy Rickey’s. Price fix menu is my favorite and makes a dinner out reasonable. ,5
" We had planned a dinner in Sonoma with friends, but the decent Firestorm changed our plans.  This was a wonderful, welcoming best recovery option and we loved it! ",5
 I had dinner at Rickey's to celebrate a birthday for a friend because wanted to listen to the live jazz. Live jazz was very good and the singer came to our table which was delightful. Pomegranate martinis were not that good as the martinis were somewhat watered down and at $10 a cocktail they should be better.  Service was very slow and although we had stated to the waiter that we would like to have a glass of wine with dinner he never asked before the meal if we would like to order wine. The salmon and rack of lamb was excellent. ,3
 We had 3 other people with us and they have never been before. They will definitely come back. They all loved their food. ,5
" The last two visits at Black Angus in Vallejo I had to request different seating both times, hosting needs to pay more attention to customers who do not want to be seated in a teeny tiny booth nor anywhere near a table of 14 okay!!  Love the food, service was great last visit and they actually gave us hot baked potatoes this time!!!  Last time before that server was inept and therefore our dinner was not as enjoyable as it could have been, aside from the fact that we were moved to a larger booth but closer to kitchen in the bar dining room so quite a lot of distraction buy hey I already moved once so dealt with it!!!   I do think that if you are a customer paying damn good money for a nice steak dinner in nice restaurant, don't go cheap on the service or seating in funky areas of the dining hall!!!!  Especially when it is not very busy!!!  It's our family's go to birthday restaurant so I'll be back for the prime rib and rib eyes and lobster of course!!  The jumbo shrimp on the menu are not JUMBO SHRIMP, they are regular shrimp but they are good!!  Nuff said.... ",3
" Disappointing !  We chose local to eat for my husband's BD-    We ordered a bottle of wine and our meals.  Nothing complicated and within guidelines of menu choices.   We waited quite awhile and our wait person returned and indicated that the kitchen was OUT of Brussels sprouts.  That was no problem.  After nearly 40 minutes, someone showed up with our hot entrees. But - we were NEVER served our salad choices.  No one offered to take back our entrees as we enjoyed our salads -instead, -our table was littered with all these food plates- all at once. A manager stopped by, and saw the disastrous meal- and mumbled something about a free dessert!  ( No thanks!)  Our steaks were both over cooked and cold by the time we got around to eating them. The same man stopped by again- my husband showed him a piece of overcooked steak.   The bill came and we were charged for only 1 entree, but got charged for the non-existent Brussel Sprouts.   We were OVER this place.  Usually, Black Angus is consistent, reliable, and offers a valued product.  NOT this time.  Waitstaff and kitchen were unacceptable. ",1
" Great location to the theater, wonderful strive and decent food! ",5
" Everything was good for the most part. We were a party of 7 (1 child), but my 7 year old son's food didn't come with everyone else's. We had to ask a second time for his meal and my sister's salad. The server did not charge us for for it. Food took a bit to get to the table and they ran out of brussel sprouts. Overall it was still good. The server was attentive and nice. ",3
" Prime Rib was awesome, service was excellent!  Would definitely recommend! ",5
 The food was great. The service was even better.  The Rib Eye was hot and juicy with lots of flavor. The bread was hot from the oven. The server was great.  She had several tables but we still got great service. ,5
" I made reservations and we were seated immediately. It took our server approximately 20 minutes to take our order. We had to ask our server  continuously for drink refills. Our salads and soups took approximately 30 minutes to be brought to us. Our entrees took another 30 minutes to come out. The restaurant was empty of patrons. Our bill was $113 dollars for four of us with a $20 off coupon. The food was delicious but the service was way less than desirable. Two hours in all for dinner, extremely slow. Very expensive compared to other steakhouses such as Texas Roadhouse. ",3
 Best service i had in days.... the food qere cooked the way we wanted. My family and I are really please with Black Angus vallejo. ,5
 Our waitress was so impatient in taking our orders. She even had a tantrums by taking one of our orders by getting it by her hand and left. This makes our evening so awkward and unpleasant.  She didn’t even apologize. I talked to her  manager about the incident and the manager was so nice and accommodating and make it right with one of our order.  I think you should train well your employees on how to handle this kind of situation. Even though she treated us poorly we still gave a good tip. She doesn’t deserved the tip but it’s not for her it’s for the whole employees who helped us.  Foods were ok not really something to come back. ,3
 I’m not sure how this place is still in business ,1
" I had the Rib eye steak that was cook to perfection,  mash potato  and salad.   I was thier on NEW YEAR'S  EVE. The service was great. ",5
 New Years Eve ,5
 The service was good but I noticed the restaurant is not being kept up from when I first visited . The booths seats are filthy need to be changed or deep cleaned. The dinner was good for the value but the steak was tasteless &amp; tuff. 🤷🏽‍♀️ ,3
 We go to Black Angus often. Never disappointed. The service was extremely fast and server was great! ,5
" The food was great. Service attentive,  just right. Good table.  6 oz. Filet with two lobster tails and two sides, baked potato and green beans with bacon pieces. ",4
 Excellent as always🥂 never dissapointed. Food is always as ordered. Kids meals are really good also. ,5
 Our Server was friendly and well meaning but did not bring the steak sauce and over charged us for one of the orders. ,2
 Great time. Great food. Good for a birthday lunch/dinner. Using Open Table was easy. It was my first time using it.  Thanks ,5
" My wife, daughter, two lady friends and I (lucky me) have a great dining experience celebrating my wife's birthday and one of the lady friend's birthday who also became a U.S. citizen the day before. So it was a big and enjoyable get-together for all of us. Three of use enjoyed steaks, one had lobster and another had the vegetarian salad (and that's no beef). Thank you Black Angus Steakhouse for a memorable  time with very friendly service. ",5
 The food choices were great and we used a discount coupon. I especially like the use of Open Table. The app is easy to use and amnend your arrival time if necessary. The restaurant was ready for us when we arrived. I highly recommend using Open Table. Linda Z in Vallejo Ca ,5
 My husband and I went there for a date night dinner. The service was excellent. The waitress was the perfect amount of attentive. The food was served hot and it was delicious. ,5
" Steak was good, was disappointed with the Sour cream and butter on Bake potato...that brand is not capable with red lobster...too creamy and like water down other than that very happy how my steak was done and I like the amount of caesar salad ",4
" We had reservations, yet the receptionist at check-in was awful! He walked us around and around, then sat us in an area that was so busy that the waitress did not say a word to us. Then we moved to another table, yet we were told that we would not get served there since there was only 1 server! That made us get up and leave.....bad service that day! ",1
" Food was good, as always. Best cheesy bread &amp; potato soup. Service was just ok. We were seated right away at our reservation time.  Chocolate chip cookie dessert was delicious! ",3
 Great food. Incredible service. We will return again for our next special occasion. ,5
 We always enjoy coming to Black Angus. Thanksgiving was every bit as good as everyday dining. ,5
" We was seated in a nice area waitress was nice, while sitting there a family next to us brought in there dog and had it in the booth alot of people was upset including my family but once our waitress saw our face expression and other guests the family was ask to leave and they did with no problem I feel they was never should have been seated at all the dog was not hidden and was being carried wasnt even a service dog...But other than that Food and drinks was good ",4
" It was my first time visiting the Vallejo location, and on thanksgiving of all days, and I wasnt disappointed to say the least. Service was quick and efficient and our waitress was on top of everything, even though my bro the was giving her a tiny bit of a hard time. Would definitely reccomend. ",5
" My husband had the Thanksgiving meal which was delicious and hearty with thick slices of turkey, gavey, mashed potatoes, yams, cranberry sauce, brocolli, salad, bread, and pumpkin pie. I had the prime rib which was cooked perfectly medium rare, tender, and well seasoned, baked potato, soup, bread, and chocolate cake. We also ordered a side of 2 lobster tails. Surprised that the entire meal came to only 83.00. Will return again and again. ",5
" I must say, for having Thanksgiving at a restaurant, this meal wasn't bad at all.  We  were given approx. a teaspoon of cranberry sauce,  for which I was bummed.  The turkey was very tender, the potatoes were good, the dressing was really good and the pumpkin pie was very flavorful. Other than minimal amount of cranberry sauce, I would have to say that our waiter (very nice young man) was extremely loud! I didn't feel like we were at a mid level restaurant, I felt like I was at a Denny's or IHop. ",3
" We came here for Thanksgiving lunch and had a great time! Turkey with all the fixings, good service - thank you, Kim! - and food was tasty. ",4
 Pretty good option for a traditional Thanksgiving meal.  Definitely fills you up and all items tasty. ,4
" Great service. A little noisy, hard to have a quiet conversation. ",3
" First of all, the Campfire Feast Deal is very good, and I was able to choose some exciting choices for the combination of the deal.  I ended up sharing the Campfire Feast for Two deal with my wife, and we both had Caesar salad, salmon, and mashed potatoes. The choices were very appetizing, seeing how mashed potatoes are a very classic side to any steakhouse dish.   The service my wife and I had was very good, and our server was kind and humorous. I applaud him on his ability to keep his customers satisfied.   Although my meal and the server were pleasing, I was also dining with other family members to celebrate a birthday, and one of their meals did not arrive until we were finished eating.  Overall, the ambience, food choices, and service all make an 8 out of 10 rating. ",4
 We dined for my son's and his girlfriend's birthday Saturday the 4th of November 2017.My wife's Prime Rib was way to thin compared to the last time we went and we also had to send it back because it was raw. It came back well done not a good dinner for my wife. Also I mentioned in the Open Table comments that is was a Birthday Dinner and was not acknowledged from  the restaurant staff. ,3
" My husband and I each enjoyed the Trio Special (steak, lobster, and fried shrimp with 2 Classic Sides). Plus, I took home a large slice of chocolate cake. Yum! ",5
 1st time there and loved it! Steak was a little under cooked but I could've asked to correct it but I didn't. Service was great! Coupon for 2 for $44 was an excellent deal! Will be back soon! ,4
" Our server was Ricky and she was absolutely great!  Friendly and welcoming!  Food was consistent from previous visits. Good food, good value ",4
" The beef stroganoff and pork belly specials were each ,  excellent.   The service was very slow, but we were offered bread and were not in a hurry ourselves, so that was not a problem on this occasion. ",4
" Always enjoy coming here. Food is wonderful: American bistro style. Service is great, not intrusive. Staff is fun. ",5
 Only thing that was good was the rotisserie chicken. The brisket was way too salty and dry. The first bite was good and then it was very disappointing. The cauliflower and sprouts were too greasy and heavy. ,3
 The food was excellent. The duck was so good and the grilled romaine was an excellent starter! ,5
 All 4 meals were EXCELLENT! They do meat to perfection! ,5
" It haves the impression of not quite having all the kinks worked out, got there had to wait 15 min for menu to be printed, food was delicious but extremely long amount of time between courses, and sigh the served their 10 yr old tawny port chilled ",5
" Hoffman's is a great neighborhood restaurant in a neighborhood that's gotten quite competitive. Their rotisserie chicken and specials (lamb, pork, duck etc...) are consistently excellent and their burger with the pretzel bun and aged cheddar is the best I've had in San Francisco.  They've got excellent wines at decent prices and service is always fast and friendly. You'll leave here with a happy mouth and a full belly :) ",5
" Hoffman's never disappoints.  We ordered the grilled caesar salad and we loved it.  Then we got the roasted cauliflower, brussell sprouts with blue cheese, the spaetzel as sides, and the whole roasted chicken and a duck entree to share between 4 of us...way too much food.  It was a feast with tons of leftovers. ",4
" A pleasant, family friendly place with good food at a great price point.   Loved it. ",4
" Hoffman's in three words: Delicious. Un-fussy. Satisfying.  We started with the grilled romaine salad, which was smoky and crunchy and interesting. Next came pan-fried panisse (think batons of polenta, with a slightly crispy exterior) with a flavorful Romesco sauce.  It was a cool night, and we were hungry, so we ordered the whole rotisserie chicken to share. It was ENORMOUS, and came with potatoes &amp; tiny white onions in a silky, chicken-y pan sauce. We took half of it home with us.  In a city filled with amazing food options, it can be hard to find a restaurant that does comfort food so well - no twists, no gimmicks. Just high-quality basics done right. Fantastic. ",5
" Best, most tasty, restaurant I've eaten at in some time.  All 3 of us at the table were raving about the food as we ate it. Top drawer. Since we picked it because we could get a last minute reservation (and the vegetable appetizers looked good) we were pleasantly surprised at how good the food turned out to be. ",5
" I returned to Hoffman’s a year after my first visit and I’m thrilled to be able to say my meal was (again) absolutely perfect.  I LOVE this place.  If parking were easier, I’d be there at least once a week. ",5
" The best clam chowder ever. It's different than your typical cream-based clam chowder with less cream, clams in shells, and chunky potatoes and veggies. ",5
" I had the burger with bacon and gruyere, but without the bread.  The dish came with a side of fries, and a special pickled pickle.  It was good.  Our table ordered a side order of fries, but it was a bit spicy than the ones that came with our dish.  I also tasted the tuna, which melted in my mouth &amp; cooked to perfection.  The pear apple crisp was also great.  A nice neighborhood spot! ",4
" Service was slack and inefficient. Our waiter was confused about our order and got it wrong but did not ask the right questions to clear up his confusion. We had to request bread, a missing entree, and get his attention for the check. Food was good, ambiance pleasant, casual to a fault, especially for a special occasion. ",3
" Beef stroganoff was awesome.  This is a small, friendly, neighborhood place with great food and inviting atmosphere. ",5
 It's so good I'd like to  lie to keep it all to myself! ,5
" Hoffman Grill is one of those great neighborhood ""Go-To"" places if you can't decide what and where to eat for the evening. Great variety on the menu despite a relatively small menu. The food is definitely focused on the comfort food side. Homemade pasta and homemade bread. How can you go wrong. We will definitely go back even though we don't live in the neighborhood. ",5
 This place never fails to make a great meal. ,5
 Beef stroganoff perfect. Dishes are a cut above usual Valencia corridor fare. Hearty and satisfying. ,5
 We had the asparagus and brussel sprouts for appetizers and shared the short ribs for dessert. Everything was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing. The short ribs were tender and seasoned well. Definitely will be returning. ,5
" We went there for my birthday.  The food was wonderful.  Run, don't walk. ",5
" We had a reservation for Sunday at 10:15am to celebrate my best friend's engagement. We sat outside in the glorious sunshine and really enjoyed the grapefruit mimosas and cazuela dish. Food was great, French Press coffee was amazing, and the servers were very friendly. Would definitely recommend! ",5
" Best food, staff and restaurant I've experienced in a long time. Can't wait to come back ",5
 Food was excellent.  Chowder is pulling us back.  Pleasant and competent staff. ,4
" We enjoyed our server, Kodiak, tremendously.  He was attentive, charming and helpful.    We weren't too hungry so my husband and I split an appetizer of grilled fava beans with meyer lemon &amp; fennel.  We weren't sure how to tackle this.  They were still in the shell so we didn't know if we were supposed to pop out the beans (like when you eat edamame) or if you were supposed to eat the shells (since they were tender and smokey from being  grilled).  The shells actually had a lot of flavor so we did eat those, leaving the stringy seams behind.    We also split the side cauliflower (which was good, but, well...it's cauliflower which is generally just a flavor catcher) and a pork entree, (similar to brisket) that had a delicious sauce and roasted small potatoes.  The pork was really tender. ",4
 Great spot. The wine list is nice and farelt priced. Dessert menu could be improved ,5
" Tasty standards like the house made pretzel bun burger, lots of house made touches and specials. On this visit lobster halibut cakes! ",5
" I was visiting San Francisco for the weekend and met my son for brunch.  We were seated promptly after making a reservation on Open Table.  The menu was interesting and after recommendations from our server, I tried the cazuela and my son had the chilaquiles.  Both were delicious!  The inside dining area is small but there are tables outside.  The host and  servers were all very nice and efficient.  However, because the restaurant was so busy, it took over 1/2 hour to get our food which was fine since were not in a rush. ",4
" We had a timely seating for our reservation. The host/manager was a little on the curt side. Our server seemed a little passive/new/slow in taking our order, and to no surprise, our food took a long time to get to us. When we did get our food, it was wonderful. We just wish we had had some coffee left in our mugs at the time. ",4
 Precious cozy little spot with delicious food!  Very accommodating to dietary restrictions. ,5
" I hate the idea of folks giving ratings based on service, but this was a miserable experience, so I am making an exception to do so. The other week, I made a reservation for brunch and selected indoor seating, because OpenTable gives you the option. I then waited more than forty minutes for my table this morning. At the 35 minute mark, when I asked about the table, the owner snapped at me that he has a sixty person restaurant and everyone wants to sit inside. If you take reservations and give the option of selecting inside vs. outside, at least honor those who took the time to indicate where they wanted to be seated. The food is good here but not worth the attitude. They then usher you through your meal so that they can turn the table quickly. I ended up waiting longer for my reservation than I was seated ""enjoying"" my meal. ",1
" We had a wonderful experience at Olea. The owner is incredibly friendly and was very accommodating to my family and I. I am in a wheelchair and accessibility into the restaurant isnt all that great but they already had alternative options ready to go for me upon our arrival . You could really tell that they cared and put actual effort into making sure my family and I had a stress-free, pleasant brunch. Thanks again! ",5
" Staff was very polite and organized.   We were seated quickly, food came out quickly, staff was never rude or in a hurry for us to move.  Food was very good. ",5
" There are two lines for tables. One for people who made reservations, one for people walk-ins. They are busy so they keep checking on you every 10mins, you feel pressured to eat, finish and leave asap.  Mimosa is a joke, diluted oj with what tastes like tonic.  Earl grey tea tastes like luke warm colored water.  Coffee comes in a fresh press. I guess it's dark roast.   Restroom is really claustrophobic but clean, right next to kitchen.  I would order challah french toast (really delicious) to go and not eat there. It's over rated in general imo. ",3
" Slightly disappointed in our service.  We showed up on time for our reservation and had to wait a few minutes for a table to open up and be reset.  This would have been completely fine, however we asked for a glass of water while we waited and the host said he would prefer we didn't as there weren't enough supplies for him to give us a glass and to reset the table.    We could have easily brought the water glasses with us as we sat down but instead we felt as though we were being an inconvenience.  It was a beautiful day which made our experience outside very enjoyable, we just wish the service matched the ambiance.  At the end of brunch someone had asked for a to go box.  The servers agreed and then when we were ready to leave it was discovered the food was forgotten about and already thrown away.  We were understanding but it was just another missed opportunity that ended our experience on a bad note. ",2
 This was my first time eating at Olea. I thoroughly enjoyed having brunch here and will return for the Challah Custard Toast! ,5
" Olea is an inventive, delicious menu. Service and ambience are divine, please go! ",5
 Tasty food. Very lovely staff. Great setting. Loved that you could book for brunch ,5
 I found this gem when looking up places to eat while visiting San Francisco's Nob Hill neighborhood. It did not disappoint! My friend and I went for brunch and loved our food. I had the chilaquilles and it was amazing. So flavorful 👍 ,5
" Everything was great!! Only reason for docking a few short stars from perfect was due to the overall noise level. Small place, lower ceilings, so noise level was significantly louder than I would have preferred. That's not anything staff or ownership can control. Other than that,  I'd come back!!! ",5
" Quick, tasty and slightly different. Enjoyed the gnocchi and the pork. ",4
" Absolutely fantastic, fresh, high quality food with excellent, personable service. Our new San Francisco breakfast favorite! ",5
" My husband and I visit San Francisco several times a year and love creative California cuisine. We saw that Olea was rated highly on Trip Advisor and made reservations for Sunday brunch. We are so thrilled we did and also very happy we made reservations!  If you don't make reservations, the wait can be long.  The food was exceptional.  I had the mushroom omelet and my husband had the corn cakes.  Each was delicious with great flavors. Reasonably priced with very friendly (even though very busy) servers.  We will definitely be back and look forward to when they reopen for dinner. ",5
 Arrived promptly at 7:45PM following a 10min walk from our Nob Hill hotel.  Our table was waiting for our party of 2.  We had read the reviews and so were prepared for a small menu with items potentially unavailable with our later seating.  This evening's menu was fabulous - there was nothing I would not have enjoyed.  My wife ordered the Black Cod and I asked our waiter for his suggestion and then chose the lamb shank.  Both mains were excellent balances of flavors and textures.  The bruschetta appetizer was a little too dense. Unfortunately the gazpacho was sold out but the heirloom salad was adequate.  We shared the chocolate bread pudding as the blueberry pie was finished for the day.  It was tasty but a bit heavy.  The wine menu was limited but almost everything was available by the glass.  Service was intelligent and informative.  I was impressed with the final bill... 15-20% less than I have become accustomed to in the bay area for a meal of this caliber.  This is a great neighborhood pick - we will be back again. ,5
" Great food, fresh and inventive! Would definitely come back. ",5
 We had an amazing dinner at Olea.  Service was prompt and personalable. Would recommend and will return. ,5
 Great Gluten free options ,5
 Really enjoyed fresh the fresh ingredients and the creative menu. ,5
" Heard about Olea from a friend and decided to try it out. It was fabulous. Great food, exceptional presentation and a wonderful wine list. I especially enjoyed the unusual parings of local vegetables with fish. My date throughly enjoyed his steak which was tender and not overlooked. The atmosphere was relaxed &amp; casual. The service was very good. We plan on returning next month with friends to try other items on the menu. ",5
 This is one of the best restaurants in San Francisco.  A true neighborhood gem and owners Phillip and Daniel are great hosts. ,5
" The neighborhood restaurant you wish your neighborhood had. Owner is always there, as nice as they come and takes immense pride in his menu. ",5
" Olea is my absolute favorite neighborhood spot!  My boyfriend and I often stop by after work for a delicious dinner and glass of wine, and their weekend brunch is amazing!  Must try the challah French toast! ",5
 My only wish is for larger portions for the price.  Great food and wine though. ,5
 My first time visit was a wonderful experience. The dinner service was very attentive &amp; unobtrusive. The leg of lamb dish was cooked to perfection &amp; full of flavour. Only a small space so an intimate ambience ... and quiet.Will definitely be coming back soon. ,5
" Great service - our server was also the waiter and gave us some great tips and recommendations. The food was wonderful too, although a bit overpriced (not by a lot, but slightly more than others for similar dining experiences). The drink menu was also small. We went for dinner but apparently it is known for brunch. We definitely have to try it for brunch again! ",5
" The waiters were very friendly.  Was disappointed by how limited the menu was and how small the portions were, altho foodcwas prepared well. ",3
 A pleasant surprise down the hill from the Masonic. Would definitely go again. They didn't miss a beat! ,3
" Always looking for out of the way places. This one is small, but the owner knows his stuff and the food is both tasty and nicely presented. It sounds like the selections change on the menu, but we appreciated having good choices for both vegetarian and entrees with meat. Wine selection was not large but it was good, beer selection was more modest. The only real downside was the vanilla gelato we tried at dessert. Don't bother with that one. ",5
 Amazing locally sourced food in the heart of it all ,5
" We continue to love Olea's.  It is our first choice when we are looking for excellent, interesting food in a quiet, warm, and friendly atmosphere.  Always reminds us of dining in NYC without the crowds.  Truly, a neighborhood gem!  Thank you, Olea. ",5
" Our server Philip was very knowledgeable and personable, the food was delicious and the wine list was great--made for a fantastic night out! ",5
" Solid &amp; high-quality, with a special take on comfort food. We especially loved the Confit Chicken Wings-- tender, meaty, and extremely satisfying. ",4
" Hoffman's is a great neighborhood restaurant in a neighborhood that's gotten quite competitive. Their rotisserie chicken and specials (lamb, pork, duck etc...) are consistently excellent and their burger with the pretzel bun and aged cheddar is the best I've had in San Francisco.  They've got excellent wines at decent prices and service is always fast and friendly. You'll leave here with a happy mouth and a full belly :) ",5
 Small place with great food and a seasonal menu. Highly recommended ,5
" Our server on Thursday night was great. She did a great job, even though it was clear the restaurant was possibly short handed and she had to serve all tables. For a server to be able to make us feel like we're not rushed even though she's running around serving 9-11 tables with more +2 on each table, I think she deserves a huge kudos! Especially working in the industry and knowing how tough it is! We started with the roasted cauliflower. Amazing!  I had the beef brisket. The beef was tougher than I like it to be, but the marinade and the broccolini made it so much better. I substituted the potatoes for the chive spätzle and it was so totally worth it. We had the warm cookies for dessert, those were good, but I've definitely had better.  I'll come back to this place for sure. ",5
" Foods were great. It wasn't typical foods you get from the fancy restaurants that follow current trend of San Francisco food scene but Hoffman's foods were very ...homey, portions were great. It is definitely something you can get full out from eating one dish. ",4
" Good food prepared by thoughtful and creative chef who understands very well how to balance a dish. As we're used to in SF, very fresh ingredients. And bravo for the excellent bread. ",4
 Excellent entrees with satisfying portions. ,4
" I don't like to do reviews, but I've had enough great meals at Hoffman's that I feel like I owe it to them . Simple menu but with good variety. Standards are all tasty but specials are always great, such as rotisserie duck and lamb, whole grilled rockfish. Salads are all good- kale caesar, grilled romaine, other. Interesting and creative combinations, but nothing silly or too weird.  A few dollars cheaper than some other places but just as good. Some items for kids too, if parents want a nice meal but need kid-friendly. Fresh, good quality ingredients, Excellent house-ground burger, all wonderfully decadent and yet stuff that's good for you too. Nice atmosphere, not a scene. Friendly, efficient service. Want them to do well and give them credit for good work, but also like having it be a secret. ",4
" What a wonderful neighborhood gem.  From the time we walked in, we felt like special guests at someone's home.  The food was outstanding, particularly for the price;  the service was very good; the entire evening was a delight.  The homemade bread can compete with the best in SF. ",4
" I brought a group of 6 to celebrate a birthday - 5 arrived on time and the birthday guest was late.  Everyone enjoyed great American comfort food and I do mean great comfort food.  We had  pork, chicken, lamb, and great sides.  There is something for everyone, generous portions and the price value makes me want to eat hear at least 3 times a week.  While you are waiting please have a cocktail at the Lone Palm and come to Hoffman's for great food, wine and beer.  We all loved it. ",4
" Good value, nice portions. ",4
" It was rainy night, so it was kinda of quiet, but that meant we got really good service.  The food was solid.  There were two of us.  We shared everything.  Cauliflower appetizer was superb. Sausage and eggplant appetizer was good.  We shared a whole roasted chicken that was very, very good.  And nice to take home leftovers.  I'll most likely be back! ",3
 Good value. ,3
 I had the 1/2 rotisserie chicken -it was very good -tasted like real chicken- no fat. also noise level was good - finally a place where one can talk ,4
 Taken immediately to our reserved table...took a little while for a server to stop by our table so we were thinking this wasn’t going to be a good experience...but once they did the rest of the evening was surprising delightful. Very limited menu but our choices of hamburger and calamari were excellent!  Drinks were good—(but I wish they had blue cheese olives for my martini) Michael was our friendly host/server and he’s the one who noticed we hadn’t been served. He took very good care of us the rest of the evening and made our experience a positive. I would definitely go back! ,5
" It was pouring rain when we arrived for our 6:30 pm Friday night reservation. The place was still relatively quiet and empty. We were sat in the big picture window in the dining room looking out on the street and Christmas decorations on neighboring buildings. It was dark and rainy outside, but so cozy inside with little lights and the yummy smells from the rotisserie. Our waiter came over and recommended some very delicious sounding appetizers, and then brought wine. It was a perfect evening full of fun and good food. Followed by scrumptious desserts. Even going back out into the rain after dinner was ok. We will definitely go back. ",5
 The food was thoughtfully and well prepared and presented.  The grilled items are especially a good choice for future diners and I think their specialty.  The service was excellent and our wait person was friendly and considerate.  Parking for non walkers can be challenging but the nearby lot at Bartlett is convenient and just a short walk. ,4
" Reviews were so great yet the 3 of us were disappointed.  Our meat dishes (ham and beef brisket) were not just dry, they were crunchy (and not yummy char broiled kind of crunchy.)   And it's hard to ruin ham in my opinion.   Service was fine but very slow.  Turned out ok for us because we wanted to linger and catch up - the room was quiet and simple and nice.  but... the food... Wanted to love it so much but sadly won't ever return. ",2
" What a gem!  Delicious food, generous portions, terrific service.  The steak was one of the best we've ever had, and both the pork and chicken dishes did not disappoint. We will definitely be coming back on a regular basis, very welcoming restaurant. ",4
" We went around 930 PM, the restaurant was winding down in terms of customers. Meant that it was quiet, service was spot-on, quite enjoyable. We split the pate appetizer between the two of us, served with some toasted bread seasoned with olive oil and sea salt - a great combo (although I did end up with heartburn in the wee hours of the morning, but that is always the case when I do rich, creamy pate. I should have countered with an antacid.) I then had the burger, my partner had the short ribs. Both were very well prepared. We will definitely be heading back, with the kid in tow. ",5
" This was our first meal at Hoffman's. I started with the roasted cauliflower (a side dish), then had the grilled Ahi tuna special as my main. Both were really flavorful, nicely sized, and perfectly cooked. My wife started with the kale Caesar salad, then had the clam chowder. The chowder is listed as a starter but it was in a full-sized bowl and made a nice entree. I snuck a bite of each and they were delicious. The wines we had were lovely and the service was great. I'm sure we'll be back. ",4
" Enjoyed all courses that were ample and a good value.  Wine list was superbly matched but the best part was the excellent service.  Very comfortable, casual dining room---will be back again and again! ",4
" A great place.  We had 4 people.  The service was excellent, the kale ceasar was great; the brisket was the best I ever had and everything was served timely.  You have to ask for bread and we forgot to ask, so that was a disappointment because the bread looked delicious.  But, for the price, they served enough food and we enjoyed everything. ",4
" I made my reservations for Thursday at 6pm, but on my reminder for open table it had it on the system as Friday at 6 pm. This was also what they had at the restaurant. When I opened the email link it showed my Thursday time at 6 pm.  There is a problem with your site. We over heard another party who reservations wa also not found in system. Lucky they had overflow seating but it was outside the dining room. Food was fine but we didn't seem to get the attention experienced on previous visit possibility due to where we where seated. ",3
 Great place to get hearty meals that are locally produced and will certainly leave you with a full stomach. I'd recommend the beef burger and the filleted trout lying on the bed of salad. ,4
" A quaint, quiet, friendly, neighborhood establishment where the owner runs the room and the food is very good! ",5
" Perfect cozy little neighborhood bistro with an inventive menu of quality seasonal cuisine  and excellent warm, friendly service. Great wine list too. Perfect place for catching up with friends and unwinding. Also one of the best brunch menus in town....If you can get in. ",5
" This neighborhood gem offers the most creative, some of the most delicious food on Nob Hill.  The wine-by/the-glass list is extensive and reasonable. The owner,waiter, maitre 'd is gracious  and knowledgeable.  Olea deserves 5 stars. ",5
 Friends from Hawaii were in town and we took them here. It was a wonderful experience! Great food and amazing service! ,5
" Overpriced and out of stock, below average overall. Neighborhood spot has potential but falls short.  Booked a table at 7:15 pm on a Friday evening for a dinner date, and walked in to the underground dining room which was cool. Service was slow, and the seasonal menu was small enough as it is, but they were out of a few of the items on the already-limited menu (understandable if it was late but this was just after 7 o'clock). There was a seasonal vegetable paparadelle but they didn't have the paparadelle and substituted linguini instead, they were out of 1 out of 4 appetizers, and 1 out of 4 entrees. I got the lobster bisque which sounded promising but was diluted (tasted like it was watered down to save ingredient costs), nowhere near the consistency of a bisque. The filet cost $39 and was acceptable but nowhere near the premium cost - I am happy to pay that for a great steak experience, this was not. Space was sparsely decorated and noise traveled, there was a group of ladies at the table behind to us who talked loud enough to disrupt our meal, and I don't think they were talking especially loud, just that the noise bounced off the walls and floor.   Last nitpick: the host/server couldn't pronounce ""bouillabaisse"" - he pronounced the ""l's"" and couldn't talk to its composition adequately, this matters if you're going to offer a specifically French dish on your menu. Oh, and they did not have 1 out of 2 fishes included in the bouillabaisse. ",2
" Bring cash to tip the live jazz ensemble (they were swinging hard) which plays from a high ceiling stage (good acoustics), very surreal, and poetic, perfect for North Beach; City Lights book store (browse &amp; buy a book before or after dinner) within two blocks walking distance. Check out the beers on tap, only two, but there will be something good. Cocktails were expertly made. Sit back, eat (small menu, but very tasty; the fried calamari and beet &amp; goat cheese salad were spot on, instant favorites, excited to taste other items). Drink, enjoy SF like the Beats would, taking it all in, not in a hurry, not on smart phones, instead bop to the jazz. Tip the waitstaff well. Cheers! ",4
" The waitress told us all tables were reserved and our only option was to sit at the bar. I reserved a table on Open table, came back, and was seated by the manager. The waitress was disgruntled and quite rude the whole evening. Sit your customers where they feel most comfortable and welcome them into your establishment, especially when you have EMPTY TABLES. ",4
 The service at Comstock was great and cocktails fantastic! ,5
" Comstock is my favorite bar in SF. Their cocktails are spirit-heavy, always balanced, and the location is very adult. I want these guys to be around for the next 20 years, doing it just how they do it. ",5
" The venue has great ambiance, however due to its size it is very crowded. Our reserved table was literally right next to the double open doors, which in winter is a bit chilly. Oysters, ribs, and fries were delicious. The burger bun was soggy, and the flavor was “blah”.  Beers on tap are great! Vodka martini and Irish coffee were great, especially if you enjoy a strong drink.  We initially went for the live Jazz music which was enjoyable, but the small space minimized the experience. The wait staff and service were excellent!! Overall a good experience, just not what we were hoping for. ",3
 Yummy small plates and adventurous cocktails ,5
 The cabernet wasn't great. Go there for the Gin ,3
" Outstanding service &amp; I don’t ever say that.  Great drinks.  Well done, Comstock. ",5
 Been here before and had a GREAT time. However this evening they were understaff and it showed. ,4
" A place to get a reservation and get gussied up for. Too loud to feel awkward, and wonderful ambiance. ",5
" We really enjoyed our Friday Free Lunch. It was a delicious butternut squash salad with arugula, bacon, marscapone and candied pecans. Cassidy was our server and she was very professional and kind. ",5
 Awesome staff. Very accommodating. Great atmosphere. ,5
" Had a 6:30 reservation in the dining room and weren't seated until 7:15. They made room for us in the bar but I would call this a service blunder. Food was good and service was good following that, but they could improve upon seating logistics. ",3
" The service was great. The cocktails were fantastic. I really enjoyed the live music. However, I ordered the shishito peppers, pappardelle, and the half chicken. The pappardelle was WAY too salty, and I like a lot of salt. The half chicken was good.  The shishito peppers were my favorite part of the meal. ",3
" Had a great time with friends celebrating the bachelor party. Good drinks &amp; food, and high level service. ",5
" Interesting venue, delightful live music, authentic cocktails AND super excellent comfort-type food (roasted half-chicken, lamb w/ pappardelle).  Service friendly and efficient.  Limited vegetarian options. ",5
" The live music + cocktail combo was perfect for a mid week get-together! However, the food was quite average (and pricey for the quality) and service was slow. Would come back for the live music with drinks/bar snacks for not for dinner. ",3
" Good artisan cocktails and bar.  The small plate food was limited.  Our brussel sprouts were overcooked and too salty.  We had olives, but there were no artisan cheeses or meats.  We left the table were we were put for our reservation and took seats at the bar.  The bar had a much better atmosphere. ",3
 They put a reservation sign on our table while we were still finishing our drinks at the end of our meal. We also asked for a special table as it was our honeymoon and we were put in the corner by their coffee equipment. Did not meet our expectations and did not feel welcome. ,2
" This is a very cool bar. It would be great to meet friends at and enjoy their unique cocktails. However we went directly from the airport for a nice bite to eat. The menu was very limited and nothing looked appealing. To recap. The cocktails were very good. Nice Jazz Band, great decor, not a dinner place, very loud, most other tables appeared to enjoy the oysters. ",3
" lamb sausage sandwich on fresh grilled sourdough roll was great. We also had the dinner portions (large servings, including sides) of the grilled chicken. The side of grilled brussels sprouts was tasty, very done, and popcorn like, with an unusual sauce that had some garum (fish sauce) tanginess, but wasn't fishy at all. Great cocktails, esp. the bourbon drinks. Very fast service. Both the bar stools and the table-booths were comfortable (although not roomy if you are a large peraon). Will return. ",5
" The host was awesome. We got there about an hour before our reservations. There was no open seats available but the host recommended a little table and chairs outside while we waited. We had a drink and people watched. Our host was kind and tentative and before we knew it we were seated. Great place, love the jazz music. The menu is small but we enjoyed it. ",5
 This was a very negative experience. The food was AWFUL and it was EXPENSIVE!!!! And the waitress was bored. Threw $75 away for LUNCH???? And could not eat the food. ,1
" Dinner was fantastic - the shared starters of brussel sprouts, calamari, and oysters were delicious. In fact, the oysters were so good I opted to to double down on oysters as a main, too. The half roast chicken was the best I have ever had - it must have been brined for days and was cooked to perfection. Cocktails, of course, were fabulous! ",5
" From the first moment when I was greeted by name, then through our visit, the service was professional and friendly. Most importantly, the food was fabulous and the drinks first-rate ",5
" A classic causal while sophisticated experience. Brilliant food, creative cocktail menu, live music and attentive staff all working to make your experience spectacular. Worth a mention, the decor! ",5
" More of a cocktails + bar food place than a proper restaurant. The food that they serve is decent but  it's a very limited menu, so not a good choice for a sit-down meal w/ family on a Saturday evening. Service was also inattentive and quite slow. (Although they were quick to bring a check!) ",3
" Love this spot! The food has been consistently impressive, exceeding our expectations for a fairly casual, night-time spot. The portions are fairly generous. The drinks are interesting. The music is wonderful, though at times way too loud -- we found conversation difficult on a couple of occasions. One other downside was that there are sometimes flies all around. We'll definitely be back again and again, but really hoping the flies stay away :P ",4
" I had a very nice impression the first time I came in. I finally chose it to meet some friends after a trip because of the nice vibe and the jazz music. We couldn't see the musician from our seats but sounded very well, charming and smooth. The food was pretty good but portions could be bigger. Nevertheless I'm looking forward to come back. I like it much! ",5
 Menu is limited but very tasty. Service was great and drinks are well prepared.  Live music (jazz)  was very nice. ,5
" The menu is limited but relatively well executed; it is a classic menu, with few surprises and little to excite a sophisticated palate.  I would go for the live music (which was excellent), the cocktails and the ambiance, and if you are interested in a piece of SF history.  The historic space is reminiscent of a British pub, and dinner seating is largely wooden booths and bar stools. ",3
" Amazing salads, Pasta, and Chicken. Great cocktails. Friendly attentive staff. A little pricey but seems worth it. ",5
 Fantastic bar/restaurant. Everyone was polite and very accommodating. ,5
" Service was slow but friendly, and the food was delicious. We couldn't get it down fast enough. That banana bourbon dessert is everything. ",5
" We enjoyed the kale salad. Clam chowder was much better than most you get. Though the rotisserie chicken had a perfect golden skin, it was a tad dry. The potatoes that came with it were delicious. Service is friendly &amp; efficient. This is a great neighborhood cafe. ",4
 Food quality isn't particularly great. Service is good though. ,2
" Yes, it was nice good.  The pork belly was 10% meat &amp; 90% fat though I'm told it's suppose to be like that.  Chicken a bit on the dry side so about the same quality as made at home. ",3
" Very laid-back, no-fuss atmosphere with delicious, well-executed food.  Home-cooked meals elevated to restaurant level. Highly recommended ",5
" since dining there the time before, they've added a rotisserie for chicken and the chicken does look good.   Server was a bit disingenuous when he asked whether we wanted water - still or sparkling - i assumed that both were house-provided, but then he brought an open bottle of pellegrino, for which there was a hefty charge.  the menu has been cut back since the last time - the burgers and vegetables were good - but not good enough for another visit.  wait staff seemed to be understaffed, as service was slow.    television was on loud and detracted from the meal.  an adequate restaurant, but with the large number in the area, probably not a restaurant i'll frequent again. ",3
" This is my new favorite place. The food is fantastic and really reasonably priced.  We had the burger, which was the best I've had in the city!  The Pork Flat Iron was so delicious! Also, the Lamb Meatballs! The bread, which I was told is made daily, is incredible. I had the cheesecake for desert. It was topped with a blueberry compote.  Yum!  I'll be back for sure! ",5
" Made a reservation for 2 at 915 and the waiter still made us wait when there clearly was an open table available. Waited 10 minutes to finally be sat at the table which was open when we originally got there. WASTE OF TIME.   Food was okay at best. We ordered the mussels-SUPER SMALL, the chicken wings-OVER RATED, DRY, CAME OUT TOO HOT TO EVEN TOUCH, roasted cauliflower-SOUR, and the pork chops-ONLY GAVE US TWO SMALL PIECES, NOT WORTH THE PRICE.  Service was okay as well. The waiter/waitress? Who sat us had really stinky breath and did not know what she was doing. Our server who brought us food was very nice though.  Experience was okay. DOES NOT LIVE UP TO THE HYPE. I WOULD NOT COME BACK ",3
" I was excited to visit here after reading all the positive reviews.  Our experience was entirely mediocre.   It broke down this way:  Service - good.    Ambiance - good Food - fair  Here's what we ate:  grilled romaine salad - my wife liked it, I thought it was like every similar salad I was offered about a decade ago when grilling lettuce was in vogue, i.e. a waste of perfectly good lettuce spaetzle - sounded much better than it tasted pork belly main - creative, well-executed, and very good   panisse - disappointing house pinot - good  All-in-all, while we did not hate the meal we had, and really liked parts of it, neither of us is anxious to return.  However, I can well understand why others would be more enthusiastic. ",3
" Delicious seasonal food, amazing rotisserie meats, comfortable low-key neighborhood vibe ",4
" I was really expecting a great time when I read some of the reviews online.  I had to ask for a server after waiting over 10 minutes with nothing but menus.  Once the server approached us, she never apologized for the long wait.  I don't think I'll be going back. ",3
 Honest straightforward food ,5
" The food was really outstanding, so glad to have a new neighborhood go to place off the heavily traveled Valencia Street! ",5
" After my second visit, this is my new favorite restaurant.  The addition of Dan Wagner is a definite plus !!!!! ",5
" I brought a group of friends for dinner before theatre on Valencia. We all loved the burgers and rotisserie chicken. Nice, cozy atmosphere. Enjoyed the music which wasn't too loud. It's a great find. I'll be recommending to my friends who want good food, modest prices, nice atmosphere, easy access to transit. Good service. ",5
" Everything was great except my husband's burger.  He likes it well done, but because the burger was a hybrid burger-meat ball shape, it was med rare in the middle.  Loved the pork dish - yum!  Nice salads.  Exceptionally good service. ",4
" If you have people who need just standard, easy dining, take them here.  Menu is good for kids, picky eaters and there's nothing that is complicated.  It's a pleasant change to too many over complex menus.  Easy to choose, tasty to eat.  My only issue is that it'd be good to get a draught lager... didn't seem to be much choice on the menu of bottled beers. ",4
 Really enjoyed our meal here.  It was nice and quiet - so perfect for our group of 5.   The service was great and the food was outstanding -- we had the special; tri tip with a marvelous twice baked potato and broccolini.  I will come back for sure.  Great find. ,5
" Weds night, 7:30 res, not busy (2 4 tops, several deuces), adequate floor staff (2 wait, host, maybe bartender). Bit of wait for initial drink order, then more waiting for the drinks - 2 half liters of tap wine.   Simple dinner order: 1 hamburger, medium, &amp; my wife decides on Lamb Meatballs and Cauliflower side for a light dinner. Bit of a wait for the food and we had to ask for bread. The burger was small and well done on a large, over toasted bun - not a good bun to meat ratio. The grilled onions were mostly blackened onions and not in a good way. The first aroma I smelled when served was 'burned'. I swapped the fries for Brussel Sprouts that were supposed to be cooked with bacon though I couldn't detect any. The pickled vegetables were a nice condiment with the mayo and ketchup sides. Mustard would have been nice.   The Lamb Meatballs were well done and nicely presented - reminiscent of the Turkish place across the street.  The cauliflower side was delivered later and was flavorful and perfectly gratineed.   We were seated in the back by the bread station. I sort of appreciate young tushes occasionally whisking by my face as I get older but not so much my wife. It did make it easy to get more dipping oil for the bread though.   There was nothing about the experience that would compel a return visit. They weren't busy but the service was - distracted - and the food OK but not great. ",2
 The food and service were great. But the best part about this restaurant is it's calm atmosphere.  You can actually hold a conversation with your friends! ,5
" Group of 6 of us went here for NYE dinner. We got mussels and the chicken confit wings to start - both were amazing! The bread was also top notch. I got the duck rotisserie special, which was outstanding. The burger and steaks were also good. The other two people in our group got the scallops - some were slightly undercooked but overall they were very delicious, just a smaller portion than the other stuff. Last time I was here the service was slow but this time they were attentive, quick, nice, full of recommendations, and all around great. ",4
" My chicken was to die for, the egg nog creme brulee was stunning, and the mussels might have been the best ones I have ever had. ",5
" The location is an easy 10 minute walk from 24th BART station. We sat in a window nook, that gave a great view of the neighborhood passing us as we ate. I had the pasta special with squash and it was absolutely wonderful. I'll go again and order it immediately, if it is still the pasta special. A companion had the half-chicken (rotisserie style) and thoroughly enjoyed it. One other companion had the pork and enjoyed it as well. All of us said we'd return again, perhaps to try something else or simply (in my case) to repeat what we ate. The price was reasonable, a bit over $25 per person: dinner, one glass of wine, taxes included but prior to tip. Service was a bit slow but the chef provided us with dessert, ""on the house"", for the delay. That was a nice gesture. All in all, we were pleased that we tried Hoffman's and we'll return. ",4
" First time at Hoffman Grill after they changed ownership.  Some of the menu items and wait staff are the same.  Food was very good, and the portions are good for the price.  Definitely try the steak and the cioppino.  I would definitely go back. ",4
" We were visiting SF from the Midwest, and it was a daunting task to select a restaurant with so many good options available. We lucked into Company. Great ambience, mussels, limited but outstanding menu. Will definitely return. ",5
" An undiscovered, underappreciated neighborhood gem in the land of the foodies.  It was previously called Company, but Karen Hoffmann,the chef, took over the restaurant from the previous owner and has made some changes, notably adding a rotisserie and improving the atmosphere.    She is a chef with a special intelligence, which is shown in the food.  The menu changes, but some stand-out items are the chicken wings confit (appetizer), the fried artichokes, the patés, anything from the rotisserie, (but particularly the ham, or the pork), the burger, believe it or not, the steak, the pastas, the cauliflower.  Simple food, but with touches such as homemade ketchup, etc.  Also, I think, arguably the best bread in SF.  Desserts are good, as are cheese selections.  The wine list is a little pedestrian.  Service is genial and effective. ",5
" Lovely meal. The food was prepared with care, attractively composed and plated. There was a seasonal focus to the ingredients, for instance the persimmon salad was a favorite at the table. From burger to salmon, the entrees on the table were all well executed. The design of the interiors is clean and fresh, mod without being overly, a great place for wine with friends or even a special date. Can't beat the neighborhood. I'll be back. ",4
 Service is a bit lacking that night... Food was good. ,3
" Epic! Fantastic! Best Bar North of Market! We go there every time we come back to San Fran.  On second thought don't go, it will get too crowded.  Yeah, that's it. ",5
 The music stole the show. Live jazz and the historic decor were both amazing. And the maitre d was a sweetheart. ,5
" I love Comstock and their cocktails. They have live music over the weekends and have some of the best cocktails that I've tasted in the North beach area. They're also a short walk away from Chinatown and Little Italy, so its perfectly placed if you're going out for drinks after/before dinner in these districts.  The barkeep's whimsy never disappoints and bar seating shows you the process, which is realy very intricate. ",5
 We had a lovely time enjoying drinks with friends before heading to Speakeasy SF. ,4
" The Comstock Saloon was a surprise find for us. We expected the typical bar/restaurant but found something quite different.  The food was superb.  We started with the fried Brussels sprouts, grilled octopus, and roasted squash soup.  They were all really good, though the squash soup probably had more cream than squash in it (which might be a plus for many people.)  We each chose the  duck confit as the main course, and it was crisp and juicy.  The live music was great. We got to listen to Katy Stephan on piano, singing a wide range of songs, and she was wonderful.   The drinks, the attentiveness of the staff, the decor, all made the experience there a special one, and we will be back there when we return to San Francisco. ",5
 This little restaurant is delightful with a wait staff that attends to your every need. Food is great and the service is not pushy. Whatever your pace this is just the place to relax and enjoy your evening. ,5
" Fantastic food, great value and friendly service. I'm from the UK where they have the best Indian restaurants. This is the only place I've found where the food quality compares. I was happy to see it so busy, and it is definitely worth the drive to Novato. ",5
" A real find. Food quality, taste and presentation are all excellent. Service staff is professional, attentive and friendly. Anyone who likes good Himalayan/Indian fare will want to frequent this Marin County gem.  If you haven't wandered the charming streets of Novato, don't miss the chance for an after dinner stroll. ",5
 Our favorite Indian restaurant in Marin. Had a lovely time with friends. Lots of great flavors. Everything was delicious. ,5
" The food here never misses a beat. Service is impeccable. All the dishes are full of flavor, and the staff will help you balance out your choices so you get a good sampling of dishes. ",4
" Immediately after we entered the restaurant, we were shown to the table I had requested. However, as the Novato night was absolutely stunning, we chose to sit outside in a nicely laid out patio. Service was impeccable, our server was happy to answer any questions we had, water and before dinner gnosh arrived within moments after we were seated. Our meal was delicious, the wine choices limited but a good selection. Batika India Bistro is on my list of returns in Novato. ",5
" Three of us recently had dinner at Batika India in Novato...what a surprise! One of the three is a real foodie when it comes to Indian food and ranked this restaurant's dishes as right up there with Vij's in Vancouver, B.C. The palak paneer was the best we have had. One of our party then had the Thale vegetarian plate...every dish was excellent and enough food we brought some home for our son's dinner the next night. Two of us had the Chicken Tikka Masaala--delicious! We definitely will return! ",5
" Food was freshly made and delicious. Best ingredients used. Friendly, professional staff. ",4
" This really is one of my most favorite places to get away too. Food, service and energy are all so good. It's wonderful love the food of this lovely country. Go out and treat yourself to something delicious. Saturday nights get busy so worth a booking. ",5
 It took me awhile to find this place and I'm so happy I gave it a try. Welcoming with outstanding food. If you hunger for authentic Indian food this is the place to go. ,5
" Lunch buffet is smaller than most, but better quality. Dinner was wonderful. Staff very nice. Probably some of best Indian food in Marin County. ",4
" it keeps getting better! the best service, food and pace of the meal . . . ",5
" This is the best Indian food in the North Bay that I know of, or for that matter san francisco, though Anohka down the street is a not-distant second. The flavors are fresher than usual but still with nice depth and complexity sometimes lacking in more modern Indian restaurants. Only small grip is I asked for ""Hot- very hot- as in REALLY HOT"" and got moderately hot for the salmon entrée. The other three dishes were perfectly medium and delicious and the bill seemed quite low ($75 including 2 glasses wine) ",5
" Delicious and varied entrees and side dishes. Excellent, personable service. Perfect romantic dining. ",4
 Good Indian food. Our friends had told us that it is the best in Marin... qand e-mailed us a list of their 8 favorite dishes. ,4
 Wonderful food and great service. ,4
" The service was excellent, the atmosphere welcoming and the quality of the ingredients were top notch and cooked to the right degree. But, if the seasoning of our food was the norm it is far to bland and I am not just talking about the heat. The flavors I normally associate with Indian cooking were just plain lacking. Because of that we will probably not return but if we ever do I will make sure to have a discussion about both the level of spiciness and the strength of other seasonings. For those of you who normally have to request your food extra mild, this is the place for you! ",3
" The ground lamb kebab was wonderful ! Highly recommend, excellent and friendly service as well. Looking forward to trying other dishes, this was our first visit here. Yummy. ",4
 Good food and excellent value. Very friendly service. Worth the extra miles of driving to Novato. ,4
 A good quiet place with excellent customer service. One of the best Indian restaurants out there in Novato. ,5
 A small and cozy restaurant that provides good food and good service at a reasonable price. Wonderful mid-week occasion. ,4
 terrific food quality--was surprised it was so great. and we have fussy eaters. ,5
" This place knows how to cook and please! Flavorful, tender food and surprising wine list that's very affordable. Some of the best Indian food I've had in the greater Bay Area. ",5
" I hadn't lunched here in over a year, and I remember the food being a bit better then. The food was pretty good though and I wouldn't hesitate recommending this restaurant to my friends and associates. ",4
" This was our first time at this restaurant and we had a thoroughly enjoyable meal. We started with the appetizer BBQ plate (Shish Kababs &amp; Chicken) which was scrumptious (and large, we had to take a few pieces home. This was followed by Lamb Vindaloo and Chicken Tikka Masala. The lamb was tender and the masala (gravy) was delicious. The chicken was tender and very tasty. The dishes are quite large and we were able to bring some of the chicken home. We like our curries to be hot and spicy, and the chef obliged. The food was quite spicy and to our taste. Service was fast and efficient. We will definitely go back. ",4
 it seemed that the restaurant was brand new because of how flustered the wait staff was with a busy saturday dinner crowd.  the food was good. ,3
" We absolutely loved every single thing we ordered, even the coffee. I am not usually a big Indian food fan, I only like certain things, but I have to say, this is the best Indian food I've ever had, and my husband, who loves Indian food, couldn't get enough of this place. I can't wait to come back with friends! ",5
" The food and service were great. We really enjoyed the cheese/onion naan, chicken, etc. ",4
" My expectations were not met. While there is no question that the food is good, unfortunately there is better Indian on the same street let alone in San Rafael and Petaluma. The flavors seemed muted from the complimentary papadums, thru the samosas and on thru the tandoori chicken and especially the sheek* kabob. Also heat was missing perhaps because I was not asked and did not think to request medium rather than mild. The highlights were the complimentary carrot chutney and the lassi. I was also disappointed that neither the waiter nor the man who seemed to be in charge were aware of the allergies I alerted them to on my open table reservation. *menu spelling ",3
" We were extremely impressed when the chef/owner came to our table to ask if the ""spicy"" lamb vindaloo was to our liking or not (it was!), but no one has every asked that question! Later, when we asked the waiter what spices made another lamb dish so delicious, the chef came back - amazing! Honestly, I dont know why I asked, because I know I can never duplicate it.  We will definitely be back. In fact, I really want to support great food like this in Novato! It's about time! When we first moved here therestaurant choices were abysmal. So glad to have Batika here. ",4
" Novato now boasts two amazing Indian cusine eateries. Batika blends a unique spice bouquet into their dishes while not overwhelming them with curry or peppers. The staff is pleasant, friendly, helpful. The manager is great and reads online requests for special elements like Happy Birthday messages. I always enjoy introducing new guests to this wonderful place. Namaste! ",5

" Batika India Bistro makes me curious. It always seems empty. Dead. At any moment ready to close up shop. And I don't understand why. It's fantastic. I learned about good Indian food in London. There you see quality Indian food is not ""everything smothered in curry"". You get a full mouth of sweets, savories and everything in between. Only at Batika have I experienced the same style.  Maybe that's why is not packed....Americans only know one kind of Indian food...the American kind. Fine with me...always a table available when I want to go. ",4
" Very good Indian standards. Menu is a bit limited but very well done. Service was great, very friendly and helpful. Good place for a date night or a dinner with the family. Wine menu is limited. ",4
 What a great place; can't wait to eat there again! I hope the locals support Batika so it'll be around for a long time. ,4
" This is a great restaurant in downtown Novato. I am looking forward to going back in the summer when we can sit outside on the patio. We ordered Chicken Tikka Masala, Dahl, saffron rice and Naan bread--it was all delicious. We asked the chef/owner if they use MSG as another reviewer stated, and we are pleased to report NO MSG!! ",5
 Too much MSG in the food.... I couldn't get enought water all night! ,3
 Prompt seating and a nice atmosphere. Enjoy it every time. Especially the deviled eggs. ,5
 Bollywood Tea and sticky buns are awesome! Staff is friendly and welcoming! ,5
" First-time visit, we were looking for a place that took reservations. This place had plenty of availability,which is sometimes a signal the place isn't good, but that was not a correlation here. I really enjoyed the inventive food and the vegetarian dish was surprisingly flavorful. It was vegan and wasn't just a bunch of veggies thrown together and served over a trendy grain. Actually had flavor and left me feeling satiated! The appetizers of mini-fried chicken sandwiches and deviled eggs were great.  Although, one does have to stop and think about paying $2 for 1/2 egg.  The butter-scotch pot de creme for dessert was also tasty.  We'll totally be back! ",5

" My friends and I went here for Restaurant Week. They had a really good deal. 2 appetizers (deviled egg and popcorn), one starter dish, a main dish, and dessert. The pappardelle with pork cheeks had really good flavors. The salmon was very crispy and was cooked perfectly. ",4
" get the tables at the front windows on a nice day...  i made a 12:45 rsvp for 1 but didn't make it til 3, their closing time. i called and the hostess was sweet to offer to wait for me.  originally i wanted to have their prix fix lunch offered during SF restaurant wk.  most menu items looked creative.  but lost my appetite by time of arrival.  so, i ordered kale salad and popped elote: buttered popcorn with chili, lime, cotija cheese.  popcorn was disappointing:  some pieces were tough and stale tasting;  also too salty.  it was like a salad drenched in salty dressing.  the waitress said they made it fresh.  so i just turned it back.  i think it would taste much better if the popcorn was tossed evenly w/ other ingredients and a bit less of them. and it would have been a nicer experience if the waitress had offered something else. ",3
" The space itself reminded me of a quaint hipster restaurant with wooden tables and large artwork decorating the walls. The food was pretty expensive for what you get, but was pretty good overall. The service was outstanding though! I probably wouldn't go back. Seemed like an overpriced brunch place. ",4
 Visited Myriad for SF Restaurant Week with a few friends. We arrived in time for 2 happy hour drinks. The food was great. We loved the deviled eggs the pork and pot de creme. Would definitely visit again! ,4
 Love this place! I can't bring myself to try anything else on the menu since the French toast is so amazing. My fiancé had the shaksuka which was also very good. ,5
" We booked a lunch for 4 people and overall had a good experience.  The food was  very tasty, fresh,  good portions and friendly waiter.  The deviled eggs are delicious, be sure to order 2 for yourself, 1 just won't do :) Our only issue in general was that only 1 egg (vs 2) was served with the Mayan pork hash - it really needs the extra egg, especially for a brunch dish.  We also thought the prices were a bit overpriced by $2-3 per plate.  We will still come back to this restaurant to try other dishes and dinner in the future, it's got a great vibe. ",4

" We'd meant to come here for a while, and finally had a chance. The waiter was aggressive to get our orders going given the somewhat empty space. The ""snacks"" were tasty - we had the potato chips and pickled vegetables.  The main dishes were good but not memorable. We had the Salmon on lentils and the hangar steak. Hangar steak was requested to be medium rare but was decidedly medium/well done.  Over all, this place was ok, but too expensive for us to return for this quality. ",2

" This time was another birthday celebration with two friends, with whom I've dined here before.  And the more one eats at Myriad, the more one wants to return and return and return.  We brought our own two bottles of wine for the celebration, and the corkage fee was very reasonable.  The birthday boy had the pappardelle with pork cheeks, etc while the other two had the exquisite grilled hangar steak with those most marvelous, magical potatoes.  We started out with our usual farm toast appetizer; and also tried a new appetizer on the menu - the ""autumn gratin"" - roasted butternut squash, goat cheese, sage, cherries.  Then we had two marvelous desserts that the three of us shared.  And as with my other friends, we just keep coming back and back and back!  We'll always find a myriad of reasons to come back to Myriad! ",5
" This was my first brunch at Myriad with two friends; and again, the experience was delightful, delicious and d'wonderful!  We started out with the most exquisite mouth-watering goat cheese &amp; chive biscuits with local honey butter and home made preserves - each small biscuit was treasured and cherished - and we could have eaten dozens instead of the rest of our brunch - they were so good.  At the same time, as this was the first time these friends had come with me to Myriad, I also ordered the farm toast with goat cheese, persimmons, etc - which my friends also found delicious.  They tend to be rather critical, but each had the grass-fed beef burger, that they found absolutely delicious.  I had the shakshuka - tunisian tomato poached eggs - which again, was so delicious, I craved even more.  Then there usual wonderful desserts.  Every meal here is a delight and a wonder!  Thank you, Myriad! ",5

" Delicious food, excellent service. Can't wait to go back. The shrimp and grits were incredible. ",5
" Not sure why this place came in as one of the top brunch spots in the city. I had the pork hash and both the pork and the potatoes were dry. My BF had the egg sandwich, which was also only average. The waiter was neither friendly nor attentive. All in all, it was very average, which would be fine had I not been expecting something in the top 10. Maybe our bar is lowering--sure hope not! ",2
" What fun!  Chef Tracey has created a wonderful new spot in the Mission.  The dishes are perfect for sharing  (or keeping for yourself).  The Market salad was a delight with creamy bits of avocado, peppery coins of radish and a bright citrus vinaigrette.  We shared the chicken sandos they had a nice crisp crust and a hint of spice with the crunchy slaw.  The hanger steak was cooked to perfection.  Don't miss the fruit crisp...served piping hot with icecream!  The service was a delight, knowledgeable and personable without  hovering.  Can't wait to go back and check out the rest of the menu.

 We had the pleasure of dining here recently and wow were we impressed.  The Snacks and Small Plates are perfect so you can get a few different things for sharing or go right for the entrees.  We chose to do some sharing items instead of entrees.  We started with one of their signature dishes Deviled Eggs.  Who doesn't love a deviled egg.  The flavors were bright and the radish added a spice component to the egg.  Another great one were the peaches with goat cheese mousse I could have liked the plate it was so yummy.  I love the tang you get from goat cheese.  We tried the heirloom tomatoes with a balsamic reduction and burrata cheese (two words: More Please).  The tomatoes were a special so they may not be there when you go in.  The fried chicken sammies were so good.   I also recommend the grits.  Then onto the encore of the meal the desserts.  We had the zeppoles.  They came out piping hot and oh so delicious and of course a classic pot a creme.  I say this place is Stellar because there are so many things on the menu that I wanted to try that I can't wait for my next return there. ,5
" My friends and I were happy to discover Myriad lacked the pretense of other Mission newcomers, but was not short on or creative, flavorful cuisine. Lovely addition. May it not become overrun and continue to cater to true SF locals. ",4
 Perfect place for date night!  A unique and eclectic menu (with the dishes proving to be even tastier than they sounded) and a knowledgeable and friendly server made this a great night out! ,5
" We go to Black Angus every once in a while, they have excellent prime rib, and thier steaks are pretty good also.  The service was very good, and attentive.  We will go back. ",4

 We had one of the best waitresses we've ever had. ,5
" Ambiance needs a more classic or modern feel, one or the other.  As for the dressing with salad, it would be nice to offer blue cheese crumbles when blue cheese dressing is ordered.

" We've been searching for quite some time for a go-to Indian place for our family in Marin, and we've found it. After living for ten years in London, our standards for great Indian food are high, and we had yet to find anything that really came close in Marin. We had a meal there last week with my two kids, and was really happy with the quality of the food. Only complaint we had was about some shrimp that simply weren't cooked enough. The rest of the dishes were great, the kids were happy, and so were we since we now have a go-to Indian place. ",4
" Amazing cocktails, great bartenders, good live music, awesome speakeasy-like decor and feel. ",4
 Narrow entree selections could inhibit repeat/frequent visits for dinner. This is a must visit establishment for foodie searchers. ,5
" Overall a good experience. Good food but not great. Decent service (they are really nice) but their amazing mixed cocktails take way too long to get if they are even slightly busy. I ordered their lamb special and it was yummy. My friend ordered their pot pie, one of their specialties, and it was tasty but a little dry. I do hear they have a good brunch though.  Live music was awesome and a decent bar crowd as well. Will probably go back for the bar and pass on the dinner. ",3

" Went for Dine About Town menu. Mushroom bisque and tri-tip were good enough to make me want to go back and try more, but the wine pour (glass of lovely Bourgogne, $9) was a little stingy and the Dine About Town deal wasn't much of a deal ($17.95 for soup and sandwich). Still, interested in returning for dinner and cocktails. Fantastic old-style saloon ambience, superb service. ",4
" We came in a group of six, and were very happy in one of their big booths. Great food, which was very satisfying, and wonderful drinks. If you tell the bartender what you like, they will make you something really interesting and deliciousl ",5
" Innventive menu, great cocktail list! ",4
" In a town where the ""cocktail as art"" is ubiquitous, Comstock can clearly hold its own. OUr group enjoyed some classics such as a Whiskey Sour, a Vodka Martini and a Greyhound, all of which were carefully prepared and a perfect example of the species. We also enjoyed the signature Pisco Punch and something called the Hop Toad, which was essentially a rum punch for the mature palate.  The food we chose was quite enjoyable as well, though the portions were a bit wee with respect to the corresponding prices. ",4
 Food was good but not great and the REALLY short menu can be a challenge if you don't happen to see just the right thing. Lots of potential and bar service is terrific. We'll go again. ,3
 Interesting concept... and a different kind of comfort food. Tasty pot pie and pork chops. Drinks were quite good (and strong). ,5
" The food was okay, nothing to write home about. The drinks, while very well made, were forgotten after three reminders- it took half an hour to get the first round and another half hour to get the second round. Service was spotty and unprofessional- servers wandered around with trays of drinks with no apparent knowledge of where they went. The decor is amazing, but there are better places to go in North Beach. ",1
 the bar area is the only place to be.  eating anywhere else is not pleasant.  food overall is heavy and a little below average.  drinks are ok but not worth dealing with the tourists and parking of this area. ,2
" I enjoyed the food but was a bit disappointed by the ambiance. The space has a very awkward layout and we were seated in a room behind the bar that felt far from the action. The food was good, but not special. ",3
" Went to lunch here and it was very nice (good food, fast service, friendly) but very quiet on a weekday lunchtime. I liked the booths and the decor, and the staff were friendly. It lacked a little in lunchtime ambience but is probably great in the evenings. ",3
" Very quiet time after Christmas and my dining companion and I were the only two people in the restaurant for two hours. We were freezing as the doors were kept open on one of the coldest days in San Francisco last month. Hopefully looking for other lunchers? Everything was okay, but considering many choices in San Francisco will not hurry back. ",4
" Our first drink orders, in the dining room, took more than 20 minutes to reach us! Food, however, was served more reasonably prompt and was excellent. The noise in the bar was ear-splitting and spilled over into the dining room, which generated its own high level of noise even though it was perhaps only 20% occupied. The interior decor is best described as ""mid-19th Century, frontier, dreary/gloomy."" Even in spite of our good experience with the food, I'm afraid that we'll not return ",2
 A very nice gastropub with great food.  They only serve beer and wine though.   The burger was really tasty... enjoy! ,5
 We were there during the lunch buffet so it got kind of crazy and loud. We decided to order from the menu instead and the team was still attentive and thorough. ,4
" I wish I could say this was a great experience - it was truly OKAY - no better !  Upon check in the concierge said that the Open Table system was not working - REALLY ?!? We were offered the buffet or option to order from the menu - I took the buffet and was underwhelmed - my friend had a vegetarian rice dish and appetizer - again, OKAY Doubt that I will return. By the way,  were there to celebrate my special #70 birthday - it was just OKAY :( ",2
" I have eaten here many times in fact I drive 20 miles from Petaluma but have only had lunch this is first time having dinner and I was super impressed.  We ordered tandori chicken, saffron basmati rice, raita  and lamb kebabs. The food was excellent. We also ordered a glass each of house sparkling wine, Zinfandel and Clausthauler.   Highly recommended. ",5
 Decided to try this as we like Indian food. It did not disappoint! Food was very good and will definitely go back and take some friends with us. The service was good and very friendly. ,4
" The food and service were great, but it was so very, very noisy.  It was hard to have a conversation at our table. ",4
" There are very few quiet moments when this foursome is together but we all went silent when tasting this incredible salmon. Salmon Kali Mirchi was worth the drive. It's herb encrusted, no sauce and simply stunning. The rest of the food was quite good and the people  were charming. We just kept ordering more orders of this dish which I can't ever remember happening before. We will definitely be back. ",4
" Ok, currently the ONLY Indian food in Novato, but it is still good. We were able to get a reservation on New Year's Eve. The service was informed and helpful. We have eaten here before, and will return. My only concern: many dishes have tomatoes, which I cannot eat. Would like to see more non tomato based dishes. When asked, I was told tomatoes could not be removed from servings. ",4
" I think Batika is the best Indian/Nepalese food in Marin County.  Fresh and clean ingredients and flavors, where some other Indian restaurants are a little ""same 'ol, same 'ol"", nothing really special or new and different.  We don't go anywhere else now.  I would say it's one of the few best all around restaurants in Marin, since we're generally lacking in good restaurants anyway in this county.  {: ",4
" When first I tried Batika a year ago, it was quite remarkable in that the flavors and ingredients had not been ""dumbed down"" in the mistaken belief that Americans are incapable of appreciating authentic Indian food.   Unfortunately, whether because a competing restaurant down the street failed, or because the kitchen staff has gotten bored with an unchanging menu, it has declined to the level of ""good generic"" Indian food.   I can only urge management to review this slide in quality. I am convinced that if ingredients were of higher quality, spicing (and I do not mean just heat) were sharpened and refined, and there were one or two regional or seasonal specialties offered, this could become a destination restaurant in Marin and beyond. ",3
" Truly a great indian restaurant. I was a bit concerned when I saw the cooks were not indian but they truly know what they are doing! Awesome food, I ordered the Tandori Chicken and asked for Tikka Masala sauce on the side, so yummy, we also got the palak paneer, usually at other restaurants it is so overwhelmed by onions that it isn't any good, not here, it was perfect! My only reason for not giving it 5 stars was because I was disappointed in the Nan and Roti, such small pieces of bread made it hard to wrap all the good food up together!  Enjoy! ",4
 Loved this sweet restaurant -- lovely service &amp; the food was excellent.   I'm picky about Indian food &amp; usually disappointed -- I highly recommend Batika! ,4
 Food and service is consistently good. The Indian ice cream desert is now my favorite soo yummy do not forget to try this one. ,4

" i was looking for a restaurant in the mission, that took reservations for a mid-week lunch, and i was thrilled to book this through Open Table. Paige, the waitperson, was amazing; she was warm, welcoming, flexible, professional, personable, knowledgeable, and accommodating. The food on the menu was comforting yet unique, and the chefs prepared every dish perfectly, attentive to our substitutions and preferences. The salmon was perfect, prepared rare and without the pork, and others loved the Grass-Fed Beef Burger (best burger ever), as well as the Roasted Lamb Sandwich. I ordered a butterscotch pot-de-creme to go, and my only regret is that I only ordered one, because it’s phenomenal.  We look forward to returning. thx for savory food and attentive service! ",5

" Friendly and professional, just right ",4
 Had a pretty good evening here on my 2nd visit.    Ordered the burger and the brussels sprouts.  Service was friendly and reasonably quick.   The brussels spouts unfortunately did not get served but it was not added to the bill.    I would recommend coming here earlier in the evening and opentable is always a good bet. ,3
" Have been here twice and both times the food was good, warranting the 3 stars.  Have had what seems to be the go-tos (deviled eggs, chicken wings, liver mousse, pappardelle, and a few others).  All were good, but not spectacular or anything well beyond what one would expect in SF even in this relatively modest price range (think mid-tier happy hour).  Both times, however, the place was dead during peak hours when most the neighboring restaurants were bustling.  After twice experiencing terrible service, I now understand why this place is so dead despite the good food.  Service both times fell far below mediocrity and easily into the realm of lazy and rude, resulting in terribly slow service in a dead restaurant.  Anyone reading this review and doubting it in light of the other reviews (which I truly cannot comprehend in light of my experiences), should go on open table.  I'd bet there is tons of reservation availability.  Unless you are ordering Postmates or to-go, this is definitely a pass ... unless you are hosting a guest you really don't like. ",2
 Food was amazing! Server was on point as well. Definitely coming back here over and over again! ,5
" We have eaten here three times during the last two month. Each time was as good as the first time, which was excellent. This restaurant is worth a try, for sure.   Definitely,  one of the best values in the Mission and it is on our A list for all the restaurants in the Mission. ",5
 Great food and great service! Menu was comforting and yet a different spin on the usual. ,5
" Food was extremely overpriced for what it was. I ordered a salad that said it had a lot of ingredients on the menu, but it was basically soggy lettuce.   The servers kept double serving. One minute one person would take our drink order. A minute later a new person. This continued for the entire meal and was quite annoying. Get sections! ",2
 Shockingly expensive for bland fare that sounded great on paper.  We were to desperate to find a place open after 9pm to make a more discerning choice.  May have been adequate if not for the cost.  The place across the street had an hour and a half wait.  I guess that should have been a clue. ,3
 Great selection of sharing size plates. Flavors are wonderful ,5
" There's no crowd here for brunch, but there should be. Lots of comfort food on the menu, but it's prepared with restraint so the focus is on flavor first, comfort second. In other words, they don't abuse fat, sugar, and salt to seduce your tastebuds. Try the excellent grits with kale or the challah french toast that's full flavored without being overly sweet.  Great, attentive service at brunch. ",4
 Really delicious brunch - something for everyone! Service was great and would come back ,5
 Farm toast bread and creme fraiche ice cream were DELICIOUS ,5
 Great addition to SF restaurants.  Food was excellent; small menu but all dishes listed are enticing.  Has a combination of small and large plates which can be combined.  Lamb burger was outstanding; slices of cooked lamb with Moroccan tomato jam and feta on a brioche bun-fantastic! ,5
" Tried this after watching ""Check Please Bay Area"". Door person seemed a little stress, &amp; not especially welcoming nor attentive. Service started a bit slow although the restaurant was not full. Cocktails were ok, but not spectacular.  We started with deviled eggs &amp; they were tasty. Next was the Jersey Wedge &amp; that was very good. We liked that they lightly drizzled some dressing on the lettuce, but put more on the side for individual liking. Next was the potted chicken liver mousse. This was tasty, but not better than others we've tried elsewhere. Last small plate we tried was the spiced shrimp with creamy grits. This was very good with grits that actually tasted of corn. The entire dish was very flavoful.  We chose the papparadelle with pork cheeks which was very good. It  had a deep down mushroom flavor, but could have used a bit more salt. The burger on the other hand was very beefy &amp; had a great charred flavor. We think their burger is actually slightly better than Chez Maman &amp; Monsieur Benjamin.   While everything was pretty good so far, the deserts didn't do as well. The pot de crème was nice enough, but the butter scotch flavor should have been stronger. The thyme shortbread cookie was not good. It kept reminding me my dinner fell into my desert. The tres leches-almond brown butter cake had decent flavor but was very dry.   Overall, decent food &amp; their bus persons were very attentive &amp; hard working. Our waiter tried hard also but seemed a bit overwhelmed. We'd come back if in the neighborhood, but would not make a special trip. ",4
 Food was great enjoyed sharing to try all the different options ,4
 Ross our waiter was friendly. The chicken sammies were delicious and the dessert options were great. Enjoyed the pot de Crete and Zepponi. ,5
" Pass on the olives and chicken ""sammies"". Lamb sandwich was good. ",3
" My husband and I had a lovely meal here, before taking in a show at The Marsh, conveniently around the corner. (It's also close to the Mission-Bartlett parking garage.)  The wait staff were helpful and inobtrusive.  We were there early (6 pm), and the sun was setting on a warm day, making  it a little warm at our table. The server kindly positioned a fan at the bar to blow on us.  As the sun went down over the building across the street, things quickly cooled off.  The diversity of dishes (small plates, large plates, and starters) was a  real treat for our tastebuds.  I'd definitely go back for the lamb sandwich alone. For my husband, it was the grits and shrimp.  And oh, those Zeppole. Fresh. Light but dense. Wonderful dipping sauces.  We made a great choice. Yay! ",5
 it was a warm evening in the City and we had a wonderful meal. We would return. ,4
 Tried this for my birthday lunch with a friend and was very pleased. Modern atmosphere and clean lines. The wait staff was excellent and recommended best dishes and wines. Catered to our needs but without overkill. Loved the homemade potato chips with horseradish dipping sauce. Enjoyed the chicken sammies as well as the deviled eggs for starters. We raved about the lamb sandwich and the pulled pork sandwich with a bite! Really enjoyed lingering over a delicious lunch without feeling hurried! We'll definitely be back! ,4
" Very attentive server at lunch. Food was very good, especially the deviled egg and the pappardelle. In a neighborhood with lots of great options Myriad is a solid choice. ",4
 Great food and exceptional service. ,5
" My husband and I were pleased with our first visit, when we stopped in after a movie at The New Alamo. The restaurant had a steady stream of people coming in and out at 8pm on a Saturday, but it never felt too noisy or crowded. Very attentive, but not overbearing service from Danny and the rest of the service staff. Small plates were tasty, and our hangar steak was prepared a perfect medium rare. ",5
 Good gastropub food at a reasonable price. Friendly staff and reservations aren't difficult. ,4
 We called ahead to see if a basketball game was on the tv and they were so nice and accommodating. Very friendly place. Much fun. My kids loved the drinks they had. ,5
" Saw Myriad Gastropub featured on Check Please Bay Area and it got good reviews so wanted to give it a try. Did not disappoint.  Service was good, space was nice, not too loud. We started with deviled eggs which are very popular and lived up to the hype. My burger was cooked as ordered and tasted great. Went with 2 friends who are foodies and they raved about their dishes, one was a pork cheeks with pasta.       Was perfect place to spend with friends and will definitely go again.   I only wish they had a full liquor license but do serve beer and wine. ",5
" The place is small and therefore a little loud but I went with two friends and we were able to carry on a conversation okay. Good drinks menu - the beer selection is especially good, we also liked the cocktail recommendations. Food was great. We ordered the lamb sandwich, the pappardelle and salmon. All delicious although the brussels sprouts side dish seemed to be a little too crunchy, perhaps cook it a little before serving? Portions are large enough that you won't want a dessert. Our server was down to earth and knowledgeable. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a nice, casual place to eat and drink in the Mission. ",3
" Accessible flavors, warm welcoming service, overall tasty with some standouts. Great discovery. ",4
" Staff were welcoming to three children in our party, and understanding when I called to inform them that we were going to be fifteen minutes late. ",5
 Staff are excellent The food is tasty What else do you want? ,5
" I love this restaurant! The service is friendly and attentive without being overwhelming, and the food is stunning. My friend and I totally cleaned our plates. I can't recommend it highly enough. Well worth seeking out. ",5
" We really enjoyed our dinner at Batika.  We order chicken curry, lamb vindaloo, coconut lemon shrimp with saffron rice and coconut rice, etc. Overall every dish was very tasty and cook well. But I must say the best out of the main three dishes was the coconut lemon shrimp it was made to perfection and the sauce was incredible. Every single person in our table was very pleased.  Great quantity, quality for your money. ",4
 One of the best Indian restaurants we have ever experienced. Would recommend this place to anyone. We dined outside. Whole experience was wonderful. ,5
" Consistently delicious, this is our go-to restaurant for wonderful Indian food. ",5
 Food and service was excellent . We been here a few times always consistent standard of excellence. ,5
 This was a graduation dinner for our daughter. The food was great and the waiter was very helpful in helping me select dishes that provided a nice variety of food and adequate portions for everyone in our party and the rest of the service was wonderful....  Thanks guys it was great! ,5
" We went for a family dinner outing, and the experience was very good overall. The only thing we split on was whether or not food was markedly better tasting than Lotus in San Rafael. I thought so, but the rest of the family didn't agree. ",4
" As always, we had another wonderful dinner. We always look forward to coming in. On Friday evening we sat next to a nice couple who was new to the area. They were so thrilled that they had found such a wonderful Indian restaurant. The food and service is always fantastic.  ",5
" Gosh, I love this place. Every single bite is so delicious. I should eat here once a week. I have been to India and truly love it. This saves that very long drive and flight. Take my word for it, this place is the best.   ",5
 We frequent Batika at least twice a month and we are NEVER disappointed! The food is always delicious and fresh and the service is friendly and prompt. The decor on the inside is ecclectic and fun but there is also an outdoor patio for 'al fresco' dining. Best Indian restaurant in Marin! ,5
 We love the fact we have a terrific indian restaurant in Novato that is as good as any in San Francisco. We visit there on a regular basis and always leave pleased with our choices and the quality of food. They offer a lunch buffet which is pretty decent as well for $8.95. Give it a shot. ,4
" My husband and I have brought friends with to dine at Batika Indian Bistro several times, as well as having eaten there on our own on several occasions. The variety of delectable and savory dishes available on Batika's menu are a delight to the palate. We have sampled a variety of lamb, chicken and sea food dishes as well as some of Batika's curries. We have never been disappointed with our choices. The food is absolutely delicious and the service is warm, friendly, very polite. The aromas emanating from Batika's kitchen as you enter the restaurant are heavenly. They are an olfactory indicator of the wonderful food that you will experience at this restaurant. We eagerly anticipate our next visit to Batika Indian Bistro ! ",5
" ..that was nicely marinated, moist and not overdone that one typically finds in most Indian restaurants! Achari eggplant was very good, spices were flavorful without being overwhelming. The Kashmiri Rogan Josh (lamb) would have been really good as well except the lamb cubes were not tender and seemed overcooked. The vegetable pulao was good; appreciated the vegetables not being overcooked. My preference is having the vegetables cut slightly smaller so overall dish texture be more balanced. The garlic naan was perfect! Great different pickled condiments along with their mango chutney were really good condiments that fit everything! Looking forward to sampling more on menu as they have very enticing options! ",4
" Four of us enjoyed great service and food. One of our party has a severe sesame allergy and the server was very attentive, making sure the hit hen was aware. I love the French brasserie-esque atmosphere. Everyone was delighted with their food choices, salmon, lamb and veggies. ",4
" HAD A GREAT TIME, FOOD WAS FRESH AND GREAT, BUT LOTS OF SMOKE THROUGHOUT RESTAURANT WHEN THE TOOMARI PLATES OF SIZZILING FOOD WOULD BE BROUGHT OUT TO TABLES, POOR VENTILATION. ",4
" We hate to admit it but we drove by this restaurant for years wanting to try it but hadn't. We began eating there about a month ago and love it. The food is fresh, delicious, and consistant. The staff has been very helpful as we have needed some direction while ordering. We will continue to go. It's now one of our local favorites. ",5
" A little rough neighborhood, but the food was out of this world. Drew was our server and he was fabulous.  We don't get the San Francisco often, but we're definitely going to come back. ",5
 Such a wonderful time. The food was tasty and the service was spectacular. Can't wait to go back. ,5
" We went early on a Sunday for brunch. It wasn't crowded yet, so it wasn't loud, which made me very happy. We loved the decor - comfortable but classy and fun. The food was delicious. Each dish had a little something special that made it shine without being weird or over the top. Service was warm and friendly and helpful. ",5
 From start to finish the experience of eating here was underwhelming at best   Major disappointment ,1
 Great food and friendly service! Went for casual brunch with friends and our waitress was very nice. Food was delicious (the shakshuka and pate were very popular with our group)! ,4
" We'd only experienced the lunch buffet which is decent food for a reasonable buffet price. When we scheduled a party for the evening, I was pleased to be able to do so online. Food was decent as usual, but the price was surprisingly high. I don't think I'll be scheduling dinner events here again. Still, nice staff and location. ",3
" Eating at Batika is like a trip on the Orient Express! Very authentic in terms of menu, food and waiters. Love this place so much, it's the best Indian food I've ever had! ",5
" Great meal, service, all-around pleasant experience!! ",5
" Wonderfully presented, adequate portions, affordable. ",5
 Service was very slow. Food was not that good. Artichoke and spinach dip was horrible. More than likely will not go back. Our waitress was very nice we just felt service was very slow. Food mediocre. Maybe a new chef and if it’s not the chef maybe some new recipes ,2
 We had 3 other people with us and they have never been before. They will definitely come back. They all loved their food. ,5
" I ate here because it was conveniently located and the reviews were good. I was not prepared for how outstanding it was. This is the best Indian food I have had in the Bay Area. So often it is too heavy, to greasy or overpoweringly seasoned without subtlety. I found the food to be fresh, authentic and prepared with attention to detail. The waitstaff were attentive and gracious. Small but OK wine list. Kind of a romantic little restaurant with an outdoor seating area that would be nice for lunch. I look forward to going back. ",5
" I've passed by Batika countless times but never had the opportunity to go in. I am so glad I went the other night with two other companions. We shared many dishes and every single one was delicious! My only complaints are that the tables are a little close to each other, and the noise level is fairly high. I'd really like a slightly quieter dining experience, but it was otherwise top-notch. ",5
 Food and service were great. Second time visiting cant wait till we come again. ,4
 Love this place. Love the food. Love the owner. We practically licked our plates clean! Will be back many times! ,4
" Excellent service and food at our last visit. It is a chain, so I can't give five stars for the food since it is standard in that way, but everything we ate was cooked to perfection. The restaurant has a modern but cozy look and feel, and the manager is memorably friendly and interested in making your experience shine. This is (by far) the best Black Angus in the Bay Area. A great experience all around! ",5
" The last two visits at Black Angus in Vallejo I had to request different seating both times, hosting needs to pay more attention to customers who do not want to be seated in a teeny tiny booth nor anywhere near a table of 14 okay!!  Love the food, service was great last visit and they actually gave us hot baked potatoes this time!!!  Last time before that server was inept and therefore our dinner was not as enjoyable as it could have been, aside from the fact that we were moved to a larger booth but closer to kitchen in the bar dining room so quite a lot of distraction buy hey I already moved once so dealt with it!!!   I do think that if you are a customer paying damn good money for a nice steak dinner in nice restaurant, don't go cheap on the service or seating in funky areas of the dining hall!!!!  Especially when it is not very busy!!!  It's our family's go to birthday restaurant so I'll be back for the prime rib and rib eyes and lobster of course!!  The jumbo shrimp on the menu are not JUMBO SHRIMP, they are regular shrimp but they are good!!  Nuff said.... ",3
" Disappointing !  We chose local to eat for my husband's BD-    We ordered a bottle of wine and our meals.  Nothing complicated and within guidelines of menu choices.   We waited quite awhile and our wait person returned and indicated that the kitchen was OUT of Brussels sprouts.  That was no problem.  After nearly 40 minutes, someone showed up with our hot entrees. But - we were NEVER served our salad choices.  No one offered to take back our entrees as we enjoyed our salads -instead, -our table was littered with all these food plates- all at once. A manager stopped by, and saw the disastrous meal- and mumbled something about a free dessert!  ( No thanks!)  Our steaks were both over cooked and cold by the time we got around to eating them. The same man stopped by again- my husband showed him a piece of overcooked steak.   The bill came and we were charged for only 1 entree, but got charged for the non-existent Brussel Sprouts.   We were OVER this place.  Usually, Black Angus is consistent, reliable, and offers a valued product.  NOT this time.  Waitstaff and kitchen were unacceptable. ",1
" Great location to the theater, wonderful strive and decent food! ",5
" Everything was good for the most part. We were a party of 7 (1 child), but my 7 year old son's food didn't come with everyone else's. We had to ask a second time for his meal and my sister's salad. The server did not charge us for for it. Food took a bit to get to the table and they ran out of brussel sprouts. Overall it was still good. The server was attentive and nice. ",3
" Prime Rib was awesome, service was excellent!  Would definitely recommend! ",5
 The food was great. The service was even better.  The Rib Eye was hot and juicy with lots of flavor. The bread was hot from the oven. The server was great.  She had several tables but we still got great service. ,5
" I made reservations and we were seated immediately. It took our server approximately 20 minutes to take our order. We had to ask our server  continuously for drink refills. Our salads and soups took approximately 30 minutes to be brought to us. Our entrees took another 30 minutes to come out. The restaurant was empty of patrons. Our bill was $113 dollars for four of us with a $20 off coupon. The food was delicious but the service was way less than desirable. Two hours in all for dinner, extremely slow. Very expensive compared to other steakhouses such as Texas Roadhouse. ",3
 Best service i had in days.... the food qere cooked the way we wanted. My family and I are really please with Black Angus vallejo. ,5
 Our waitress was so impatient in taking our orders. She even had a tantrums by taking one of our orders by getting it by her hand and left. This makes our evening so awkward and unpleasant.  She didn’t even apologize. I talked to her  manager about the incident and the manager was so nice and accommodating and make it right with one of our order.  I think you should train well your employees on how to handle this kind of situation. Even though she treated us poorly we still gave a good tip. She doesn’t deserved the tip but it’s not for her it’s for the whole employees who helped us.  Foods were ok not really something to come back. ,3
 I’m not sure how this place is still in business ,1
" I had the Rib eye steak that was cook to perfection,  mash potato  and salad.   I was thier on NEW YEAR'S  EVE. The service was great. ",5
 New Years Eve ,5
 The service was good but I noticed the restaurant is not being kept up from when I first visited . The booths seats are filthy need to be changed or deep cleaned. The dinner was good for the value but the steak was tasteless &amp; tuff. 🤷🏽‍♀️ ,3
 We go to Black Angus often. Never disappointed. The service was extremely fast and server was great! ,5
" The food was great. Service attentive,  just right. Good table.  6 oz. Filet with two lobster tails and two sides, baked potato and green beans with bacon pieces. ",4
 Excellent as always🥂 never dissapointed. Food is always as ordered. Kids meals are really good also. ,5
 Our Server was friendly and well meaning but did not bring the steak sauce and over charged us for one of the orders. ,2
 Great time. Great food. Good for a birthday lunch/dinner. Using Open Table was easy. It was my first time using it.  Thanks ,5
" My wife, daughter, two lady friends and I (lucky me) have a great dining experience celebrating my wife's birthday and one of the lady friend's birthday who also became a U.S. citizen the day before. So it was a big and enjoyable get-together for all of us. Three of use enjoyed steaks, one had lobster and another had the vegetarian salad (and that's no beef). Thank you Black Angus Steakhouse for a memorable  time with very friendly service. ",5
 The food choices were great and we used a discount coupon. I especially like the use of Open Table. The app is easy to use and amnend your arrival time if necessary. The restaurant was ready for us when we arrived. I highly recommend using Open Table. Linda Z in Vallejo Ca ,5
 My husband and I went there for a date night dinner. The service was excellent. The waitress was the perfect amount of attentive. The food was served hot and it was delicious. ,5
" Steak was good, was disappointed with the Sour cream and butter on Bake potato...that brand is not capable with red lobster...too creamy and like water down other than that very happy how my steak was done and I like the amount of caesar salad ",4
" We had reservations, yet the receptionist at check-in was awful! He walked us around and around, then sat us in an area that was so busy that the waitress did not say a word to us. Then we moved to another table, yet we were told that we would not get served there since there was only 1 server! That made us get up and leave.....bad service that day! ",1
" Food was good, as always. Best cheesy bread &amp; potato soup. Service was just ok. We were seated right away at our reservation time.  Chocolate chip cookie dessert was delicious! ",3
 Great food. Incredible service. We will return again for our next special occasion. ,5
 We always enjoy coming to Black Angus. Thanksgiving was every bit as good as everyday dining. ,5
" We was seated in a nice area waitress was nice, while sitting there a family next to us brought in there dog and had it in the booth alot of people was upset including my family but once our waitress saw our face expression and other guests the family was ask to leave and they did with no problem I feel they was never should have been seated at all the dog was not hidden and was being carried wasnt even a service dog...But other than that Food and drinks was good ",4
" It was my first time visiting the Vallejo location, and on thanksgiving of all days, and I wasnt disappointed to say the least. Service was quick and efficient and our waitress was on top of everything, even though my bro the was giving her a tiny bit of a hard time. Would definitely reccomend. ",5
" My husband had the Thanksgiving meal which was delicious and hearty with thick slices of turkey, gavey, mashed potatoes, yams, cranberry sauce, brocolli, salad, bread, and pumpkin pie. I had the prime rib which was cooked perfectly medium rare, tender, and well seasoned, baked potato, soup, bread, and chocolate cake. We also ordered a side of 2 lobster tails. Surprised that the entire meal came to only 83.00. Will return again and again. ",5
" I must say, for having Thanksgiving at a restaurant, this meal wasn't bad at all.  We  were given approx. a teaspoon of cranberry sauce,  for which I was bummed.  The turkey was very tender, the potatoes were good, the dressing was really good and the pumpkin pie was very flavorful. Other than minimal amount of cranberry sauce, I would have to say that our waiter (very nice young man) was extremely loud! I didn't feel like we were at a mid level restaurant, I felt like I was at a Denny's or IHop. ",3
" We came here for Thanksgiving lunch and had a great time! Turkey with all the fixings, good service - thank you, Kim! - and food was tasty. ",4
 Our food and our waiter were the best. He made us feel that he was glad that we were there and that we enjoyed everything. ,4
 The air-conditioning was out of order and it was sweltering hot in the restaurant- if we were not starving we would have left. The service was adequate although nothing special. I will definitely not be returning to Black Angus anytime soon. ,2
" We were surprised at the value and service we received at this Black Angus location. Our server exceeded our expectations. Friendly, fast and attentive. ",4
" margaritas was weak, filet minon was overcooked and very small. lobsters were dry. ",1
 we enjoyed it he food was good the service was good ,4
" We arrived 10 min early than the time we put on our reservation. The restaurant receptist still want us to wait even thought there have a plenty of table open. Overall , it's very nice services and good food. ",5
" It was a very slow night so they sat us in the bar area. I normaly dont like the bar area, but because it was slow it worked out just fine.The service was great and the food pefect. ",4
" Although I had requested a large (tall back) booth in the back, I was told none were available even though I could see one empty. The other diners at the table next to us were extremely noisy and one kept telling the others to quiet down. The food at Black Angus is is good although nothing is particularly outstanding. Overall, it was not a good experience this time, and we will probably go elsewhere with our friends. ",3
" My husband enjoyed our dinner at Black Angus. It's always been one of my favorites. We were there celebrating our 27th wedding anniversary. The food was delicious and the service was great! If it weren't for the ecconomy we would go more often. The only problem was that I asked for a window seat near the bar and for some reason they didn't get that information. But they managed to get us exactly what we wanted anyway, so it worked out just fine. Thank you for giving us a nice anniversary dinner. ",4
 The food took way too long upon ordering to serving. ,2
" We had an excellent dining experience at Black Angus. The moment we walked in, our table was ready and waiting for us. I had specifically requested a quiet table and booth and we got both of those things. The waitress was friendly and very helpful. It seemed to be a pretty busy night though, and we waited nearly 10 minutes before she showed up, so that is certainly something I would say needed improvement. However, the food was great, the ambience was great, and it was a perfect setting for our special occasion. We will most certainly come back and I really appreciated the option to reserve our table ahead of time on the internet. Thank you! ",5
" Could have been alot better, wish I would have choosen somewhere else to dine. I feel like I wasted my money. ",2
" Food was bad, they tried to overcharge us and the waitress wasn't that great. ",1
" The food was fair at best. Nothing above average with my meal, but my partner liked most of her meal. ",3
" The waitress was great, pleasant and polite. my husband and I both ordered 12oz rid eye. 1/3 of my rid eye were fat, we talked to the store manager, he said that's why you got for rid eye. I ate there all the times, and ordered the same thing every time, but I've never seen such a big piece of fat, from the edge all the way to the middle. The manager has no intention to change or compensate me in any way. I don't think he is qualified to be a store manager at all with his attitude. ",3
 The service was very fast. All the staff was great. Very good food and a great price! ,5
 Good service. Food was served hot and all items arrived in a timely manner. ,4
 no comments ,2
 Loved the fresh-baked house bread. Food was good and service was very friendly and on-time. Used a $37 coupon for 4-course meal for 2 people but coupon was good for all 4 people in our party so we basically paid almost half what we would have paid individually - great deal! ,4
 i love how our waitress was very honest. we can in with a coupon and she told us about a deal that was more affordable and will give us more food ,4
" My husband sent a note ahead of time to notify them that this was a birthday dinner and we requested a rather large booth. The seating was nice...a little close...but nice. We all ordered pretty much the same thing, so it made it easy for the waiter. Our waiter was WONDERFUL...the food was OK. Three of our Prime Rib dinners were mostly fat, unfortunatley served to them MEN in our party. Since their Prime Rib was cooked more than ours..we could not switch. If it weren't for the wonderful service of our waiter...it would not have been such a great experience...but he was very personable and kind. The birthday was not acknowledged however...even though it was noted. ",3
 As we arrived to the restraunt we were seated to a decent table. It took the server quite a while to get to us but we understood that because it was a Friday night. Our server Christine was absolutely wonderful. The kitchen is another story. They messed up our order three times and our food tasted awful no flavor what so ever except for the appetizer sampler. The table next to us didn't get there food for a half an hour so i guess the kitchen was just having issues. It was nice of the manager to come by and put one order on him but i was really looking forward to a great meal after a very long week and i didnt get that. ,1
" We had a coupon for dinner for 2 for #37.00, which includes appetizer of choice, good selection of entrees and dessert to share. The New York steak for very good, as was all the food. Service was excellent, though it may depend on who is serving you. Our waitress was one of the best, because she was very pleasant, attentive and was a step ahead in timing, but without any fanfare. ",4
" This is a terrible place to eat. Went on Saturday night for a nice dinner and evening out. Was dissapointed as soon as we got there. Lousy service and food was garbage. Manager was ""not availble"" for complaint. Will not go back and will give BAD reference to this place. ",1
" The food was very good. The restaurant had a nice ambiance, however, I felt the music was a bit loud. A little pricy...great service. ",4
 We went on the busiest day of the year and only had to wait a few minutes for our table. The restaurant was busy and the staff was friendly. ,4
 We got seated right away. Everybody was friendly and my family enjoyed their dinner. Im glad I booked with Open Table.com and we will be booking with them for future dining. ,4
" The food is always delicious there - but I'll have to say that the service we received on Valentine's Day was the best service we have ever received in any dining experience. We never had to wait for anything - or ask for anything. It was amazing - and they were very busy, as well. ",5
 The service was awesome! The food was very good. My steak was cooked just the way I like it (which doesn't usually happen).My only complaint is that they changed their Italian salad dressing. WAY to oniony &amp; my friend &amp; I both got upset stomachs from it. ,4
" our server was not nice, had an attitude and messed up our annaversary. she also did not add our 4 course meal for 2 for $39 coupon. it was still valid and we gave it to her. my husband didnt realize she charged us full until he read through the receipt. We spent over $80 just for our 4 course meal. the 4 course meal was charged as $50 then she cahrged us for 2 refills, extra bread and the dessert that was to be included in the meal. ",1
" Even though we had a reservation we had to wait about 15 minutes before being seated in a booth that just barely fit the four of us. Waitress was fairly attentive. Food was just ok, certainly not worth the cost. ",2
 Pretty good option for a traditional Thanksgiving meal.  Definitely fills you up and all items tasty. ,4
" Great service. A little noisy, hard to have a quiet conversation. ",3
" First of all, the Campfire Feast Deal is very good, and I was able to choose some exciting choices for the combination of the deal.  I ended up sharing the Campfire Feast for Two deal with my wife, and we both had Caesar salad, salmon, and mashed potatoes. The choices were very appetizing, seeing how mashed potatoes are a very classic side to any steakhouse dish.   The service my wife and I had was very good, and our server was kind and humorous. I applaud him on his ability to keep his customers satisfied.   Although my meal and the server were pleasing, I was also dining with other family members to celebrate a birthday, and one of their meals did not arrive until we were finished eating.  Overall, the ambience, food choices, and service all make an 8 out of 10 rating. ",4
 We dined for my son's and his girlfriend's birthday Saturday the 4th of November 2017.My wife's Prime Rib was way to thin compared to the last time we went and we also had to send it back because it was raw. It came back well done not a good dinner for my wife. Also I mentioned in the Open Table comments that is was a Birthday Dinner and was not acknowledged from  the restaurant staff. ,3
" My husband and I each enjoyed the Trio Special (steak, lobster, and fried shrimp with 2 Classic Sides). Plus, I took home a large slice of chocolate cake. Yum! ",5
 1st time there and loved it! Steak was a little under cooked but I could've asked to correct it but I didn't. Service was great! Coupon for 2 for $44 was an excellent deal! Will be back soon! ,4
" Our server was Ricky and she was absolutely great!  Friendly and welcoming!  Food was consistent from previous visits. Good food, good value ",4
" Simple, ordinary local chain restaurant. The food is usually predictable quality. Nothing amazing, but cooked well, tasty and to order. Wait staff is courteous, and attentive, but often overtaxed. ",3
" I think the quality of the food has slipped over the years. Still a real bargain, especially the 4 courses for $25. ",2
" The service was kind of slow, but the food was excellent. ",3
 the quality of meat has gone down substantially since the bankruptcy filing......... still good but not nearly as good as it was ,4
 Great place for a date with my wife and without kids! ,5
" Our experience was great. Although, it was not busy at the time, the service was fast and our waitress was very tentative and courteous. The food was also great. My husband and I were completely satisfied with their selection of drinks and food. ",4
" Entrees were delicious, although the chef(s) could reduce the salt component -- a little too salty for my taste, as with two other members in my party who commented that the food was a bit on the salty side. Otherwise, restaurant is welcoming and clean. Staff was friendly and warm. Our server, Kristine wast excellent. ",5
" It made the whole evening easy to be able to reserve online, even though it was a Wednesday night and not as busy as on the weekend, it worked out very well. Great experience! ",5
 Excellent lunch with four of my work colleagues to celebrate a birthday.  The service was great and not overbearing.  Our food was very good with very few options that weren't deep fried.  We all enjoyed what we ordered and the outdoor ambiance.  I'd definitely recommend this to friends and to business colleagues who want a quiet place to talk. ,5
 Gasto pub food so made to pair with heavy alcohol drinking . The food was heavy not refined really not what I excepted in wine country . Would not recommend if you are looking for a great culinary experience . ,3
 The mushroom soup was outstanding as usual. The staff was friendly and attentive. The crispy pigs ears were wonderfully tasty ,4
 last half crab dish for the afternoon was quite upsetting to my stomach :-) ,3
 Yummy choices and great service with knowledgeable friendly waiter. Will b back. ,5
 Was even better than the great things I've heard about it.  Easily jumped to my number 2 spot of places to go and hideout and enjoy a great time! ,5
" Food took a while to come out for lunch. Other than that, great food and atmosphere ",4
" Great place all around. So appreciate the “Happy Birthday” menus. Made the day even more special. Great service, great food, one of your favorites!! ",5
 We read about the restaurant in the AAA magazine. We knew where it was but had always walked by and decided to try it out. It happened to be restaurant week and almost all of the menu was on “special”.  We went with the waiter’s wine suggestion and were not disappointed. We almost passed up  dessert but had the butterscotch maple pudding. WOW! No espresso but nice pot of pressed coffee. Restaurant has “clubby” vibe. Outdoor seating on warmer days. Cozy bar downstairs. Service and food are five star! Definitely going back! ,5
" We were very pleased with out first visit,  for Napa restaurant Week 2018. Impeccable service and presentation. Great selection of menu items - hard to decide. I had the suggested wine pairing with my dinner and it was a fun selection from Heitz Cellars. We'll be going back more often now that we are familiar. ",5
" Do not miss the mushroom soup! Perfect for winter, the rich and creamy mushroom soup is sensational on a cold day. The recipe is the legacy of previous chef Todd Humphries, known for his fondness for fungi. Pair the soup with a killer burger of cheese steak sandwich, and you've got the perfect lunch. ",4
 Enjoyed lunch here on a rainy day.  Butter lettuce salad was bland but the Fried Chicken and Steak sandwich were good. ,3
 Great food and service. Very accommodating to dietary needs. ,5
 Great dinner to end our weekend in Napa.  We ordered mainly off the bar menu and starters all of which were excellent.  Service was really good after a slightly slow and disorganized start.  Loved the restaurant but would sit in the downstairs bar (first come/first seated) next time. ,4
" Understaffed. Waited 15 minutes after seating before a server approached. Food came out slowly. Server was good, but not much she could do. Food very solid. ",4
" Rarely I find myself writing a review raving about a restaurant... Which Is sad.  In this case I'll have to give five stars. Farm to table executed well. More the well, excellent. So good that I had to have the fois grass appetizer twice! So good, that I muchedumbre through my son's french fries!!!!! and stole from my wife's plate. So good, I felt ... healty, happy, smiling after we left. Perhaps, because they do everything right there, right there. I can't wait for the summer to sit outside have a stunning meal while watching the Coi in the pond. Our waitress was a real treat, treating us like friends would treat one at their home. ",5
" This is our second time to Goose and Gander.  We sat in the basement bar. Jay is hands down, the best server we have ever had.  He brought out the chef that makes all of their cured meats in-house.  Jay had a great personality, made spot on wine recommendations, and knows the menu and area well.   The mushroom soup is decadent.  The charcuterie platter was excellent. ",5
" Excellent food, friendly and attentive staff, wonderful wines. ",4
" I always have a great time when I come here. The staff is very helpful, friendly, and accommodating. The food is delicious every time! Love it and will continue to recommend Goose &amp; Gander to friends heading to the area. ",5
" Enjoyed lovely meal, service and conversation at one of the best places in St Helena. Will be back on next trip. Food excellent as always and waitress was a lot of fun. ",5
" Went for my ladies Birthday this last weekend and they nailed everything. I tipped the restaurant off with notating that we were coming for a Birthday celebration. As we got to our seats the host laid the menus down and printed across the top was her name. Our waiter Jason was awesome! First off he greeted us and wished my lady a Happy Birthday then asked if we have been to the restaurant before which we hadn't so he broke down the menu to make selecting what we wanted quick and easy, he was also very attentive and we never felt like we were waiting. We both ordered the New York Steak which was seasoned perfectly and cooked just right. We were both filled after the meal, but what's celebrating a birthday without desert?! The desert that stood out the most from the menu was the Take Five Candy Bar (I will be going back occasionally just to get this to fulfill my sweet cravings!) which was the best way to end the dining experience.  Bottom line the service was awesome, food was amazing and I appreciate that they went above and beyond for us to make this experience nothing less than perfect.  Thank you all and big thanks to our server Jason! ",5
 Best birthday menu ever.  Had a great time.  The staff accommodated our requests.  Food was perfectly prepared.  I can’t stop thinking of my birthday celebration. ,5
" Great service.  They printed up a special birthday menu for our table (it was my mother's b-day).  Fun food choices, like the ""Vietnamese Pig Ears"" (tasted like bacon).  Deep Fried Olives with Pistachios were amazing!  Cocktails were elegant and creative.  Will return soon. ",5
 We visit this area once a year and try to eat at Goose &amp; Gander at least twice! Love the downstairs atmosphere and the staff is super knowledgeable about all the food and drinks. The bone marrow burger with duck fat fries is amazing! I have dreams about that burger because it is so good. We also tried the Sunday supper prime rib special this time and it was great. This is a must visit restaurant! It’s an all time favorite of ours! ,5
 We came here for my wife’s birthday.  The server did a great job making this a special occassion with little things like customizing the menu to say Happy Birthday. The food was amazing and was an overall wonderful experience.  Will defiantly come back and recommend it to anyone! ,5
 Fabulous!  I had one small issue and the server corrected it immediately without a problem.  The food was extraordinary and the wine list is extensive.  Can bring a bottle if you wish.  The corkage is $20.  Will return soon! ,5
" What a cool English hunting lodge minus  the stuffed game. It’s cozy, unstuffy and downright friendly. The “Coolest Bar in the World” downstairs . The staff were so knowledgeable, had a great grasp of their menu as well as the and Great cocktails. Hell, it’s the “Martini House”. So glad they kept the Martini House Mushroom Soup. Outstanding! ",5
" Went for lunch based on open table review.  Two ladies for a midweek lunch.  Love it all!  Awsome ambience next to fireplace.  Wanna go back during warm weather to sit for drinks in downstairs bar or outside patio.   Food met expectations for napa valley lunch; Mushroom soup was delish, a loved fried chicken Sandwich.  Plan to go back with large group to sit in private dining room! ",5
" The food was delicious but the service left a bit to be desired.  Our table of 5 ordered 4 appetizer for one couple to share as dinner, and 2 main course, and one person not eating due to illness ; now, as a restaurant manager I understand that the server may have been disappointed, but her abrupt change in attitude from pleasant to overtly rude was unacceptable.  While the meal was delicious and her attitude softened a bit by the end of service, it definitely put a large damper on the overall experience. ",5
" Amazing food, service and ambiance! ",5
 Everything is delicious but bit heavy! Go hungry. ,4
 It was absolutely wonderful to find the rare bourbon Pappy Van Winkle. What a treat that was. ,5
" Really appreciated the cocktails in the downstairs bar. Well executed and tasty. We ordered food and were a little less thrilled. Some of the dishes were good, but others were just off. Either were really bland, weren’t hot or some other thing that just made the dishes miss. Mushroom soup was fantastic though. ",3
 Bar downstairs is great very speakeasy esque. Bartenders are extremely talented ,5
 Got the burger with bone marrow and it was good! A little messy. Also got the chicken wings wet which had great flavor but too spicy for some. Corn croquettes were OK. Old fashioned was great. Server was great. Ambiance like a lodge. ,4
 Food and service were excellent. I was a little disappointed that a $19 burger came with a soggy bottom bun. ,4
 Ben was thoughtful and amazing ,5
 Vince in the bar was great.  Cocktails are very creative and food is great and reasonably sized portions ,5
" We went for dinner to celebrate our anniversary and received complimentary champagne as soon as we sat down.  For appetizers, we ordered fried olives/crispy pistachios and grilled Spanish octopus. Both were excellent.  For the main entree, we ordered the prime rib and pork chop. The pork chop was so tender, juicy and very flavorful.  Prime rib was very good but had too much fat in it. We ordered the Basque cake for dessert which was awesome! I would highly recommend this dessert. Great dining experience overall. ",5
" Thoroughly enjoyed our dinner at Goose and Gander.  The waiter was excellent as was the food and atmosphere and of course, the cocktails.  Highly recommend the mushroom soup and the Basque cake for dessert! ",5
" Too limited menu.  Menu options we chose tasted ""Fatty"".  Not much flavor.  Bartenders great as was service. ",1
 Great food.  Terrific staff that can actually carry on a conversation with customers without being intrusive.  Can’t recommend highly enough. P.S. the cheeseburger is off the charts good. ,5
" Once again, thank you for restoring my faith in food. Always worth the drive from Reno and the main reason for it. ",5
" Original Food, deliciously prepared.  Creative bar menu. An all-around winner.  Monthly specials. Restaurant Week participant. Able to bring Napa Valley wines with no corkage. Can't wait until the outdoor dining opens up in another month or two. Will push it over the top. ",5
" Went for Restaurant Week, but after we got there and asked for the Restaurant Week menu we were told it was sold out. Would have gone somewhere else instead if we knew they could sell out of the option. ",1
" One of the best meals I've had in a while. Everything from the food to the service to the setting was phenomenal. Highly recommend, and well-worth the drive from San Francisco. ",5
 Very good experience. The food was good though the menu perhaps a little limited (lunch). Service was excellent and the atmosphere ideal for a lunch.  Would recommend the Charter Oak. ,5
" Outstanding food and service. We had the Restaurant Week lunch in addition to a scrumptious mozzarella and Brussels sprout app and a chocolate molasses dessert torte. The lunch itself included a gorgeous fresh, dark green salad, roasted lamb shoulder and grilled bread. The surprise was that the lamb was served sliced and swimming in yummy juices, along with middle eastern sides such as baba ghanoush, yogurt, picked cauliflower, etc. Delicious and unexpected! Great service. Wonderful cocktails. The only downside is the interior design which isn’t quite ‘there’ yet. We’ll be back! ",4
" Restaurant week, here's the deal. Many restaurants participate by having a 2 course lunch for $20 per person or dinner at $35-45pp. It is usually a set menu, some restaurants change the menu every day, and others serve the same all week. MAKE RESERVATIONS.   Charter Oak , St. Helena,  Napa,  has been open 7 months. The staff are friendly, informative and excited about their jobs. The food is outstanding. We had a 'simple"" salad of local farm fresh greens and herbs with a dressing that was at once a delicious olive oil based vinaigrette but not too acidic.  It was followed with a braised lamb shoulder in its own jus but also with brick oven roasted pita  bread and 4 accompaniments- an eggplant baba ganoush puree- the smoothest most delicious spread, a mayo based caper  sauce, a baby cauliflower spicy vege salsa, butternut squash puree with a green pesto center. The ""condiments"" accompaniments made a PERFECT sandwich. They paired a red IPA beer with it for an extra charge of $5; It was a 22 oz bottle! I do not like IPA so I tried a stout also from a Santa Rosa brewery. It was perfect for my taste.  Our server Sam, described them perfectly, so I could make a great choice. We didn't have room for dessert, but we will go back for a bar snack of it, late afternoon someday. Dessert is a production all in itself with a mini Pavlova, a dense choc torte and buffalo ice cream.  Do not miss this new Gem in St. Helena, Napa Valley. We even had the good fortune of meeting Christopher the chef /owner on our way out. As far as ambiance goes, I like the new decor, dark walls, and tall windows showcasing the large bar. The tables &amp; chairs are comfortable with a cute little drawer for your own silverware &amp; napkins. Despite being almost full, to our delight we could talk easily and not compete with nearby tables. This really was exceptionally special. ",5
 Shared the  rib with roasted beets and the broccoli salad. Wow! DELICIOUS! And the bread. And dessert. Will definitely be back! Very nice staff. Cool vibe and decor too. ,5
" We came for Restaurant Week. When we told our waitress, she said we had to make reservations specifically for that menu ahead of time and there were not enough lunches to accommodate us. There was no mention of this on your website plus this is NOT how Restaurant Week works! It was disappointing to say the least. We did order off the regular menu and our meal was okay, but not great. Our waitress felt badly and did a great job of describing the menu choices plus service. For a new restaurant that we thought we’d really enjoy, we were definitely taken back about this situation. ",3
" Arrived at Charter Oak on Tuesday at 12:30 for restaurant week Napa Valley.  Made booking through the promotional webpage on Open Table for Restaurant Week.  It said ""Lunch - $20"" so when the 2 of us arrived we were seated and then asked what we would like to order...I said ""$20 restaurant week lunch please for the 2 of us""  We were then told that they were no longer offering that lunch and would we like to order something else?  Of course we walked out and said classic ""Bait &amp; Switch"" unethical marketing.  As a Napa local I will go out of my way to tell people never to go to Charter Oak! ",1
 Awesome. Great wine list and great food. ,5
 Restaurant week.  Minimal choice for food. Only lamb. Chicken salad missing chicken when we order weed off the regulars menu.  Salad was overdressed and consisted of greens and mouthful of sugary raisins.  Felt sick after that ,2
" AN EASY PLACE TO EAT! We were made comfortable from the second we crossed the threshold. A casual atmosphere with a hint of family dining is what you see, until the food arrives, then everything changes!  The attention to every detail in every item of food they serve is exquisit. The experience starts with 39 day cultured butter and house baked sour dough bread made from a 40 yr old culture. Let me warn you... the serving sizes are large and they bring empty plates that encourages you to share dishes and double your pleasures. I suggest you make a party of 4-6 and only order 3-4 items for each course; the portions are large and it allows you to enjoy several choices.  On this 4 dinner trip we ate at the very best Napa has to offer from Michelin Star restaurants to the Finest in French Dining and our evening at the Charter Oak was #1. The farm to table approach, with the incredible attention to every dish, sauce, vinegarette, Buffalo Milk cheese and ice cream makes this a truly original and exquisit restaurant.  We are returning in a couple of weeks and his time with 2 more couples. Bill ",5
" A Birthday dinner. Attentive service, very friendly/helpful. Food was great, wonderful flavors and textures. I love the vibe, rustic-elegant with a bit of playfulness. Thank you. ",4
" Extremely professional staff, inviting ambiance, and clean, precisely cooked food. ",4
" Outstanding food! “Small” portions are bigger than they give themselves credit for, but everything is delicious and worth trying - especially the mozzarella and Brussels. ",5
" I enjoyed Charter Oak very much! They really made farm to table come alive! Friendly, attentive staff and a beautiful dining room made it a comfortable experience. I appreciate service charges being added to the bill, but 20% is a bit preemptive. I think it should be an automatic 15-18% and then guests can add more if they wish. The 20% service especially got on my nerves when I had a separate glass of wine at the bar. Due to the cost of my wine, I was charged $4 service just for the bartender pouring my wine in a glass and handing it to me. That was ridiculous. ",4
 Great experience and food great service. We will be back for birthdays in March 2 months from now! ,5
" Amazing food, service and ambience!  Can’t wait to go back! ",5
" Everything from the service to the food, and the ambiance was excellent. Although it was cold outside, we sat on the patio and had a couple of heaters next to us which made it enjoyable. They even allow you to bring local NAPA wines for no corkage fee (max 2). I would definitely come back here again. We shared a bunch of entrees and they were all good. ",5
" Charter Oak is another ""Go-To"" restaurant in the Napa Valley for us - we've been numerous times now.  No wine for us tonight, as we decided to try the Flask (for 2) of the Black Apple Manhattan with Mitchers American whiskey, Contratto sweet Vermouth, black apple, American oak ($28)  Yes, they bring a flask to the table. This batch was made in-house and was one of the best Manhattans we've ever had !!!  Tonight we shared the . . . Durum wheat spaghetti. clams. wilted pea leaves. chile condiment ($21) = beyond amazing  For entrees we consumed the . . . Beef rib grilled over cabernet barrels. beets dried over the fire ( $26) = this is CRAZY good . . . and the . . .  Roasted pork shoulder. spiced molasses. winter squash ($26) = Unreal.  The Dessert Cart = just you wait ! ! !  HELPFUL NOTES: * NO corkage on the first two bottles of Napa Valley wines (Napa only) - yes 2 = not a typo ! * Yes, they automatically charge 20% gratuity. * The service (by all) is amazing - hence the line above. From the front of the house; to all the servers; to the sommelier; etc. A true first class act. * Yes, there is a charge for bread ($4 &amp; $8); it's made in house; is fantastic; and if you have a problem paying for fantastic bread, don't order it - save room, weight and $ :-) * Sparkling filtered water at no charge (vs. an $8.00+/- Pellegrino elsewhere). * All your utensils are located in your own pull-out drawer under the table (like an upper desk drawer). Need another fork or knife? . . . or, choose to use a spoon . . . just open your drawer !!! * Large dedicated parking lot = NO driving around the block numerous times, while your party (already inside) is calling/texting asking if you're alright - LOL !!! ",5
" We enjoyed a wonderful lunch at Charter Oak.  The restaurant continues to wow us and our friends.  The trout salad, which is generally an off menu item, was offered as a special today: it is sublime with beautifully prepared trout, lettuce from the restaurants garden, and a distinctly Vietnamese tasting dressing.  The cheeseburger is a must-aged meat with so much flavor as to defy description.  This place is a must for anyone interested in quality food. ",5
" Second time in three weeks there and even better. Robin; server as attentive and professional as you'd want in  service.  There when you need; respects privacy; pleasant, knowledgeable.  Food is outstanding. Every detail is not missed, from bread service to iced tea(with simple syrup; ideal)  Everyone there is pleasant and warm. ",5
 Christopher Kostow's food is great and Charter Oak is a perfect venue for his talent. His subtle genius often leads people to miss elements of his cooking that are incredibly creative. ,5
" Amazing service is what really made this dining experience so much fun. Food was delicious, simple and pure. The waitstaff was incredibly well trained and knowledgeable about all aspects of restaurant . Loved our waiter Remy Swim? And effrontery.  Cocktail list fun and different...pastry chef was working the flower explains deserts . Really can’t wait to go back next time we are in Napa, and I hope they realize what a great employee  Remy is ! Also manager very kind ",5
" Food was missable and v v heavily salted. Mentioned it to the server who just shrugged and said the chef prefers that.  I am not a salt nut- i like it and use it but given the raves and the plethora of options, this was a wasted meal ",3
" I enjoyed this restaurant so much that I dined there twice in one week. It is one of the few restaurants where sharing items for the table actually works, and works well. A lot of vegetarian options. I enjoyed lunch and then came back for brunch. The apple pancake is indescribable.  A fabulous restaurant with wonderful staff. I will be returning often. ",5
" Charter Oak is magnificent! Set in a large, stately room decorated in wood and earth tones, this restaurant offers a creative menu which features tastes from many parts of the world. We were infinitely satisfied and will definitely return soon! ",5
 Modern dining with a cool rustic but hip atmosphere. ,5
 Best cheeseburger in the Valley! ,5
 Excellent food and service. We would highly recommend. ,5
 Fantastic food. Excellent Service. Smaller portions for the $$$. My best meal in Napa. ,5
" Charter Oak has a wonderful warm feeling in no small part due to the open hearth at one end of the main room. The warmth find its way into the staff and the food. Chef Kostow's influence was especially apparent in a brown butter, seaweed, and potato dish that was a flavor revelation. We also especially enjoyed the bread and house cultured butter and beets which accompanied the beef ribs. The beets were roasted in a low oven until they were the texture of meat and tasted of smoke, rosemary and beef drippings. We definitely enjoyed our meal. ",4
 Food was delicious!  Service was engaging. Restaurant decor was a bit minimalist and cold. Menu was a bit limited but food was first rate. Kudos to the chef! ,3
 This was our first time at Charter Oak.  The restaurant is roomy and the noise level is pleasant. There were small children at lunch and our conversation was not impeded at all.   The outside seating looked pleasant but it was cool so we sat inside.   The smoked salmon salad and burger were excellent. The food is offered at a range of prices which was nice to see. ,5
 Amazing experience. Went above my expectations in food and service. Will absolutely be back. ,5
" This is a fantastic place that will grow in notoriety. There is so much to choose from on the menu that it seems crazy to choose the cheeseburger, but it is the greatest burger I have ever eaten. The bread that they bake themselves is amazing and so much of what they serve comes out of their own garden. This is my favorite restaurant. ",5
" Wanted to love this restaurant we had heard so much about it. If you happen to go in the winter bring a few layers of warmth for starters.  The portion size was large however the server was suggesting that we order 3 small plates, 2 salads and 2 entrees for a party of 2.  I'm glad we ordered what we did, one salad and two entrees.  The salad and the bread were the best part of the meal, the salad being one of the best ever and the exact opposite for the entrees.  Not exactly how we wanted to spend NYE. ",2
 Had a lovely birthday dinner for a close girlfriend  - five of us enjoyed a space that allowed us to chat without feeling rushed. Food was all good and service was perfect.. ,5
" Great place...... In the area on business visiting wineries ........ and Amici recommended you. They were right on target, was nice, quiet, very attentive staff. Food was phenomenal  Duck was superb.  It was 8 pm So we didn't get to do HH, but if in the area again will sure try to get there earlier ",5
" Food quality to price ratio is incorrect. The food does not have any essence, it is not Creole nor French, nor special.  Also, the staff can be more welcoming and knowledgeable about what's being offered. ",1
" I had great expectations for this restaurant and was excited to try for the first time. I ordered the Shrimp Etouffee and I was disappointed. The roux tasted burnt and the consistency was very thick &amp; I didn't like the taste. I'm fairly easy to please with food but this was just OK. I spend a lot of time in New Orleans and the dining there is the highlight. I really wanted to like this food but it was nowhere near as good as many etouffee's I've had before. Our server, Ashley was exceptional, the ambiance was great and I would go back but I would not order any New Orleans style dishes here. ",4
" Delicious, fast and friendly! ",5
" We were in town visiting and it was close to the hotel so we figured ‘why not try it out’? The atmosphere was quite comfortable and there was romantic and soothing lighting. The menu had many interesting options and plenty vegetarian appetizers (I’m vegetarian). But they only had one vegetarian main course which was a bit disappointing but I of course ordered it and it was so good! It was well balanced. I also shared the whipped potatoes, Brussel sprouts, and cheese plate with the rest of my group and all dishes were spot on perfect! I recommend the cheese plate, it was divine and had a great selection of cheeses! Overall I 11/10 recommend this restaurant. It’s the best French food in Marin!! ",5
" Good quality food but very pricey for what it was. I would prefer to have stayed at Sams Social Club as the food is excellent there and  although on the higher scale as well the  portions, variety and value is better and the drinks are top notch ",3
" Our waitress was amazing! Not only was the food great, but she truly made our wonderful experience! Thanks for a beautiful night ",5
 The food was good.  Tables are crammed together and a bit claustrophobic. ,4
 Went to Evangeline for a birthday celebration.  The waiter was extremely attentive and great with recommendations.  We got the burger and steak.  Both were amazing.  For appetizers we had the fried pickles and crab dip.  The space was cozy and warm even though we were on the patio.  Would love to go back! ,5
 Eventhough my boyfriend asked for his steak to be cooked medium rare...it came out medium which was a bit disappointing.  Ambience was nice and the staff was great. ,3
" We eat out a lot.  Your menu was delightful, The food on the menu was even better. Deserts ro die for...Lemon Cake was so yummy... Will be back. ",5
 12/2/17 Birthday ,5
 Not bad place in Calistoga ,4
 Good. I don’t want to lengthen your review. ,4
" We have been to this establishment twice now, and have loved it both times. Impeccable service, great ambiance, and excellent food are hallmarks of the fantastic experiences we have had. We will definitely return. ",5
" The starter was very good---small potato cakes with creme fraiche, smoked salmon and cavier. The hamburger was disappointing. Not very exciting and the bun was way too wimpy and got mushy from the meat. Cheddar on top of burger had no favour so might as well not have been there. And how about onion or other more interesting ways to top up a burger? None to be had.  Hefty price for simple food that was not very tasty. ",2
 Short and sweet...everything was perfect!  Can't wait to go back. ,5
" Great service, great food. Sat outside on brick patio. Manager gave us excellent wine pairing advice, kitchen able to accommodate gluten free needs.  Perfect way to celebrate 22nd anniversary with my wife. Already recommended to our friends. ",5
" Everything about our experience was five-star. It was the best service we've had at ANY restaurant in years; the food was delicious and imaginative, and the portions generous!  We loved the ambiance and setting, and most of all the prices were VERY reasonably, especially given its location in a tourist hotspot. ",5
" we really enjoyed our meal, an attentive waiter and excellent food the patio was just right for us if we lived in Napa this would be one of our favorites, thank you Byron and lis ",4
 Nice meal and cool ambience. Outside area is where you want to be seated. ,4
 Wine country and Louisiana cuisine meet in a laid back setting. ,4
" Pretty outdoor setting, adequate quality of cuisine, but overpriced wines, oilcloth on tables, no bread or butter, undisciplined service. We wouldn't return or recommend it to anyone. ",2
" The food was delicious!  We had the chicken - the skin was thin and crispy, chicken was moist and flavorful, and the mushroom sauce was amazing!  We also had the shrimp etouffee, which was fantastic.  This restaurant is always amazing. ",5
 Our service was perfectly executed. Just perfect and not too much. Our meals were fabulous.  You must dine here! ,5
" Very welcoming, great service; very interesting menu of well-prepared and presented food. ",4
" A fabulous destination for foodies visiting Calistoga. Loved the food, ambiance, and great service. ",5
" Solid food and Great Service.   We have been to Evangeline many times and the food is consistently high quality and solid.  Dining alfresco on their beautiful patio is special  They have a nice wine list, with a good selection of California and French wines.  The service is very good - this dinner we were given extra good service by the Manager, Christian. ",4
" Steak knifes could be sharper. Food was nice and decent value for the area.  Generally quiet, but can be noisy during race nights.  Would generally recommend. ",4
" The unique outdoor garden setting with the delicious dishes made it the perfect end to a Napa Valley day.   Our favorite was a side dish - smoked padron peppers. We couldn't get enough of this tasty treat. The  cold corn chowder, shrimp etoufee and flank steak were also awesome. ",5
 This Friday was our first time there and we had a fantastic time.  We had 7:15 reservations.  We showed up early and they gave us a table right away.  Drinks showed up as soon as we ordered them.  Every dish we saw come out of the kitchen looked great.  Our waiter Edgar walked us through the specials.  Our meals came out hot and were delicious.  What was great about the service was we met at least four of the staff who came by to pick up plates or check water or how was  our dinner.  Don't miss this place if you are in Calistoga.  We never will again. ,5
" Enjoyed our meal, good cocktails,  nice patio.  A bit pricey but expected in this area.  Try it if you like Cajun. ",5
 Slightly disappointing.  The best appetizer -  a tower of seafood for $95  - was too much to order for even two people but they refused our suggestion to let us do a half order and pay a slight premium for it. -  even tho it was my dates bday.   Better places around with more willingness to accommodate. Wine list light. ,3
 Truly exceptional in every way ,5
 I cannot believe this place has so many great reviews. The food was subpar &amp; the service was horrible. The waiter disappeared without checking on us a few times &amp; the restaurant wasn't even busy. The food was not even in the ok category. There's many better restaurants in calistoga. Will not be back ,2
" We absolutely loved the food and atmosphere.  We stayed in Calistoga on our honeymoon.  We sat on the patio and enjoyed the breeze.  Service was great, very attentive.  Food came out hot and flavorful. ",5
 Our meals were delicious   Very creative   The peach and prosciutto salad was amazing.  The steak frites was perfectly cooked steak with delicious fries. ,5
 Excellent food and service!! It was simple to hot to sit outside (109 high) and slightly warm inside but I'd highly recommend this restaurant. ,5
" Loved Evangeline. A wonderful, fresh, different menu. Great service. Highly recommend. Will definitely return when we are in Calistoga. ",4
 Excellent lunch with four of my work colleagues to celebrate a birthday.  The service was great and not overbearing.  Our food was very good with very few options that weren't deep fried.  We all enjoyed what we ordered and the outdoor ambiance.  I'd definitely recommend this to friends and to business colleagues who want a quiet place to talk. ,5
 Gasto pub food so made to pair with heavy alcohol drinking . The food was heavy not refined really not what I excepted in wine country . Would not recommend if you are looking for a great culinary experience . ,3
 The mushroom soup was outstanding as usual. The staff was friendly and attentive. The crispy pigs ears were wonderfully tasty ,4
 last half crab dish for the afternoon was quite upsetting to my stomach :-) ,3
 Yummy choices and great service with knowledgeable friendly waiter. Will b back. ,5
 Was even better than the great things I've heard about it.  Easily jumped to my number 2 spot of places to go and hideout and enjoy a great time! ,5
" Food took a while to come out for lunch. Other than that, great food and atmosphere ",4
" Great place all around. So appreciate the “Happy Birthday” menus. Made the day even more special. Great service, great food, one of your favorites!! ",5
 We read about the restaurant in the AAA magazine. We knew where it was but had always walked by and decided to try it out. It happened to be restaurant week and almost all of the menu was on “special”.  We went with the waiter’s wine suggestion and were not disappointed. We almost passed up  dessert but had the butterscotch maple pudding. WOW! No espresso but nice pot of pressed coffee. Restaurant has “clubby” vibe. Outdoor seating on warmer days. Cozy bar downstairs. Service and food are five star! Definitely going back! ,5
" We were very pleased with out first visit,  for Napa restaurant Week 2018. Impeccable service and presentation. Great selection of menu items - hard to decide. I had the suggested wine pairing with my dinner and it was a fun selection from Heitz Cellars. We'll be going back more often now that we are familiar. ",5
" Do not miss the mushroom soup! Perfect for winter, the rich and creamy mushroom soup is sensational on a cold day. The recipe is the legacy of previous chef Todd Humphries, known for his fondness for fungi. Pair the soup with a killer burger of cheese steak sandwich, and you've got the perfect lunch. ",4
 Enjoyed lunch here on a rainy day.  Butter lettuce salad was bland but the Fried Chicken and Steak sandwich were good. ,3
 Great food and service. Very accommodating to dietary needs. ,5
 Great dinner to end our weekend in Napa.  We ordered mainly off the bar menu and starters all of which were excellent.  Service was really good after a slightly slow and disorganized start.  Loved the restaurant but would sit in the downstairs bar (first come/first seated) next time. ,4
" Understaffed. Waited 15 minutes after seating before a server approached. Food came out slowly. Server was good, but not much she could do. Food very solid. ",4
" Rarely I find myself writing a review raving about a restaurant... Which Is sad.  In this case I'll have to give five stars. Farm to table executed well. More the well, excellent. So good that I had to have the fois grass appetizer twice! So good, that I muchedumbre through my son's french fries!!!!! and stole from my wife's plate. So good, I felt ... healty, happy, smiling after we left. Perhaps, because they do everything right there, right there. I can't wait for the summer to sit outside have a stunning meal while watching the Coi in the pond. Our waitress was a real treat, treating us like friends would treat one at their home. ",5
" This is our second time to Goose and Gander.  We sat in the basement bar. Jay is hands down, the best server we have ever had.  He brought out the chef that makes all of their cured meats in-house.  Jay had a great personality, made spot on wine recommendations, and knows the menu and area well.   The mushroom soup is decadent.  The charcuterie platter was excellent. ",5
" Excellent food, friendly and attentive staff, wonderful wines. ",4
" I always have a great time when I come here. The staff is very helpful, friendly, and accommodating. The food is delicious every time! Love it and will continue to recommend Goose &amp; Gander to friends heading to the area. ",5
" Enjoyed lovely meal, service and conversation at one of the best places in St Helena. Will be back on next trip. Food excellent as always and waitress was a lot of fun. ",5
" Went for my ladies Birthday this last weekend and they nailed everything. I tipped the restaurant off with notating that we were coming for a Birthday celebration. As we got to our seats the host laid the menus down and printed across the top was her name. Our waiter Jason was awesome! First off he greeted us and wished my lady a Happy Birthday then asked if we have been to the restaurant before which we hadn't so he broke down the menu to make selecting what we wanted quick and easy, he was also very attentive and we never felt like we were waiting. We both ordered the New York Steak which was seasoned perfectly and cooked just right. We were both filled after the meal, but what's celebrating a birthday without desert?! The desert that stood out the most from the menu was the Take Five Candy Bar (I will be going back occasionally just to get this to fulfill my sweet cravings!) which was the best way to end the dining experience.  Bottom line the service was awesome, food was amazing and I appreciate that they went above and beyond for us to make this experience nothing less than perfect.  Thank you all and big thanks to our server Jason! ",5
 Best birthday menu ever.  Had a great time.  The staff accommodated our requests.  Food was perfectly prepared.  I can’t stop thinking of my birthday celebration. ,5
" Great service.  They printed up a special birthday menu for our table (it was my mother's b-day).  Fun food choices, like the ""Vietnamese Pig Ears"" (tasted like bacon).  Deep Fried Olives with Pistachios were amazing!  Cocktails were elegant and creative.  Will return soon. ",5
 We visit this area once a year and try to eat at Goose &amp; Gander at least twice! Love the downstairs atmosphere and the staff is super knowledgeable about all the food and drinks. The bone marrow burger with duck fat fries is amazing! I have dreams about that burger because it is so good. We also tried the Sunday supper prime rib special this time and it was great. This is a must visit restaurant! It’s an all time favorite of ours! ,5
 We came here for my wife’s birthday.  The server did a great job making this a special occassion with little things like customizing the menu to say Happy Birthday. The food was amazing and was an overall wonderful experience.  Will defiantly come back and recommend it to anyone! ,5
 Fabulous!  I had one small issue and the server corrected it immediately without a problem.  The food was extraordinary and the wine list is extensive.  Can bring a bottle if you wish.  The corkage is $20.  Will return soon! ,5
" What a cool English hunting lodge minus  the stuffed game. It’s cozy, unstuffy and downright friendly. The “Coolest Bar in the World” downstairs . The staff were so knowledgeable, had a great grasp of their menu as well as the and Great cocktails. Hell, it’s the “Martini House”. So glad they kept the Martini House Mushroom Soup. Outstanding! ",5
" Went for lunch based on open table review.  Two ladies for a midweek lunch.  Love it all!  Awsome ambience next to fireplace.  Wanna go back during warm weather to sit for drinks in downstairs bar or outside patio.   Food met expectations for napa valley lunch; Mushroom soup was delish, a loved fried chicken Sandwich.  Plan to go back with large group to sit in private dining room! ",5
" The food was delicious but the service left a bit to be desired.  Our table of 5 ordered 4 appetizer for one couple to share as dinner, and 2 main course, and one person not eating due to illness ; now, as a restaurant manager I understand that the server may have been disappointed, but her abrupt change in attitude from pleasant to overtly rude was unacceptable.  While the meal was delicious and her attitude softened a bit by the end of service, it definitely put a large damper on the overall experience. ",5
" Amazing food, service and ambiance! ",5
 Everything is delicious but bit heavy! Go hungry. ,4
 It was absolutely wonderful to find the rare bourbon Pappy Van Winkle. What a treat that was. ,5
" Really appreciated the cocktails in the downstairs bar. Well executed and tasty. We ordered food and were a little less thrilled. Some of the dishes were good, but others were just off. Either were really bland, weren’t hot or some other thing that just made the dishes miss. Mushroom soup was fantastic though. ",3
 Bar downstairs is great very speakeasy esque. Bartenders are extremely talented ,5
 Got the burger with bone marrow and it was good! A little messy. Also got the chicken wings wet which had great flavor but too spicy for some. Corn croquettes were OK. Old fashioned was great. Server was great. Ambiance like a lodge. ,4
 Food and service were excellent. I was a little disappointed that a $19 burger came with a soggy bottom bun. ,4
 Ben was thoughtful and amazing ,5
 Vince in the bar was great.  Cocktails are very creative and food is great and reasonably sized portions ,5
" We went for dinner to celebrate our anniversary and received complimentary champagne as soon as we sat down.  For appetizers, we ordered fried olives/crispy pistachios and grilled Spanish octopus. Both were excellent.  For the main entree, we ordered the prime rib and pork chop. The pork chop was so tender, juicy and very flavorful.  Prime rib was very good but had too much fat in it. We ordered the Basque cake for dessert which was awesome! I would highly recommend this dessert. Great dining experience overall. ",5
" Thoroughly enjoyed our dinner at Goose and Gander.  The waiter was excellent as was the food and atmosphere and of course, the cocktails.  Highly recommend the mushroom soup and the Basque cake for dessert! ",5
 We loved it so much we went back the next night. The food was perfect. The restaurant was quiet and cozy and really great service. No question that we will be back time and time again. ,5
" The food was good. The wild mushroom tartine was excellent, fresh and full of delicious flavors, but a small portion. The poule grand-mere was large and adequate to taste, but nothing worth reordering. The fried pickles were heavily deep fried (think KFC), but the mayonnaise dip was delicious. The wine list was lacking, and expensive for a typical Napa dining experience.   The restaurant is relatively new, and we had been warned by both our hotel and others that had been there that it was okay. There is a large patio, which will be amazing during the summer months, but make sure you request indoor if you are off season. We saw people freezing under heat lamps in early April.   Also, if you are ordering a glass of wine, be careful. The wine comes out of a tap and tends to come served over aerated (with bubbles) and an odd taste that mellows out after a few minutes. The side affect is that wines you may know taste completely different.   Overall the meal for the price was good, it is just not what we expected. I am not an aficionado on Creole, but I did grow up in the south and like to think I know good creole. ",3
 Enjoyed ALL this restaurant had to offer.  Finally found a fantastic tasting Margarita :-) ,5
" The setting out of doors is ruined by covering the entire area so that you cannot see the sky. It did not feel like outside. The Salad Maison was lettuce  with a few paper thin slices of tiny radishes. Quite droll. The entree was Croque Maison. As with Croque Madame, it had a fried egg on top, but it and the entire sandwich was covered with copious amounts of a sauce that reminded me of basic gravy. Inside the sandwich was a tiny amount of paper thin pieces of bacon which could not be tasted over the gravy. The bread was soggy, yet difficult to cut with a sharp knife. The desert of German layer cake was the worst desert I have ever been served in a fine restaurant.   I will say the service was very good, but I go back to a restaurant for the food not the service. I would pass on another visit to Evangeline and go to Sam's Social Club where the food is far superior in a far superior outdoor setting.  This restaurant is supposedly run by the folks at SolBar at Solage, a Michelin star restaurant. Sorry but it doesn't compare. ",2
" This is the second time my friends and I have visited Evangeline's and we all enjoyed the outdoor setting which was warm, inviting and comfortable. Our food was excellent but  we thought that the portions for entrees were small; we've ordered Salade Nicoise, Poisson Eau Fou and  Shrimp Etouffee. Maybe if there was bread which is a staple in France, maybe not New Orleans, it would be more satisfying. ",4
" We are foodies and dine out in Calistoga every weekend.  The food at Evangeline is excellent, creative, and a welcome addition to Calistoga.  The Duck Rillette is exceptional and the Cheese Platter is superb.  The pork shoulder is fantastic. We have ordered the Salad Nicoise for lunch on multiple occasions and it s the best entree salad in Napa Valley.  The prices are extremely fair and reasonable for a fine dining experience.  We have had lunch and dinner outdoors and indoors and the ambiance for each is enjoyable and romantic.   We highly recommend this restaurant to anyone that is looking for an excellent meal.   Please disregard the ""Calistoga'sFoodie's"" review, Evangeline provides a better value than Sam's Social Club and we have dined at both restaurants several times.  Evangeline is a Napa Valley gem and is well regarded by foodies and locals. ",4
" This new Calistoga restaurant is a total delight, from the beautiful setting to the delicious food.  The staff is friendly and helpful, the ambience is casual and yet elegant, the pace is relaxed, it is a real treat.  We can't wait to go back to Calistoga to enjoy this wonderful restaurant again! ",5
" We had a wonderful lunch to celebrate my Aunt's birthday.  Their special of the day (friday) was Shrimp Etouffee and 3 at our table (of 4) ordered this.  The etouffee  was fabulous - wonderful, rich sauce with just a hint of spice,  very generous portions of shrimp all creating a melange of Creole flavors.  The hush puppies were perfect - crispy on the outside and tender cornmeal inside.   The out door courtyard was lovely.  Ceiling heat lamps kept the temperature perfect.  All in all a perfect lunch in a perfect setting.  Cant wait to go back! ",5
" This was my second visit to Evangeline. The first was at night indoors, the second was daytime outdoors. The outdoor experience is the best. If you go at night they have outdoor heaters if needed. The outdoor patio is lovely and the service is just as competent as indoors. The food is outstanding and I would definitely recommend the grilled  Brussels sprouts to share at the table. ",5
" Ordered a bowl of the Oyster Stew and it arrived in a large bowl but could have easily fit into a cup. Was also very salty.  Wife ordered the beet salad and it was laughably small. We're talking about 4-5 bites.  We split the Grand Ma's chick, thinking we'd get more. It was one leg/wing and 1/2 a breast with about two tablespoons of root vegetables and a 1/4 cup of pureed potatoes. ",3
" It was a Saturday night and the restaurant was on the quite side.  Service was good but not exceptional. Good was tasty and well presented but nothing exceptional.  Portions were small. Patio seating was nice.  We all enjoyed our evening but again, nothing that special or different about it other than the nice outdoor seating.  I will try it again in the near future. ",4
" We are still savoring the memory of our lunch at Evangeline - of the six restaurants we visited over two recent weekends in Calistoga, Evangeline rises head and shoulders above the rest.  Every dish was prepared with careful attention to a balance of flavors and the freshest of ingredients - it was reminiscent of some of the best meals we've had at Chez Panisse in Berkeley...deceptively simple presentation of complex dishes, such as the oyster stew, which my mother ordered with some hesitation, assuming it could not possibly be as good as the one my grandmother used to make. The relatively small bowl of stew contained more rich and subtle flavor than she could have imagined...and the same would be said for my oxtail-barley soup - a lovely broth with the infusion of red wine that was utterly delightful.  My sister raved about her crab/artichoke/fennel salad - again, a deceptively small portion that contained a world of flavor.  We were not as taken by the desserts, but that may be a work in progress. Overall, this is the meal that we return to in memory again and again.  Do not come here if your idea of a great meal is a plate full of visual drama and hit you over the head portions and spices.  Come here if you want to savor every mouthful, recognize fresh ingredients, and enjoy absolutely top-notch service in a delightful setting. ",5
" Evangeline is a great addition to the Calistoga dining scene. The food is both interesting and delicious, not the same things you find on every other menu in the area. We began with some very creative cocktails and tasty fried pickles.  The shrimp cocktail consisted of several large, sweet shrimp and was fairly priced. The oyster stew was nicely seasoned, but the oysters were more finely chopped then I would have preferred. The Salad Nicoise was lovely but could have had more capers. The crispy braised pork shoulder was very good.  The Poulet Grand-mere was a hit with my husband.  I enjoyed the poissin eau fou but it felt more like a starter than a main course. Desserts include Three Twins Ice Cream, a local favorite, as well as a good-looking tarte tatin. The wine list is small but well chosen.  Corkage is free for the first bottle. But the real star attraction at Evangeline is the setting.  The outdoor patio is the prettiest outdoor dining spot in the area. It's perfect for the upcoming summer months. ",4
 My husband and I had a fantastic dinner here on a romantic night away to Calistoga. Excellent food and service in a lovely outdoor setting. ,5
 I liked this place because the menu was different with many intriguing options which were all very reasonably priced. The food was well-prepared and service was very good. We dined at the bar and it was quiet enough that evening that the bartender was able to give an appropriate level of attention. We definitely plan on going back. ,4
" Our second time at this restaurant. The food is excellent; for the second time we enjoyed the Boe uf Bourguignon  which was excellent. We also enjoyed the Emmer Roasted Chicken-a very good dish but , we thought it overpriced at 45$. The Baby Garden Lettuce salad was delicious as was the Roasted Baby Beet  salad. We had an extraordinary Zinfandel from the Napa Valley-2012 Brown Family Rosemary's Block; one of the best Zins I have ever had. Highly recommend this restaurant although pricing is a little high. ",5
" I liked the ambiance, the food was only fair but I think they are just breaking in.  My tuna nicoise salad had creamy tuna flakes vs pieces of fresh tuna that you would expect.  My partner ordered Steak Frite - again just fair, steak cooked rare which was good but slightly tough.  The starter charcuterie was the best part of the meal.  We brought our own wine - -a french burgandy I and waiter was knowledgeable of it, no corkage on the first bottle.  I think this restaurant has potential so will try it again.  But the food didnt hit the mark. ",3
" Although there are heaters around and about, it is absurd to think that you could have an enjoyable evening while eating outside in February. Service was spotty at best. The food was tasty, but overpriced. It was a true disappointment. ",2
" Nothing terrible happened,  but no wow factor either. Very small portion sizes. Oysters were great, but no mignonette spoon, fishy tasting Crab app, flavorless smoked salmon app, main courses left something to be desired. Steak and frites had a 1980's style pad of butter and the dish look unappetizing, chicken looked butter but small portion, fish po boy had decent flavor but looked boring as plated. The service was fine but they are certainly in the business of auctioning off food/drinks/etc. Hope things get better, Calistoga really needs great places! ",3
" we would come again. The service and setting was really lovely. The food was good, but the petrale sole broth a bit salty for your taste. The wines were well priced and a very good variety to choose from. We thought the setting was great and overall it was a very lovely evening. ",4
" I had dinner with several other people at Evangeline the Sunday after Valentine's Day.  The food was tasty and varied - the desserts were especially good - and the service was attentive, but it had some hitches as well.  (It may be that they had not recovered from a busy Valentine's Day, but it felt a little more like they had not quite sorted things out yet.)  One of my companions ordered a drink that the bar did not know how to make, but it took two trips and a fairly long time for the waiter to explain why it had not been delivered yet and to ask for a substitution.  When we requested bread, we were told it was $1 per serving, which seemed odd considering how pricey the meal was.   They have a nice array of flavors and some slightly interesting preparations (the salad Nicoise was on a bed of egg rather than greens), and the servings are on the small side, so you can (and will want to) combine two or three choices for a meal.  The desserts were wonderful, dense and flavorful.  (We had Tarte Tatin and a waffle and Nutella thing.)  Most of the dining area is outside, patio-style, covered with trellises.  I expect it is quite lovely on a nice day, but in the evening it was a bit chilly and the heating where we were was inconsistent.  I don't consider this their fault, but I would definitely plan accordingly - go during the day or dress warm.  In all, I may go back again, but I would probably choose it for lunch on a quiet day. ",3
 Read about this restaurant in Mud City press.  Love the area and wanted to try something new.  The Wine list was great and the setting delightful.  The service was great but the food was just OK at best.  Probably would go somewhere else next time. ,2
 A welcome and needed addition to the calistoga dining scene. We will definitely return soon ,4
" This is a great addition to the local restaurant scene. California-influenced bistro fare that is excellent without being too ""fussy"". Nice variety of dishes, and moderately priced. Each in our group of 4 ordered something different, and they were all good. Looking forward to going back. ",4
" Unfortunately, in the winter months, the inside restaurant is VERY small, and unpleasantly noisy. The noise totally prevented us from having a nice dining experience.  We are looking forward to the patio dining. Too bad the other half of the property is not going to be used for dining  THANK YOU, as locals, for the corkage policy. ",3
" We sat outside and though the restaurant was in the first week of opening, we thought everything was top notch. The menu is wonderful and we look forward to visiting often! The smoked salmon starter is not to be missed and the fried pickles were wonderful with sparkling wine! ",5
" Rather bad and disappointing. OK if unremarkable appetizers (country pate and sweetbreads), one good main (beef bourgignon), one terrible main (duck cassoulet, with duck hard as a hockey puck). Amateur service too. We bring a bottle of (very red!) 2000 Left Bank Bordeaux, and they give us tiny white wine glasses, which they then full to the brink? In Napa? Really? We could see from afar that they had appropriate glassware in the bar.  Oh, and the music they play. Boy oh boy. Julio Iglesias was their most contemporary selection. Bizarre experience. I have no idea why this place has good reviews.  Bad food, bad service, horrible ambiance (unless you are into Julio Iglesias, Eros Ramazzotti, and related gems... and of course nothing says French bistro more than Julio Iglesias). ",1
 Angele is one of our favorite NAPA Restaurants. It’s fabulous in every way. ,5
 This was our first time at Angele.  We both had salad that were delicious.  The decor and cuisine is authentic French country-style.  A great place for lunch or dinner. ,4
" Once again, great food and warm and cozy on a raw January afternoon. Can't wait 'til warm weather and patio seating! ",4
" A true Napa Valley institution, Angele has been around for 15 years and consistently delivering one of the best dining experiences in Napa. Amazing French cuisine, seasonally inspired and prepared to perfection, it is a neighborhood gem catering to locals and tourists alike. The service is simply outstanding with a highly trained and professional wait staff, the ambiance is top notch,  reminiscent of a cozy French countryside bistro. The location is fantastic, right on the Napa river, close to Napa's hotels with ample easy parking options. Cannot recommend enough! ",5
" Always special, we started with oysters, then the wonderful sweetbread appetizer, followed by the sole, which was excellent, and my husband had the ""chicken salad"", which was recommended by Javier.  He usually loves the steak frites, and the salad with farro and greens was interesting, but he will get the steak when we return again. We tried all flavors of the homemade ice cream, which were fantastic, and the spiced caramel ice cream was over the top. We always love the atmosphere of a French countryside inn , with the charming little olive tree plants on the tables and and the view of the river through the French blue window frames.  Lovely! ",5
" Angele was a little more expensive than we normally are comfortable with, but the food was excellent and delivered to our table in a surprisingly short amount of time.  The restaurant is on the waterfront, but in late January, we were inside, so we wouldn't have noticed this if we hadn't  seen it on a map. ",4
" Brunch, lunch, and dinner have all been top notch. Service is warm, professional, speedy, and not too intrusive. The food has consistently been impeccable, which is why we have made this our go-to restaurant as Napa locals. ",5
" This was a great find. Not pretentious, just great food &amp; great service. Also an ideal location downtown on the river. Was there in January so too cold too eat outside, cannot wait to go back &amp; sit outside to enjoy the view. I highly recommend this restaurant! ",4
 French Onion soup is to die for   Great spot next to the river ,5
 We love the food and the staff if very friendly ,5
 The food was outstanding. Very attentive service ,5
" Angèle was recommended to us - so we knew we had to come and try it. It was restaurant week only there was no entree for me so we ordered off of the menu. We ordered the BV Cab and began with the escargot for my husband which he enjoyed every morsel. I got the beet and goat cheese salad. The presentation was beautiful.  As always, I took my time and enjoyed every bite.  The only issue was that as soon as I finished my salad, another waiter took my plate and put my entree down. It’s never good to rush a person through dinner.  We both ordered the trout. It is served )with the skin on) over green beans. It is cooked to perfection and the skin is easy to remove. It is also served with a parsnip purée that is outstanding. We highly recommend the trout.  Most people around us were ordering the Boeuf Bourguignon - it was part of the Restaurant week menu. They seemed to enjoy it.  We like to end a meal with a good dessert and unfortunately, we were disappointed. We ordered the “Profiterole” cream puff with vanilla bean ice cream and warm chocolate sauce. It was pre-set in the plate and pulled from the freezer - how do I know?? I’m a foody. The pastry was stale and the ice cream had freezer burn. My husband wouldn’t let me send it back.  The waiter should have known I didn’t like it. When he asked if I wanted dessert I indicated it was my religion.  I only took two bites —  I actually checked the dessert twice.  Good food. Good wine list. Skip dessert. People Next to us got the bread pudding and they didn’t finish it either. ",5
" The soup special, the Brussels sprouts and the hamburger (with fries) excellent! We washed it all done with a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc! We have dined here many times and will be back again! ",5
 Ok restaurant. Small and intimate. ,3
 This was our first time  at this restaurant. The food was excellent and we are going to return for a more in-depth  experience. Recommended! ,5
" My friend and I enjoyed an evening at Angele for two reasons:  it’s restaurant week in Napa Valley and we are preparing a French dinner for 6 to fulfill an auction lot so had to do some research. We had a three course dinner starting with a duck spread (there is a fancier.name) for Iris and a lovely green salad for me. Then she had mushroom risotto and I had beef bourginon, both of which were delightful. To top it off, there was bread pudding with bourbon ice cream. We paired all of this with Napa Valley wines of course. We loved the special attention from our server Dan and all the staff at Angele. A memorable evening! ",5
" Food was phenomenal. Boeuf Bourguignon was excellent, Brussel Sprouts with Lardon and Beet Salad we’re also excellent. Cocktails were surprisingly good. Service was attentive and knowledgeable. Highly recommended. ",5
" Exceptional, as always! Service doesn't miss a beat, even when they are packed. Food is incredible; well ececuted, full flavor, conversation stopping dishes that leave you fully satisfied! ",5
" We've eaten here many times.  This week it was a rainy cold night outside but inside we were warm and cozy. We dined on a French meal, like we were back in Paris.  Just outstanding. ",5
 Always love it! ,5
" Absolutely delicious and the staff was so friendly, and helpful!  They treated us like we were family guests.  There was a chicken dish served with french fries and a black truffle dip that was out of this world!  As was the steak tartar appetizer. ",5
" My husband and I went there to celebrate my birthday. The food was okay. But the service was quite disappointing. We were initially assigned to a table only 1.5 meters away facing the main entrance. Due to the whether, it was very cold and windy so we requested to change the seat. No one else was given that table afterwards. The waiter tended to ignore our table as well. All other tables got there bread and butter (some of them got their second/third rounds already) but we were never given even after we requested that. Finally during the meal, we got the bread and with no apology at all. Also, I ordered Jasmine tea and some how I got a kind of black tea. Not sure how other people like this place but I will not be there again. We are Asian, discrimination? We were definitely treated differently. ",1
" After a long day in the vineyards, we were looking forward to some food to balance out the day’s consumption. Although we were seated in the quietest room of the restaurant (thankfully!) it was still too loud to really enjoy the experience ...and thus the food. Maybe if it was the time of year we could have eaten outside, our impression of Angele’s would have been better. Maybe another time... ",3
" 4 friends win charity auction item w/a  $200 Angele gift card.  We decided to use it during weekend Napa getaway. Upon arrival 15 mins early for our 7:30 reservation, a polite  young hostess informs they're waiting on entire room to pay &amp; will seat us as soon as an opening's available &amp; invites us to wait at entry or bar- No waiting area except 2 occupied seats.  Scan bar area, it's packed 2 rows deep &amp; standing room only; to an uncomfortable level.  Tried to be courteous &amp; move to the side to unblock  frt door &amp; allow staff to pass thru their only route, but then we were blocking kitchen. We moved back to front desk.  Another hostess, the older of the two &amp; obviously ""manager in charge"" based on her demeanor, approached the desk &amp;  asked if we had been helped.  I told her we had &amp; thanked her.  A minute later, she asked for name on our reserv. &amp; informed me that we were ""early""-at now-7 min to ""R""- (Uh, should we be late?)-she commanded we  wait in bar area.  I politely inquired how one might do that?  Her response -""there's a standing bar all along that side of the dining room"". Scan bar again, note no one has moved &amp; notice we would be standing over dining tables of other patrons by doing this, um, rude! Didn't move, &amp; obviously annoyed her!  Poor layout not our fault- Bad 1st impression, ma'am, reflected in rating! Get to table 7:35&amp; had the most fabulous, lovely dinner served by great, attentive staff!  Every course served was superb! All agreed FR Onion Soup was best we ever tasted &amp; entrees were delicious.  TIPS: Ask waiter if anything comes w/entrée bec menu doesn't mention- ordered extra veggies &amp; French fries (HUGE) but yummy sautéed veg on plate made extras unnecessary.  Our GC covered about 1/2 bill for 4; pricey.  We brought wine &amp; there's a $25 Corkage Fee, but by buying a $50 bottle, they waived fee &amp; we had more wine! Arrive exactly on time to avoid wait-avoid Sat night!  Request table opposite bar side.  Enjoy the wonderful meal! ",4
" If you're browsing OpenTable, trying to decide between restaurants.... Should it be Bouchon, should it be Morimoto... No, it should be Angele. ",5
" Great setting by the river.  Sweetbreads were awesome, couldn’t be better.  My friend loved her chicken, moist and tender.  Martinis also very good.  Will definitely return ",5
" Unfortunately we were next to a very large noisy party. The menu was limited forcing us to make unusual choices, but it was good. ",4
" Angele was excellent as always.  My daughter and  I love to go there especially for lunch.  It is just a delightful bistro and we can pretend we are in Paris, one of our favorite cities for bistro lunches.  We had a delicious omelette with ham, gruyere, spinach and chanterelles and a bistro sandwich with warm bread and saucisson sec paired with delicious beer. Such fun. ",5
" Upon arrival the person at the desk was less than friendly.   He turned out to be our waiter, and the personality didn't improve.  After noticing many other wait staff taking bread to other tables we asked for some.  After some time he brought the bread, told us more was in the oven and would bring it out.  Never happened.  Then the waiter disappeared and we had to find someone else to take our payment.  The name of the waiter was on the receipt but we are  not divulging it in case he was having strong personal problems that day.  We periodically try Angele and would have to say it is not worth the price. ",2
" My best friend and I have been meeting once or twice a year at Angele for the past decade. It is a pleasure to dine at this casual, French country restaurant. Today, the sweetbreads with mushrooms we’re fabulous, the Salad Lyonaisse(frisée, lentils and a poached egg) was very good, and the sole meunière was perfection - the vegetables on the plate were done just right and tasted like they were picked this morning. We finished our meal with the bourbon bread pudding, which was lovely.  Our waiter was attentive and helpful. Angele reminds me of Provence, and the great meals my husband and I had in France. ",5
 Wonderful  place for lunch or dinner ,5
" We eat here on a regular basis and the food, service and atmosphere never disappoints.  We are locals and have separated the tourist restaurants from the good restaurants and this is in the later group. ",5
" Amazing view, great food and service. ",5
 The restaurant is lovely. Open Table's star rating is way off in terms of cost. They rated it with 2 stars which in mind estimation means reasonably priced. I spent $250 on a dinner for two. That is very expensive and should be rated as such. ,3
 Great place to eat ,5
" Wonderful food, and great location and ambiance! ",5
 Excellent experience. Well managed restaurant. Service was fantastic. ,5
 Everything was wonderful ,5
" Difficult to rate a restaurant when the food was poor. My sea bass when placed before me and ""smelled"" of fish = not fresh. My husbands scallops were fair. Our nephews veal stew was overcooked and tasteless.  We were very disappointed and will never go back or recomend Angele's Restaurant. Also, our nephew, who is in the wine biz. brought along a very small barrel taste which we were charged a corkage fee for as well as the bottle of wine he brought along. ",2
 One of the best dining experiences in Napa. Great location with very good food and service. ,4
" We had a lovely meal at Angele.  They honored our request for a quiet table, and the service was very good.  They had a soup special that was fantastic, and the rest of the meal was very good.  I would certainly go back and would suggest Angele to friends. ",5
" A most enjoyable French bistro. Note that our ""quiet"" rating above refers to Angele's patio dining, where we ate both lunch and dinner on March 8, 2008. Inside was crowded and quite loud during dinner. ",4
" We made reservation for our anniversary throug open table. Not one word was said to us about ""Happy Anniversary"". We've dined at Angele's for several special occasions. We ordered the Filet which was a featured item. When it arrived it should have been labeled 1/2 a tapas portion, and in two little pieces, on not larger than maybe a medium egg and the other maybe an walnut. Even more suprising was the $40.00 price tag. We normally go to Cole's Chop house which is just down the street, but thought we'd try Angele's again. Next time we're going to Cole's for larger portions.   Sincerely, Heather McCollister 1512 D ST Napa, CA 94559 ",5
" I am a Napa local who used to love this place, but the food has really gone downhill in the last year or so. It pains me to say this, but my past several dining experiences have been mediocre at best - - many courses have been severely lacking in taste, which is such a disappointment because the service is normally great and the ambiance is wonderful as well. The food just isn't what it used to be when the old executive chef was on board. For all the people who have loved their dining experience here as of late - - you should have dined here a few years ago because back then it was really something to write home about! Overall I think there are many better choices for dining while in the valley where incredible food can be guaranteed. ",2
 Absolutely Fabulous!!! ,5
 An excellent evening is guaranteed at Angele. It is a great asset to Napa Valley dining. ,4
" Wonderful lunch.  We go here quite often since it is a few blocks from work.  The lunch is perfect with a great menu, delicious food, lovely wine selections, and a perfect ambiance.  This particular lunch we had an incredible omelet, oysters, and the vegetable tartine.  Everything was perfect.  We will be back next week! ",5
" French restaurant on the Napa River at the end of Main Street in the town of Napa.  We ate outdoors in an area where they had a windscreen.  It was cool and it was the end of June.  Without the windscreen,  it would not be enjoyable. ",4
" Special place to celebrate a birthday, even though the waiter forgot until the very end of our last course.  Food was excellent, fresh and beautifully served. ",4
" Superb all around. Ate outside near heaters just before sunset. Halibut excellent, as was roast chicken. Deviled eggs were different and delicious. Definitely recommend. Lively crowd - all having a great time. ",5
 Excellent service very pretty place. the portions very small too small ,3
 Amazingly fresh food and excellent service! ,5
" Food was rather bland, and although billed as Basque, we could find no hint of that. Portions fairly small. ",3
 Excellent service.  Respected the slower pace of our dining experience.  Attentive but not invasive to our conversation.  Very nice touch to offer sparkling wine for our anniversary.  Noticed that all parties surrounding us were receiving excellent service.  Food was delicious.  Beautiful presentation ,5
" We had good memories from a prior visit so came here again before a show at the Uptown. We sat outside on a beautiful night, able to converse without raising our voices, not at all a common experience these days. The complimentary warm bread was outstanding, with a crisp, almost burnt  in spots crust  and a deliciously  flavorful light interior. For first courses, we had the gazpacho and the cucumber salad with greens fresh from their own garden. The gazpacho was good, not great,  and had some oil spots on the surface which were a distraction. The lemon cucumbers were fresh, sweet and the presentation very appealing. For main courses, we had the beet salad and the sole. My wife enjoyed the salad. It was a nice portion, very colorful, fresh with a good variety of ingredients. My sole was done just right and tasty, but the sauce and lentils made the whole dish brown and visually unappealing -  the exact opposite of the bright colors of the salad across from me.  The profiteroles for dessert were excellent, among the best I've had (and I've had a lot of them over the years!)  The coffee was very smooth and the house sancerre, available by the carafe, was a perfect pairing on a warm night outside. The overall meal was paced nicely, the service was casual and friendly, yet professional and attentive. We had plenty of time for the short walk to the theater.  I can recommend Angele as a great place to go for a date or a pre-show dinner. I expect we'll go back again when visiting Napa. ",4
 Always a nice meal on the patio.  The food and drinks are very good. ,5
 Excellent food and service ,5
 Had to ask for bread.  Squash blossoms were dull.  Steak was tough. Coffee was decent.  Nice covered terrace for outdoor dining but I chose the noisy inside near the bar.  C+ ,3
" This was my second visit although a few years apart. Very good service, lovely setting on the river (actually reminiscent of parts of France), and fresh, delicious food. I visited after a long wine-tasting, and my friend and I shared two salads (roast chicken and nicoise) and a pot of $9 French fries. We enjoyed  the moment, the setting and food, although the salads weren't especially memorable.  Lovely dining setting that is clearly subscribed to by the economic elite. ",4
 Fabulous food. Beautiful ambiance. Attentive service. Outdoor patio is perfect. ,5
 Never any issues.... alway great go too... never gets  old!! ,5
" I reserved a table for my 50th birthday celebration and asked to dine al fresco.  The website made it seem like there was riverside dining.  Not so.  Two parties of two could sit at small tables with a river view.  All the other outdoor tables do not have a water view.  I was surprised that no one said 'Happy Birthday,' as it was noted in the reservation, and I'm pretty sure I announced it upon arrival.  (Not a big thing, but a nice touch.)  The waiter was pretty oblivious and generally seemed like he didn't care.  My pescatarian friend was very disappointed to pay $30+ for a piece of overcooked halibut.  The appetizers were very good.  Given the number of options in Napa Valley for special occasion dining, I would not recommend Angele. ",2
" Angele is always outstanding!  Creative menu, rotating menu items, superb service and great setting. This time I met friends there for lunch.  I came from Walnut Creek and they came from Santa Rosa.  Napa is half-way.  Unfortunately, I was 30 minutes late thanks to a dead battery.  Angele was most accommodating, showing my friends to our table and serving them drinks whilst waiting for me.  VERY much appreciated.  5 star place! Thank you rbmiller, Walnut Creek ",5
" Great as usual, this time for a business lunch. Two courses, lovely crudo nd then salmon tartine. ",5
" More French food options - please ! We enjoyed having a birthday lunch to celebrate my long time partner - only he keeps asking me why there were not more French cuisine options on the menu.  He ordered a burger as that what was most appealing to him from the menu choices.  My Croque Monsieur was good BUT not served on the correct bread :( - sorry to point out this issue as the bread was tasty, but not for a traditional CM -it was an earthy, rustic Italian style bread - wrong !! Staff was lovely - the servers, the hostess, etc. -  everyone was pleasant - I had several questions that were answered promptly and with efficiency. A surprise sampling of ice cream with a birthday candle came at the end; nice touch - thanks for that ! ",3
" Angele never disappoints. Our last meal was just as expected, perfect. ",5
" Nice small river side setting,  good food and drink with great service ",4
 The food was great! We loved that the tomatoes were right out of the garden. ,5
" We came here for an anniversary trip dinner and had a great time! Beautiful outdoor seating, delicious French butter with our charcuterie starter, and my mussels were yummy! ",5
 Quite good. We encountered no problems.  The ingredients were local and fresh. ,5
" We always enjoy dining at Angele. The wait staff is always friendly, and the ambience in the patio is wonderful. However, today service was not up to par. I had to keep asking for refills for my ice tea and refills for the bread basket. On one occasion I asked for an ice tea refill, more bread, and salt and pepper. I got 2 of my 3 requests. It was not worth asking again for salt and pepper.  The salad nicoise seemed to have more vinegar in the dressing than it used to have, and croque monsieur had an herb in it that was distracting. All in all, we will probably come back, but not for a while, and perhaps we will offer different entrees. ",4
" If you like French Bistro you will like this place! Great food, Great bar, Dinning is very relaxed! ",4
" As always, flawless, inviting and cordial service, fabulous and seasonal food and great atmosphere -- ",5
" This was our third visit to Angele and our best experience.  I had the fish and my husband had steak frites.  Both dishes were very good--bordered on being too salty, but didn't cross that line but it was a close call.  Service was very attentive and friendly. ",4
 Angele is one of my 'go to' restaurants in Napa. The Salad Nicoise is excellent and my lunch choice 80% of the time. Lunch at the bar is a great option. ,5
 Always fresh food and delicious! ,4
 Anniversary ,4
" Great stop downtown Napa. Very knowledgeable service staff, great food . Nothing wrong here. ",5
" Lovely outdoor setting with an attentive, but not intrusive staff. Nicoise Salad was light and fresh with just the right amount of dressing. Omelet Du Jour was a lovely blend of ham and guyere cheese....with a complementary salad of mixed greens.  Interesting drinks and large wine list by the bottle. More wines by the glass would be nice. Freshly made strawberry sorbet and a strawberry tart from local produce topped off an utterly delightful lunch for two. ",5
 Excellent cuisine and service! We will return in the future. ,5
" I used to love Angele, but lately it's become boring and overpriced. The soup seemed no different than V-8 juice with a few cucumbers. The charcuterie was good but sparse and overpriced. My bouillabaisse had a boring broth with a few mussels , some flavorless lobster, a lump of fish sitting on top so it absorbed no flavor and TOO many potatoes. I never saw potatoes in bouillabaisse before.  They should see if they can find a menu from ten years ago and revive it. Also, they reported us to Open Table for not showing up for our reservation, even though we were five minutes early and spent over $ 200. The waiter was very nice and the other staff also. ",2
" Not at all what I was expecting. Quite disappointed with the food too, I was expecting French and it wasn't really. The best part of the dining was the drinks. ",2
" I've been there 4 times now...value is not even close. Over cooked fish, improper preparation product, so expensive for less than what you get at nearby restaurants. Identity crisis at its best...is it a bistro, is it fine dining??? Honestly, I have never written about restaurants, but this place has always disappointed me and I can't keep throwing money at it. I'm sad to say it but I have given it numerous chances and always lets me down. ",2
" Staff was very disinterested and really didn't even pretend to care.  Very weird vibes from everyone working there, uncomfortable.    Had good reviews, but we were very very disappointed.  Would not go back or recommend to anyone.  Look elsewhere! ",1
" Great spot for lunch tasty dishes, great wine selection, great patio vew and ambiance ",5
" Location, Ambiance and a very high quality of food.  Sit deep in the restaurant and your in France or outside and your on the Napa river.  I've never had a meal here that I didn't love. ",5
" Angele is lovely, either inside or outside for both lunch, brunch or dinner with a French feel. We LOVE it ",4
 We love this restaurant! It's close and it's familiar. And it is also spectacular! We were there for a simple Saturday lunch and it was like we were on a luxurious holiday. We had deviled eggs and a nice bottle of Keep rosé from Napa to start. My wife had grilled chicken and I had a bavette steak. Both were delicious! We had coffee and a chocolate mousse for dessert. You simply cannot go wrong with Angèle! ,5
 What a great experience and fantastic service. Thank you for a memorable evening ,5
 Extremely slow and erratic service.  Waited an hour between appetizer and entree.  Wait staff noticed we were sitting there for a long time without for and ignored us.  Even after asking about the timing it took a long time just to get an update.  Nobody came by to inquire about how our food was.  After the entree we waited another half an hour for anyone to come by for the check or dessert menu.   Food was average and unremarkable.  Duck confit was on the dry side. ,2
 Every time we visit Napa we come to Angele. The food and cocktails are amazing! We are never disappointed! The duck confit was so dilicious! Can't wait to come back again. ,5
 Great wine selection; fantastic salads and sandwiches; professional serving staff and a wonderful outdoor atmosphere make this restaurant a gem.   Enjoy!!! ,4
" Good food, moderately priced.   Good service.  We just sampled a few appetizers but overall they were good.  Had a truffled cheese on the cheese plate that was great. ",4
 Service was eratic_believe they may have been understaffed. ,4
" This place is underrated.  Food is terrific, service great.  Chef have an innovative approach to food.  Highly recommend. ",5
 Delicious food and awesome handcrafted cocktails. Will definitely return. ,5
 We had a great time.  It was Fathers Day and the weather was very warm.  It was quieter than usual but everyone was great from the bartender to the table staff.  Food was excellent. We'll be back. ,5
" Wow, tough night for this restaurant. Probably just having a bad night. Had to switch tables due to allergies which they very graciously accommodated.   Then it all went south. It seemed they were missing hands in the kitchen and on the floor.   Perhaps a higher rating on the next trip. My chicken dinner was kind of light on the chicken as well. Unfortunately, few redeeming qualities on this visit.  ADDED NOTE Okay, so I need to share an unusual experience. Aaron from Angele called me after We got home. He shared he was calling all the guests from that evening and extending their apologies and an invitation to make up the difficult experience on our next visit to the restaurant.   A classy, top notch move on their part and I felt the conversation with Aaron was sincere. Five stars for the follow up! ",3
 Service was very slow. Over an hour to get our food. Server was non existent. People were walking out for lack of attention. Aaron the new manager was very nice but overwhelmed. Came for my birthday dinner and will not be back again. Very disappointed ,1
" Angele can be counted on to provide a lovely dining experience, with great food, comfortable seating, beautiful view of the Napa River and very attentive staff.  As locals, we love it and our guests were very pleased with the food and ambience. ",4
" Always have a superb meal here – had never lunched here, but not only met our expectations but exceeded them. The fried deviled eggs done to order and the muscles in the unctuous broth were two particular stand out, but everything was wonderful. Our server gave informative descriptions of all items we questioned, and gracious warm service throughout.. Sorry I don't know his name but he seemed as though he was the head lunch server. Of the many wonderful restaurant choices on our way to and from Calistoga, we always find ourselves opting to go back to go back to Angele. Reminds us so much of our favorite bistro's in France. Go here for a great meal and great service – you will definitely not be disappointed. ",5
" The meal was really delicious. We started with the escargots. A little different take with the puff pastry and mint, but really well done. We then had the beet salad... simply done, but tasty. Then we had the bone in pork chop that was perfectly cooked and seasoned. Overall a surprisingly great meal with awesome value even when getting a bottle of wine. Will visit again! ",4
 Add me to the totally satisfied list. After reading some of the negative reviews I was very concerned about how dinner would go. From the moment we entered to the end it was excellent. I recommend this place and hope their future reviews reflect our experience last night. ,5
" First time having dinner at Angele.  Ate on the patio beside the Napa River.  Attentive service, great food, good ambiance. ",4
" Great food and great service. Heard about the deep-fried deviled eggs and had to try them. Chef brings a wonderful imagination to the menu, but the result is not ""weird"", just flavorful and interesting!  Will definitely be back. ",5
" Food was ok; service was awful. Asked for bread, did not get it. Asked another waiter &amp; he got bread after a bit of a delay. Brought escargot but no utensil...I had only a dinner fork &amp; knife. Poured a glass of wine &amp; never came back. No one asked if our meal was ok. I spoke with a manager &amp; he said he was sorry...then I told him he had walked by our table about 4 times &amp; never gave us as much as a glance. When we got there, we were one of about 3 couples sitting in our area.  We will not be back. ",2
" Everything was excellent, just the halibut in the bouliiabase was overcooked. ",5
 The menu at Angele is somewhat dated.  It's been several years since I was there and the menu appears to be about the same as it was then.  The prices seem high compared to other restaurants in Napa Valley that provide a better menu and better quality food. ,3
 Very nice restaurant in downtown Napa.  We had dinner outside on their patio with a view to the Napa River and it was very pleasant. ,4
 There must be a change in management as  the  service was horrible. Food was not timed properly. One small plate came out so fast that they brought out a second one when the rest of the food came out.  Eventually management must have realized things were not going well that they kept coming around and Asking how everything  was. Too late. We left a low tip and won't return. ,1
" Authentic French bistro feeling right in Napa. Service was attentive, but not to the point of interfering with the meal. We had the fried deviled eggs, pate and escargot for appetizer, all excellent. For the main course we all chose a different dish; fish, steak, pasta and chicken. All excellent. We have visited this restaurant many times and have never been disappointed with our choices. You can dine inside or outside. It can be breezy outside since it is near the water. Seating inside it tight.  Bon Appetite! ",4
 Great staff and the food was awesome. ,5
 Everything was outstanding---the service was wonderful and the food was delicious...  We will definitely be back!! ,5
" This is a restaurant with consistently good food and service.   The menu has variety of  traditional French food, but also lighter items.  The outdoor patio with a view of the Napa River is wonderful.   You can stroll down the relatively new river walk.  It's is one of my fortieth places in downtown Napa for a combination of food and ambiance. ",5
 Always great!!! ,5
" Angele has great atmosphere, wonderful service and amazing food. We would definitely recommend. We go almost weekly ",5
 Great food and service.  There are lots of choices of small and large plates.  Dishes are very creative and delicious.  It's a little pricey but well worth it. ,5
 Excellent food and excellent service! ,5
" Enjoyed very good cocktails and a nice dinner here.  Request for quiet table was definitely granted as we were seated in a small private alcove away from the happy but noisy main dining and bar areas. Beet salad was mediocre but deviled eggs in small potatoes appetizer was delicious and creative.  Fillet of sole was enjoyed by my husband and my mussels in saffron wine sauce was superb.  Service was friendly and good but food was overly slow coming out leading to long waits.   Overall, a good experience. ",3
 Always the best!  Never have had a ad meal!  The Angele team always right on point!  Thank you!! ,5
 One of my favorite restaurants in Napa.  Always a wonderful experience. ,5
" Food, drinks, and service all excellent.  We sat inside in what looks like an old barn. Very quaint.  Outside seating overlooking the river also available.  My steak was cooked just as I liked it.  The only thing wrong was that the pepper sauce it came with was not on the side as requested but underneath.  However, it was so good I didn't mind! ",5
" Hostess was fine. Wait staff ok.  Oysters fine, no toast.  Deviled eggs so so, perhaps a chef's experiment?  Salad Nicoise disappointed.  The scene was fine, it seemed more like a relais ",3
 Lovely dinner celebrating my birthday. ,5
 We were seated at the bar when we arrived- considered staying there as it is beautiful With lots going on and fun atmosphere. We were moved to a table on the patio where the service was excellent and the food outstanding. Highly recommend the beet salad and the mussels. If I'm ever in Napa again I will be revisiting for sure- well done! ,5
" Went for anniversary dinner. Excellent food, great service. Indoor seating was a little loud w table below the speakers (waiter was accommodating and turned down).  However outdoor tables by the Napa river looked fantastic. Overall very pleased and would recommend. ",5
 Wonderful Sunday Brunch on the patio overlooking the Napa River.  Eggs Benedict was was wonderful.  Mussels were only OK.  Sauce was tasty but mussels very small which meant that some were dry.  Fries were great.  Wonderful dessert menu. ,5
" The menu is extensive and varied, all fresh. The location is adjacent to the Napa river. On a sunny day the setting was beautiful. Our server was attentive to us and pleasant. ",5
 Great food and ambiance as always. One of our favorite restaurants. ,5
" We went to Angele for my best friends birthday.  It was a beautiful day in Napa so we sat outside, which is beautiful, but not over-done.  Our server was attentive, but didn't disturb us if it appeared we were talking.  The food and drinks were all amazing.   We will be eating there more often, even if it's not a special occasion, but because it was a wonderful dining experience. ",5
 Angele's Restaurant was a great find for us while visiting Napa.  Our meals were beautifully prepared and delicious.  Service was attentive and friendly.  Would definately recommend this restaurant. ,4
" Our meal was very good and the waiter was great. Had to ask for the music to be turned down twice, but it was accomplished. Our friends whose reservation was fifteen minutes later, sat next to us, ordered some of the same items, had to wait a long time to be served, and then when their meal arrived, it was not correctly cooked. So sad. ",4
" Always perfect- on every level - food, service and location <strong></strong>* ",5
" Romantic and business? Yes, both. Outdoor overlooking the river is the way to go, though enjoy the coziness of inside dining. ALWAYS have a great meal at Angele ",5
 The drinks were great house made tonic was delicious and some throwback cocktails. Particularly liked the pins cup. The tartare was amazing and the true test of a French restaurant perfectly prepared veal chop! ,5
 This was our favorite meal during our trip to Napa! Such a cute space and wonderful food. Wish I could have tried everything. ,5
" Excellent food, service, and atmosphere.  A wonderful dinner, a fabulous evening! ",5
 This a great restaurant with very innovative cuisine. Have been there several times now and have never been disappointed. ,5
 Always a delight in every way!   We always feel transported to a special place.  The atmosphere and rhythm are decidedly European. ,5
" Very nice experience with friendly, but  spotty service.  The food was very good. Flavorful veal chop and mostly authentic french provincial fare. The only disappointment was the profiteroles which used a pastry tasting more like a biscuit rather than the fresh, light pastry you would find in any french restaurant. Otherwise a perfect venue with great patio heaters and good people watching in the heart of Napa. ",4
 waitress was super chatty and took for ever to take our requests ,4
 We had an enjoyable evening. The owner was very attentive to us and the food was really good. I would definitely recommend Angele. Linda Lally ,5
" We were early for our reservation, asked if we wanted inside or outside. We sat inside, first taken to this little room with 3 tables,  they wanted to seat us at a table for 6, we were only 2.  The room was claustrophobic and echoed terribly.  Seated in main room, noisy but much nicer.  Food was very good, my husband had mussels, the frites were out of this world.  I had the chicken. We also had the fried deviled eggs.  Wine list in my opinion was very expensive.  Corkage was $25.  Our waitress never told us about any specials that day.  Dinner only took us 75 minutes, but we did not feel rushed. ",4
" For a long time, Angele has been our ""go to"" restaurant for special occasions. Unfortunately, on this occasion, my wife's birthday, I was greatly disappointed. So much so, that it has lost its place as that ""go to"" restaurant. I ordered the ""Bavette Steak, French Fries, Sauce Bordelaise."" The steak was the worse cut of meat I have ever been served anywhere. Excellent Bordelaise sauce and French Fries can't make up for a very tough, gristle steak. I would have complained to the waiter and maitre d, but I didn't want to spoil my wife's birthday. ",3
 We had a awesome dinner......steak tartare and oysters were great! ,5
" We stayed 3 nights in Napa and this was, by far, our best experience. The staff were attentive, the food was delicious and the mood was smart yet relaxed. Highly recommended. ",4
 Very nice dining experience.  Good food great atmosphere. ,5
" This has been one of our favorites in downtown Napa for years and it never fails to impress. The food is outstanding, service excellent and ambiance is perfect ",5
 great meal and good atmosphere. walking distance from our B$B that was and important feature. ,5
" Came here for my first night in Napa from NYC and was not disappointed. The food was phenomenal. The dining space was quaint and romantic. The wine list was smart and had some great value. The thing that really made our experience special was the service by Aaron (one of the managers). He greeted us at the door and helped us find the perfect table, checked in on us during the meal, and gave us some great insight into the food. I work in the industry and it was nice to see such a great example of management taking an ""ownership"" attitude while on the floor. It was as if he were our tour guide for the night. Don't skip the muscles or the steak tartare! ",5
 Great service and the food was outstanding. Very good wine list as well that lines up nicely with their food options ,5
" One of my favorite Napa locations. We love to take our boat up the Napa River for lunch or dinner. Always great food. We shared the gazpacho soup and of course the fried deviled eggs - amazing bites. Roasted chicken was perfectly cooked, moist with a little crunch on the outside. ",4
 Beautiful food and a beautiful spot. The service was great also. ,5
 Always a great experience all around! ,5
" We love Angele.  We have been going there since it opened.  The ambiance is lovely , particularly if you sit outside on the patio.  The food is also delicious.  We love the French fries and the croque monsieur. ",5
" On a hot Napa day, it was very pleasant on the patio with a breeze from the Napa River.  We enjoyed everything although I thought the Bloody Mary's needed a kick! ",4
 The bartenders Jason and Ryan really know how to make great drinks ,5
" We were given a gift certificate, therefore we decided to try this place.  Had the halibut and homemade pasta entrees... dry good. The banana dessert was also yummy, esp considering I usually don't care for banana products. We would  recommend this to others for a special occasion. ",5
" Kaylee was wonderful. She was helpful and informative. All of our meals were great, but special kudos go to the duck confit and the bread pudding dessert. Outstanding selection of wines specializing in local Napa Valley wines. All in all, this is a place to which we will return the next time we are in Napa. ",5
 We love the ambience of Angele and chose to eat inside for that reason.  I took my friend for a thank you lunch and we enjoyed the food and wine - just perfect! ,5
" Wonderful. Great ambiance, food and service. Love Angèle ❤️🥂🎄 ",5
" Another wonderful meal at Angéle! Delicious food, excellent service on the beautiful Napa River! ",5
" Let down after many visits. Service was okay as was food. Pushed to the bar to order drinks then seated right next to the bar despite another table coming in after and receiving a good table, away from kitchen view. A table of Somms received all the attention... ",2
 wonderful lunch...sat in back room...food was outstanding. ,4
 I will NEVER buy a mixed drink here again. $14 for a G&amp;T. Beyond outrageous. Jim P. ,3
 Allways love sitting outside at Angele's for lunch.  My favorites are sweetbreads and a glass of Sancerre -- which is very hard to find anywhere else ! ,4
 It was a wonderful meal with excellent service. The food is always delicious and very comforting. ,5
" Excellent French bistro, with classic options like baguettes, escargots, steak tartare, fried deviled eggs, french onion soup, filet of sole meuniere, and just a gourmet hamburger if you are with anyone who does not want weird things. Creative desserts. ",5
" We especially enjoyed nightcaps at the bar. Great bartender. He could make any drink and it was fun to watch him work. Also, the food is excellent. This is our favorite Napa Valley restaurant. ",5
 Great food as always. Wonderful service!! ,5
" Angele is our go-to place for great food and service, and where you can also hear your friends and have a good conversation. It never disappoints, highly recommended! ",5
 There are so many wonderful restaurants in the Napa Valley.  This really is not one of the wonderful ones. I ordered roasted chicken which had a distinct Bar-B-Que taste to it. ,3
" We had a lovely lunch to celebrate a friend's birthday.  Two reasons for the 4 stars vs 5 ... While the servers were attentive, we had to remind them 3 times about the latte my friend ordered.  And I requested a little birthday something for my friend, and was disappointed to have a different server bring out a small dish of ice-cream with a wafer and a candle..and no one sang Happy Birthday and the server served me the ice cream.   Other restaurants usually have a few servers come out and sing... oh  well.  Suggestion .... I think better, more consistent service can be provided if a server is assigned to specific tables instead of having several servers handle all the tables outside.  It was confusing for me, and based not he 2 comments I made earlier, obviously confusing for them. ",4
" We had an amazing time at Angelee. Service was outstanding, food and wine was delicious, music was great and dessert was incredible. We are ready to go back! ",5
" Angele has a great French cafe atmosphere and the cuisine is always delicious.  The music is never intrusive and the noise level also non-intrusive, great for conversations during a wonderful dinner! ",5
 We love this restaurant.  My wife and I go here 3-4 times per year.  I haven’t been disappointed in the 10 years we have been going here. ,5
" If I've said it once, I've said it 1000 times. Angele is the BEST restaurant in Napa. And I've never had to eat my words. When we sit down we know our entire meal is going to be a savory pleasure.    In recent years Angele has upped the ante with vegetables from their own gardens, and our last visit saw a reformatted wine menu and some wonderful new selections.  Each member of the Angele staff, whether bar, service, host... they are all tops and will all take any extra time to help you.  My advice... don't rush... enjoy every bite... come back often. ",5
" Table not ready at our reservation time, then squeezed into a small corner. Entree didn’t arrive for 2 hours, and the food was mediocre. ",2
 Food and service was on point as usual. Love this Napa institution! ,5
 Celebrated my husband’s birthday there and Bettina really spoiled us made our meal super special! ,5
 The waiter was amazing. The food was delicious .  The two made for a perfect night. ,5
 We were celebrating our anniversary. Right after being seated we received 2 glasses of champagne. Nice touch. ,4
" Meal, service and ambience were great. Our waiter, Martin, was fabulous. He shared a heart warming story about he and his wife and kids dealt with the Napa fires... brought tears to our eyes. ",5
" Enjoyed a nice cocktail at the bar before our reservation and were then taken to our outdoor table overlooking the Napa River - lovely ambiance! Food was overall very tasty.  Service was attentive and appropriate for a middle aged couple on a ""date"".  Would dine here again. ",4
" Friendly, knowledgeable servers. Efficient without being overbearing. Food arrived timely and to a perfect temperature. Although the  Onion soup was truly outstanding, ours arrived a bit cool below the lucious cheese.  Perhaps some of the best, create preparations for veal sweetbreads I’ve had.  Portion size more than enough Overall a great evening ",5
 What an amazing dinner!!! We enjoyed every bite!  The service was phenomenal as well.  We can't wait to make a trip back! ,5
" We had a great meal. The tartare, French onion soup was really good. Enjoyed the filet mignon, lentils  and Brussels sprouts. ",5
" We have visited Angele for years and the service gets better and more friendly each time. Great staff this visit, very attentive but not smothering. Food was wonderful. Lovely weather for patio dinner. Nice wine selection. ",5
" My friend and I love tomato soup - we both ordered it as our first course and declared it the best ever!!  Our server, Dan, was as fun/funny as he was professional/knowledgeable- we will definitely request seating in his section whenever we dine at Angele! ",5
 Angele is a GREAT Napa restaurant with fantastic wait staff!  The menu was creative with decent variety. ,3
" Our first time there, was pleasantly surprised. Charming location, indoor and outdoor seating, excellent food, good service. Will definitely be back. ",5
" We had a very nice evening with friends from out of town at Angele's. Three of us had the branzino and it was delicious! For dessert, we had the galette and the flourless chocolate cake... Both were deadly good! Service was very good. Our waitress was there when we needed her and she had a great attitude! ",4
 Great Ambience and service. The food was a bit disappointing. ,3
 A great night out without kids.  Dinner was lovely and the cocktails are amazing.  Really inventive overall and wonderful service. ,4
 The food was excellent as well as the cocktails from Jason and jeff ,5
 Dinner with friends ,5
 Disappointed to say the least - food was so-so compared to when we were there last year - probably won't go back. ,3
" Our two guests had duck breast which was really tough. We did tell two of the personnel but no one apologized or offered any explanation or small compensation   However, our server was very kind about removing a label from a wine bottle in order to provide it to our guest. So that did help a little. Just a little embarrassing when you were hosting overseas guests and to have had them not enjoy their main course at all.  That said  we  would probably go back and give it another try as the place was fun and the people were nice. ",4
 Everything was perfect. Great food and service. Will go again! ,5
 Server Ray was excellent: attentive witout being at all obtrusive. Friendly and helpful service. ,5
" We found Angele when we were in the Napa Valley in 2010 and were determined to return on our next trip to the area.  We did just that on August 21, 2017, and had a very pleasant time.  Everyone found the food quite good although my Steak Frites was not as tasty as the steaks that I find at home in Alabama.  It was a lovely afternoon in a lovely place and just made a perfect finish to a nice day. ",5
" The restaurant was nice and had a pretty decor.   Service wasn't great, but they were very busy.   The appetizers and sides were very good, but our steak came out completely cold.  No one checked on our meal until our steak was almost finished and we had to grab the manager to let her know.  The flavor of the steak was great, but I have never had a high end steak served at room temperature.   It seemed like it was cooked earlier by mistake and just left out on the counter until someone else ordered a steak.   The rest of the meal was great, but when your entree is ruined on your nicest night out, it sort of ruins the overall meal. ",4
" I wish there were more superlatives in my vocabulary! As per their norm, Angele provided us with an exquisite, seasonal meal with delicious nuanced flavors that happily stole the conversation (when we could break ourselves away from our next bite!).   That is perhaps one of the most fun things about eating here; the sheer enjoyment we get from discussing the flavors and sharing wine over them to experiment with pairings.  Angele also offers a number of vegetables from their own organic garden - what a local food treat!  Staff is exceptional; ownership is exceptional; this is the BEST restaurant in Napa. ",5
 Wonderful food and service! We have been many times and we will be back.  Dog friendly too ,5
 Table was ready per our reservation and the food was very good.  We each received a complementory glass of champagne to celebrate our 48th anniversery.  Nice Touch!  A very pleasent experience. ,4
" Everything was wonderful. Waiter could have been a little more attentive, but all in all, it was perfect! ",5
 The deep fried deviled eggs were a great collaboration of fine food and fusion elegance. I've always wondered what French fusion could look like and it was awesome to taste it at Angele! ,5
" Recommended by our B&amp;B owner. Food was outstanding, nice wine selection, and the outdoor dining area was very pleasant. The only negative we experienced was a less than congenial waiter who refused to make eye contact. He was mildly rude and really acted as if he didn't want to be there. My wife and I thought maybe he just didn't like us but as we watched him he was treating guests at his other tables the same. However, his attitude did not detract from an otherwise very nice evening at this excellent restaurant. We would most definitely dine here again when we visit Napa. ",4
 We had our 25th Anniversary dinner here because it is one of our favorite places. I had mentioned that is was our anniversary so we were treated to a champagne toast! Always great food and service ,5
" Creative gourmet selections. French upscale cuisine at its best with moderate prices. Fish, seafood, chicken, beef and vegetarian choices. Great French wine selections. Always eat here when in Napa and recommend it to friends. ",5
 This is one of the 'gems' of the Napa/Sonoma area.. the owner is from a restaurantuer family and she has created a wonderful place with exceptional food and lovely atmosphere. ,5
 Very happy we went and hope to return on our next trip to Napa. ,5
 Great lunch. Wonderful server. Very nice setting right on the river. All good! ,5
 I had heard that Angele was terrific and it was. Three of my favorite 6 foods were in one dish! Cannot say that too many times in life. ,5
" Excellent service, beautiful presentation and food was excellent. I had forgotten just how good this place was. ",5
 2nd visit and both had really stellar service.  All the menu items we had were great. ,5
" Angele is always a win!  Took friends from the east coast and they were blown away.  Wonderful food, atmosphere and view. ",5
 Enjoyed atmosphere very much and enjoyed eating something different from what you can find anywhere else -- enjoyed the French Country atmosphere and food. ,4
" We had a lovely table outdoors, a very friendly and competent waitperson and a nice cool breeze (it was a hot day).  The food was terrific. ",5
 Absolutely enjoy dining here every-time and look forward to our next meal. ,5
" At a lot of French-style restaurants the menu is strange, and you find yourself questioning each item on the menu. Not at Angéle! While a couple of the menu items wouldn't be familiar to the general public, most of the items were modern takes on French dishes. From the wine list to the appetizers to the main courses, each item was wonderful. The service was too-notch, and the scenery was beautiful. If you're ever nearby, check this place out! ",5
" Wonderful patio overlooking Napa river. Patio well screened from street by good landscaping. Food is fresh and very tasty. Staff is efficient and know the menu, and wines to complement the food. ",4
" The owner, Bettina, and her entire staff are dedicated to provide the best and freshest food experience. ",5
" It is too bad the patio is not elevated so you can see the river, but with a tidal river it might not be that much of an improvement. The food was delicious. everyone at out table was really happy with everything. Steak was cooked perfectly as well as the duck and fish. ",4
 Have been here several times and have also referred many of my tour clients there for both lunch and dinner and they always deliver a great meal in a wonderful atmosphere. ,5
 Quality of food poor ,2
 Fantastic food and outstanding service. Worth the hour long drive. We will be back. ,5
 Everything about our lunch was excellent.  We each had the omelet of the day which was delicious and fresh - lovely light salad on the side.  The capucino was the best I've had in a long time.  Love the crockery! ,5
" Great service, great food, great location. ",5
 We always like to come here for brunch before leaving Napa.  Relaxing atmosphere and a great wine list.  Great portions too.  Very french as opposed to American-sized portions... Thank God... ,5
 Rare Napa River view. Great French bistro fare. Excellent waiter Extremely noisy with three  large groups surrounding our table for two. ,4
 Absolutely delicious entrees and small plates. The halibut with artichokes was amazing and the Mac and cheese as good. The atmosphere is cozy and the service first rate ,5
 French inspired.   Great wines with reasonable options. Delicious and creative. Fresh farm to table ingredients. ,5
" We went to three big time restaurants during our visit and this was by far the best. Service, wine knowledge and ambiance made this place the complete package. In Napa you should have higher standards and this place set the bar. Talked to locals and they all knew this place. ",5
 A quintessential favorite of mine. Tonight's mussels &amp; frites w/a fantastic bottle of wine of their curated list was the best yet! Don't miss out dining here if you are in Napa. ,5
" Good food, good service, as always. We loved the foie gras roulade, sweetbreads, cassolet and chicken in puff pastry...all yummy. Lucky to be locals!! ",4
" you walk into a surreal gem.... and you find you can either be a part of the scene or totally alone,  and intimate.............. With the help of the totally professionally staff, the warmth and personal touches of the owner... you know you a not at home... but you and they are in no rush to have you leave. The bar master, the wine lis and the chef.....seem to complement each other ....and your journey is a delight......try everything... ",5
 Food was wonderful.  Crowded.  Waitstaff a bit disjointed ,4
" Angele is one of our favorite restaurants.  We have been there 15 times in the last three months.  It was a nice Friday afternoon and we had a late lunch.  We enjoy the croque monsieur and several of the appetizers.  This particular croque monsieur was produced on a different type of bread that was not as spectacular as usual, but perhaps it was because we were eating at 2PM.  It is a beautiful ambiance and has a well-organized staff.  Their wines are also loverly. ",4
 Salad &amp; Deviled eggs are a must! Awesome location and great ambiance! Lovely decoration! Definitely recommend this restaurant! ,5
" The service was great, starting with the bartender, who was very attentive to my specific martini request. The only complaint all night was the smaller than normal pour in my martini. ",5
 Excellent entrees - sole and chicken pot pie (French style). Excellent service. Great neighborhood authentic French cafe. ,5
" The food and service were outstanding, as always! Our group had chicken pot pie, steak au poivre, fried deviled eggs, escargots and beet salad. ",5
 Perfect! Great service and delicious food. ,5
" Weak service, tiny portions, average food, ridiculous prices.  Too bad there is nothing else within several blocks. ",1
" Chose the restaurant for its ambiance for a special occasion for a friend.  Looked forward to good conversation and a good meal.  All was fine until a noisy group was seated near us and more wine they drank, louder they got.  The music in the restaurant got louder and louder and the style of music was on the energetic side and the mood was unsettling.   Finally we could not continue our conversation, asked the music to be turned down and the staff immediately complied, but the ""neighbors"" were still guffawing and having a loud conversation with each other so we decided to leave and have our dessert elsewhere. Nice restaurant, good food...not quite the lovely evening we were hoping for because of other diners.  Can not fault the staff. ",3
 Engaging waiter with a great personality.  Love the European atmospheres. Dog friendly 😍   Requiring 50 words to pass on a compliment seems a little extreme ,5
" Angele's was a wonderful dining experience.  The food was excellent, the fried deviled eggs were original and tasty, food was well served and the service was excellent. ",5
" I love this restaurant and all the business colleagues and friends I bring to dine, rave about it. ",5
" The food was impeccable, otherwise this would be a 1 or 2 star review...  The service was the worst I have had in years from what would be considered a high end restaurant.  All in all, it was a disturbing experience. Quite frankly, McDonald's till staff comes across as more inviting than Angele's and they left a disturbing taste in our mouths that unfortunately overwhelmed the great taste of the food. ",3
" I have always loved this restaurant.  We had the best service and left all our menu selections up to our server. Surprising, creative, and cant wait to come back!! ",5
" I can't begin to count how many times I've been to this restaurant. Every time my mom comes into town I know this is a 'required' reservation. When I confirm we have the reservation, she always says, ""Oh yay, Angele is my favorite!"" '  As usual, food, staff, service, were all exemplary. Very notable and very well priced wine list.  My only regret is that I don't get here more often! ",5
 Always perfect and very authentic French food...love the decor (also authentically French). ,5
 Excellent Pescatarian restaurant.sophisticated and moderately priced menu; efficient and thoughtful service and  excellent bar offerings.  Big wide windows let you see out on Hells Kitchen!  Must see!! ,5
" Great place; great food from Chef Roberto, amazing barkeep Ryan, pleasant interior design using re-purposed wood, nice customers, etc.. Should be 5 Star except for the front of the house.  But the front of the house is BAD.  First no one at reception, a waiter tries to be helpful after an extended wait, receptionist/manager/owner shows up and criticizes waiter, then ignores us to take care of other guests. When she finally get to us she says ""your table will not be ready until your reservation time"" which 12 minutes later.  She then proceeds to seat other guests at the table she implied was being cleared for us, leaving us at the bar. Which was fortunate as Ryan is first class and made for a most enjoyable evening.    BTW-Our assigned table was finally cleared 25 minutes after our reservation and 37 minutes after we arrived.  Fortunately we were well into our starters.    SAD how one person can mess up what otherwise was a great meal. ",4
 My friends and I were visiting Napa for the first time. This was an excellent place to have a nice dinner. Everything we had tasted fresh and delicious. Fantastic wine list and fairly reasonable priced dishes. Nothing felt heavy or too buttery. Good sized portions too. ,5
" As usual, Angele was fantastic. We haad a cozy table on the patio and had great service from the staff. ",5
" I followed th recommendations online  and had tartare AND frites for the table--this IS more than enough for your meal! The portion sizes were really large. I had the sole meunière afterwards and was SO over full. It was ouR last night in Napa and wanted a special meal, enjoyed the patio / out door meal on their heated patio. Love that people can bring their dogs to the patio. There is a lot of space between tables--great privacy and room for you &amp; your pet. Water bowls provided. ",4
 Angele is one of our favorites when we visit Napa. Pet friendly outdoor dining. Excellent food and service. Lucas B. was our server and did a great job. ,5
 Great green day lunch! Weather outside was perfect. A glass of Sancerre was delicious. And I could not drink a bottle of my favorite Groth sauvignon  blanc because we were also drinking ice tea in an anticipation of a special dinner. ,5
 Been eating here since it opened.  Love it always. Try the burger and the mussels and fries ,5
" Lovely dinner our first night in Napa.  We enjoyed the charming ambience and the window table view of the boardwalk and the Napa River.  It felt like we were in a Paris bistro looking at the Seine - well, almost.  The food was very good.  Mu husband had the beet salad, and I had the French onion soup, which was piping hot and topped with crusty and gooey cheese and bread.  The soup was yummy and hearty, though I would have liked a bit of sherry added.  My husband enjoyed the cassoulet, and I thought my steak poivre was excellent (even though I don't usually care for sirloin strip in restaurants, this one was really good!).  Our server, Greg, did a nice job of making recommendations and checking back with us.  Total bill for 2 glasses of wine, then a small carafe of wine, 1 salad, 1 soup, and 2 entrees was $150, plus tax and tip. ",4
 They do a tremendous job. The food is excellent and the service is good. ,5
" We enjoyed a very pleasant patio lunch, starting with a nice platter of the freshest oysters. The steak tartare and salade Nicoise were equally enjoyable. ",5
 We had reservations and were seated quickly a few minutes after our reservation time. Service was good....a bit rushed.  Food was incredible! The only complaint I have....and I say this about a lot of restaurants....is that the noise level was WAY loud. This is a real turn off for me. ,4
" Service was VERY slow. We had to beckon help and request updates multiple times, and ultimately had to cut things short since we didn't have all freaking day to sit there. ",2
" Great food, but small portions. Limited choices for aps, salads, entrees. ",4
 Food and ambience here are always very good.... the only flaw this time was that we sat at the table for 15-20 minutes before receiving any attention.... later apologized and comped our beverages. ,4
" Angele is a quaint little restaurant with very cute surroundings.  The food, cocktails,  and service were amazing. Our server , Dan, was great and gave us all really good suggestions. We started with the fried deviled eggs.  They were different but very tasty. For entree's we had pasta and a duck cassoulet.  The pasta was very flavorful and a nice size serving. The duck cassoulet was one of the most amazing meals that I have had. I wanted to go back a second night to have it. We will be returning to Angele on our next trip to Napa. ",4
 bad service! bad service! bad service! one more time - bad service! ,3
" We had a reservation for 5:30 and phoned to say that we would be a few minutes late as we were coming from out of town. We were inside by 5:45 and were seated in a tiny back room where two other tables were. The space was almost too small for the three. I didn't mention the isolated location to staff because it was quieter and my husband said that there were only 4 tops in the main dining room. He thought that we would be joined by other people soon. That was not the case.  My Cosmopolitan was sour. Yes, fresh lemon juice but the drink color  ALMOST had a tinge of pink to it. When my husband mentioned that to the waiter he offered to get another. I don't like to complain so I refused. The drink was totally not his fault ans mine for not sending it back.  He was very nice, as were all of the staff.  We had a fantastic bowl of french onion soup and their fried egg appetizer (which was delicious) to start. I had the mussels (with fries) which were the tiniest that I have ever seen!! I seriously had to look hard for them in the large shells. The broth was delicious. My husband had the chicken pot pie. He said that there MIGHT have been 3 ounces of chicken inside. It was small but tasty. Both of our entrees were $28.  The wine $68 (one of their cheapest). Apps $14 each.  For over $200, I was disappointed. Maybe it was us?? We eat out a lot all over the Bay area but this was not one of our best choices. ",3
" Cozy, authentic French restaurant. Excellent service, very good food. My only complaint is that they were sold out of escargot, which is my favorite dish in French restaurants. But it was sunday night, so I can understand. ",4
 Great service! Try and get a table in the back room as the noise is too high elsewhere.  Burlap bag chandelier not pretty. Wine amazing. ,4
 Bread was excellent and my cocktails were outstanding. My husband had the casulet ( very good) the steak was also  very good  but my shortrib Ragout was totally average. Desert was good. We might go back sometime.  Service was spotty ,4
 One of our favorite restaurant in the valley.  We had a fairly new server but she was lovely! ,5
" We dined inside, which has a nice casual / country / french ambience.  Were seated promptly and service was very good and attentive. Wine list is good but on the moderately high side.  Not uncommon in Napa. We brought a bottle of our own pinot &amp; got the $25 corkage fee waived by starting with a very nice half bottle of  Sonoma chardonnay  (I forget the brand).  Pate of the day - a duck / chicken blend wrapped in pastry &amp; service with crunchy brown mustard and a side of lightly dressed greens was excellent. For entrees, my Moules et Frites (mussels with french fries) was excellent, particularly the fries, which were near perfect medium cut, lightly fried and dusted with a bit of salt and parsley flakes. Served wth ketchup and a nice aioli on the side.  On the other hand, my wife's Sole Meurniere was both overcooked and soggy at the same time.  Very disappointing for $30! We finished with a very tasty, albeit rather small, chocolate mousse which featured a delicious crunchy chocolate/coffee wafer on top, and rather weak coffee which was nevertheless served with warmed milk with a bit of foam on top (separate in s small container).  As noted, we very much like the ambience inside when the weather is cooler.  But they have a very nice outside area overlooking the river for warmer days and/or evenings. ",4
" Friendly, efficient service, and carefully prepared food made my birthday dinner very enjoyable.  Only point I noticed was that ""medium-rare"" was cooked a bit too long. ",4
" Disappointed that we were set right next to the bar, practically in the bar!  Very noisy and a lot of server, and bar crowd, traffic! We did book ahead of time. Service was truly lacking. We sat with our dinner plates finished for way to long and finally gave up on the idea of dessert... and had to flag down a bus person to retrieve our check. ",4
" We were very glad to find that Angele is back in the groove with its new chef.  We used to love Angele, but the past few times we'd been there, it had gone way downhill and was quite disappointing.   Fortunately, things seem to have turned around, as our recent dinner of moules frites and cassoulet was spot on -- everything delicious. ",5
" Hi I enjoyed the restaurant and some of the food ordered except for mine the short rib pasta which I found very salty. I may not be a Chef but I can cook and know what is less and too much! Apparently, there was too much sea salt in it and it wasn't appealing to eat at all but I had too! The steak were ordered medium well but turned out to be well done! When we came to the restaurant I thought we had the option of ordering from the original menu and not from the special occasion one.  As far as the pricing goes, I found it very pricey just for the food choices we ate. We should have been offered to make a choice of ordering from the regular menu rather than the special one since the people beside us ordered fries and other food from it. I understand that it was a special occasion but we still should have had the option wether to order from the regular menu or the one on the table. Despite of this, I am still grateful and appreciate your service and hope that my review will help to better your service in the future. ",2
" Always the best, has been for years. I recommend Angele to anyone coming to Napa, or living in Napa. The lovely owner cares about your dining experience and has created a welcoming atmosphere. ",5
" While we always visit Angele's when we are in Napa, this experience was not as good as previous visits.  We felt rushed - plates were removed too quickly, we were in and out in less than 45 minutes on a special occasion evening.  We would return for the quality of the food and the ambience, but we would hope for a more leisurely dining experience. ",3
" I had not been to the restaurant for a while because the food quality in the past has been up and down. Last time I visited was last summer,  the food was excellent and so was the service. Not this time. Overall, at best, a mediocre experience. Generally one can anticipate the experience by the way one is greeted at the door. I arrived 20 minutes before my reservation time and asked to be seated while waiting for my wife to arrive. Many tables were empty (5:10 pm) but I was somewhat rudely told no. When asked why, I was told that they had a busy night and they had to manage the tables. I was forced to go to bar for my drink. All the while watching the tables remain empty. I guess they had to manage empty tables. The experience deteriorated from that point on. The bartender, though a real mechanic, was alone and way too busy. It is not pleasant to be served by a bartender that is visibly dripping sweat. Then the person that rebuffed me at the door came to expedite drinks, scratched her scalp and promptly used the same hand dipping her fingers into the garnish to retrieve lime slices. Gross! Table service was okay, though somewhat amateurish. Food was overpriced and mediocre. $30 for two sole fillets that were overcooked and under seasoned. When leaving the restaurant, the two hostesses/seaters were too busy chatting each other up to make eye contact and greet us good bye. It will be quite a while before I give this restaurant another try. Personnel too amateurish and poorly trained. And the restaurant is way overpriced. Poor value all the way around!! ",2
 The food is always top notch. There is an attentiveness to service that many places lack. ,5
" Always look forward to going to Ange'le. Ambiance and wait staff are terrific. The pate' my wife ordered was perfect. I am a fan of sweetbreads so I had no trouble with a menu choice. They were fried in an oatmeal crust and served on a bed of small mushrooms with a dollop of soft cheese. The mushrooms and cheese were perfect and I really enjoyed them. The sweetbreads, exactly four bites on the plate, were fried hard and had the flavor of Chicken McNuggets but were not as tender. This is a very delicate organ meat that was treated like chicken breast and just didn't hold up. I was very disappointed. We will go back, they are not out on one strike. ",4
" A terrific experience  - food, service, setting. And dog-friendly patio too! ",5
 One of my most favorite places to dine....always lovely and enjoyable. ,5
 Haven't been there for a long time and wanted to try it again.  We will go back enjoyed the meal. ,5
" We had a lovely family lunch, with great service from Dan and the manager, we felt well taken care of. Three of us had the French Onion soup which was exceptional.  We look forward to dining at Angele again very soon. ",4
" Unfortunately this visit to Angele was not terrific. The food was mediocre at best. In fact we sent back one dish because it was not hot or cooked correctly, anything prepared as confit should be falling off the bone and should not have a flaccid raw color or texture to the skin. Shame on them for trying to pass a classic french dish off prepared like that and with a sauce that tasted more of  a barbecue base then a classic french sauce.  Our server was AMAZING though! His talents are being wasted at the restaurant. Sadly what used to be one of our favorites is a place we will not go back to again. ",3
 Service and food were excellent.  One of my guest was 30 minutes late due to traffic accident and the server was wonderful as we drank our wine and waited. Fantastic burger and pommes frites. ,5
 Dan was our waiter and took great care of us from start to finish. One of us had the monkfish and the other two the quail. All were outstanding. ,4
" It's our go to restaurant for the blue note jazz club. Also, we live in Napa ",4
 This is a very good choice for those looking for a nice restaurant in Napa.  Easy access to parking and great location.  Excellent menu and friendly service. ,4
" Was disappointed with the food.  The pate was bland and my Monk fish entree was cold (otherwise it might have quite good).  My friend's gnochi was a tiny serving for a main, and prices overall were too high.  I've loved this restaurant for many years but would go more often if prices were just a little lower...and at any price, they need to up their game on the food. ",3
 We made a reservation and ended up with the best seat in the house!! 5 star service for sure :) ,5
" First visit to this restaurant in some time, as I was visiting Napa for the first time in several years. Both food or service were as I remembered on my previous visit. Food was innovative and exceptional. Had the roasted/pickled cauliflower and veal sweetbreads for appetizers, both of which were excellent and unusual combinations of flavors and textures. Split the monkfish for entree, which was again, well prepared and very tasty. My dining partner does not eat any carbs, so the waitstaff and kitchen accommodated his requests effortlessly. We had done a lot of wine tasting during the day, so appreciated the opportunity to only have a carafe of wine vs. an entire bottle. Will certainly dine there again, if I am in the area. ",5
" Four friends and myself had lunch at a very comfortable round table near the back.  We could easily converse with each other, as we discussed the dishes and got to catch up with each other.  Everyone ordered something different, so between the salads, appetizers, soups, entrees, then desserts, we were able to sample pretty most of the lunch menu offerings.  Every dish was exceptional.  Our waiter was knowledgeable about the foods offered, their composition and was able to provide details about the preparations.  Without alcohol, the bill was about $50 per person for a multi-course lunch, and I feel it was a very good value. ",5
 Great place and high food standards. Love the cozy feel and most times excellent service. Most recent experience slow service. Highly recommend. ,4
 We enjoyed the food and service but as we were there to celebrate a special occasion we found the crowd and noise level challenging. DEFINITELY great for a dinner out but would opt for someplace quieter for special occasions. ,4
" We frequent Angele often and always enjoy the evening. The food is delicious but I rate it lower than I would otherwise because the portions can be quite small. I ordered the monk fish, and it arrived as if cooked on a skewer with small brussel sprouts wedged between a few thumb-sized pieces of fish. The fish was tasty but it didn't have that lobster style flavor the fish is known for. The wine list is very solid in having good Napa Valley and Sonoma picks along with a few French offerings. There was fairly good value in the wines in that I got a 2013 Goldeneye Pinot for $95, which is about a twofold markup. The Bar is cozy for a cold night. ",4
 Consistently good 😊.    Perfect weather for their French Onion Soup. ,4
" Excellent French cuisine, the appetizers were great.  Especially enjoyed the gnocchi and Coq au Vin as entrees ",4
 New Years dinner .  Host and managers were so nice while we waited. Excellent ,5
" Although it was NYs eve, the staff was prepared and calm. Short wait at the bar where the bartender suggested some special cocktails. The place can be a little noisy but the wood and table locations make conversation still possible. Loved the menu and will return again. ",5
" My husband and I have been coming to Angele since it opened, through many chefs, but with the guiding hand of owner Bettina Rouas always steadying the ship (sic), and she has found a winner in the latest chef, Elijah Milligan...We had the chestnut gnocchi with shaved truffles dish that is to die for and the monkfish, which was also over the top...and the chestnut cream dessert, a French classic, and it was over the top...plus the sweetbreads and foie gras for appetizers, not health foods, but it was New Year's Eve after all! Everything was superb! Go treat yourselves...life is short! And we sat at the bar and had a great time with the young bartender who knew everything about each dish...cannot remember his name, but what an addition to the bar! Absolutely our favorite restaurant in the entire Bay Area...cozy, warm, friendly, perfect food, great bar...what more can you want? ",5
" Unfortunately, the music that was playing was not appropriate for this French restaurant. No one loves Michael Jackson more than I do, but his music did not flow with the beautiful, cozy, romantic ambience of a French restaurant, especially Angele.  My suggestions would be perhaps, Contemporary Jazz, (any artist, such as Rick Braun, Brian Culbertson, Richard Elliot, Boney James, Rick Collione, Brian Simpson and Peter White.)  That was my only disappointment, was the dining music. ",5
" If you are a vegetarian and you like options this is not the restaurant for you. I had one choice on each dish, and it was also one of the most expensive choices. The food was good to fair, but not what I would have preferred. We had a gift certificate that we had received from friends which made the meal worth while, but if I had to pay for the entire meal I would have been upset at the selection, quality, and portion size.   As far as a food critique I am no food writer, nor am I any kind of expert, but it seems to me that deep frying cauliflower is a mistake, as it tends to create a slight burnt taste. When you add four different sauces to the plate it also feels a little assaulting and confusing to your palate. The entrée of Gnocchi with mushrooms also felt a little one note. The colors on both plates were not varied, and the gnocchi plate especially had a brown on brown color motive. Two pieces of mushroom mixed with about 12 overcooked gnocchi made the plate a lackluster experience. Desert does not even warrant a comment as it was nothing but sad little financier's that appeared to mixed with some kind of gelatin that ruined any chance at a freshly baked flavor.  The only good part of the entire meal was the server, the ambiance, and the cocktails, but those could not make up for the wasted experience, the two hours spent in the car getting to the restaurant, or the poor new years eve memory that I will carry with me until I get  a decent meal in the near future. ",3
" Very solid, good food. ",4
 My wife and I were in Napa Valley for the N/Y weekend ,5
" Great bistro in downtown Napa. Ambiance is nice and fun. Food is very good. Wine list is decent, but you should bring a nice bottle. We were there two nights in a row with our 7 and 10 year old kids. Service was amazing, they cooked pasta for our kids and gave them crayons to play with. We've been to most restaurants in Napa downtown over the years, and Angele remains a favourite. ",5
" We have eaten at Angele's many times and have always found it to be excellent. This time, however, we went for their Wednesday French prix fixe set menu. It was very disappointing. The menu was unbalanced being very high in carbohydrate and almost no vegetables or fruit. The cassoulet for the main course was so dry that we sent it back. ",2
 Great location in Napa. Food excellent.!! Great French menu. The service was outstanding . Javier was an outstanding waiter.  Made my daughters birthday celebration  very memorable. ,5
 Food tasted fine but I thought it was over all very over priced and I wouldn't go back. ,2
" Excellent, authentic French cuisine with creative twists.  The chef clearly knows what he's doing in the kitchen.  The service was fine and the waiter made some good recommendations.  A most pleasant evening. ",5
" We dined at Angèle the day after Christmas with a party of six.  Because it has been one of our favorite restaurants for years, we looked forward to sharing it with family.  Unfortunately,  we were disappointed with the most recent menu. The appetizers were the highlight.  Of the four we shared, the steak tartar was the favorite.  When it came around to the entrées, instead of having our usual difficult time deciding between all the great choices, there wasn't one dish that stood out.  The combinations were odd.  Can't we have dishes that don't get lost in a ""sea of too many seasonings""?   The desserts were in a similar vein and their garish plating elicited laughter from everyone at the table. On a positive note, we received excellent service from Celeste and enjoyed each other's company.  We may revisit in the spring, but only after we get over this $500 let down. ",3
 Consistently mediocre for food and service; wonderful ambience and closeness to river front. ,2
" We have eaten at Angele four times in three weeks, so obviously we really like it!  This time I had the steak tartare and the grilled dorade.  Very delicious.  The ambiance is lovely in the winter - Cozy, warm and inviting.  Excellent service too. ",5
 Excellent all around ,5
" Awesome, as always! ",4
 Thank you for a lovely Birthday lunch👍 Wonderful service 🌟 ,3
 How did they make the gnocchi so succulent?? Dorade was beautifully prepared as well - fresh and beautifully paired. It's always fun to get the server's insight into the wines and Angele is so great about bringing a taste before you commit to a glass.  All 3 Appetizers were beautiful and desserts served by quick repours of piping hot decaf and a special cookie on the side. Love love love!  Best in Napa! ,5
" Went with a group of 5 for the Wednesday fixed three course French menu... escargot, a Philly style Dungeness crab cake, followed with a chocolate mouse style dessert.. the fixed price of 45$ was certainly a value considering the portions ",3
 Never disappointed!! Our go to restaurant anytime any season! ,5
" Our favorite restaurant.   We love the food, service, ambience!  Always busy, but great for lunch and dinner.  Brunch on weekends, yum! ",5
" The food was delicious and perfectly portioned. Everything tasted very fresh. On top of that, the staff was very attentive. Our server checked in on us frequently as did the manager. Everyone was very friendly and inviting. We would go back again next time we are in the area. ",4
" Great ambiance and delicious food.  The salmon crudo to start was phenomenal!  My fish was excellent and the wine superb - very romantic lighting,etc. Our server could have been more attentive at the beginning of the meal - it took us a while to order our drinks, etc.   Overall a great dinner.  I would return! ",5
 Nice Restaurant with a great outdoor dining set up. Waitstaff was excellent.  Food and service was also very good.  Enjoy! ,5
" Tasty food, nice ambiance on the river at sunset.  Great service, delicious food. ",5
" Napa Valley has an abundance of highly rated restaurants and celebrity chefs.  Angele is one of these.  But what sets Angele apart is the fact that one feels sincerely welcomed by the staff, and the cuisine does not disappoint.  It's easily understandable why it is always recommended by locals. ",5
" I love Angele because everyone finds something on the menu perfect for them! Consistently excellent. I find it appropriate for a date night, friends getting together, or special occasion. ",5
" Hosted visiting relatives to a lovely dinner. Food was delicious and plentiful. Best french fries EVER! Great neighborhood hot spot.  Local or tourist, this is a must visit in Napa. ",4
" Very nice menu, food was delicious, and the service was excellent. I would, however, recommend that they turn down the music volume, as there was a speaker right above our table and it was a nuisance to having it blast in our ears while trying to have an intimate conversation at the table. ",4
 Outstanding food and service.  Will return next time in Napa. ,5
" Very solid Napa Valley eating experience.  My wife had the bone marrow and the duck and was very pleased with the food.  I had the salad and the ribeye and was equally pleased.  Wine selection is good.  Of course, we, like lots of folks, like a restaurant with energy, and this one did not disappoint.  However, the noise level went beyond energy and got to just NOISY.  Put something in place to help with this, please, management.  We couldn’t even hear our very professional and efficient waiter when he spoke.  Further, I know the name implies a French theme, but shouldn’t your “house wine” be a Napa Valley wine as opposed to a $15 (at cost) a bottle ok French wine?  I didn’t have it, and I’m not disrespecting the French wine, but come on – you’re in Napa Valley.  Choose any number of French-like vinyards in Napa and present their wines.  That’s why we’re here! (the tourists) ",3
 we ate outside which was great. Plenty of space. Incredibly attentive waiter.  We shared both courses. Well prepared and very tasty. Enjoyed the evening. Inside was noisy and crowded. ,5
" We had a turbot, My fav fish. IT came in dry and overcooked. The fish as well as the rest of the food tasted allmost nothing. We had a nice Chardonnay with it, but Served in standard small glases. On the positive side is the nice outside dining. But no, I would not go there again. ",2
 We had a wonderful dinner at Angele. The food was excellent and the setting and service excellent. ,5
" The steak tartare was delicious. I had the Turbo for dinner. Great wine selection.  Oh! And don't forget to have one of their cocktails, clear conscious! 😋 ",5
" Always a great experience at Angele. The food and service are always outstanding. It's our favorite Napa restaurant. Brunch, lunch, or dinner, it never disappoints. ",5
" We were pleasantly surprised to find such an outstanding restaurant in downtown Napa.  We were in town for a business conference and had planned on driving to Yountville for lunch, but time did not permit.  This restaurant is every bit as good as the more well known restaurants further up the valley.  We had a wonderful lunch on the patio.  Food, service, ambience - everything was perfectly executed! ",5
" My HH and I had dinner on a Tuesday evening.  We had a choice to dine inside or outside.  We choose outside but the hostess wanted to seat us in a banquette and chair with a small table for 2.  We opted to dine inside which ended up to be a big mistake because as the evening wore on our round seat wood bistro chairs ended up being terribly uncomfortable.  Our cocktails were fine. My HH had the soup special of creamy heirloom tomatoes which ended up being the only good thing we had to eat.  My appetizer of the salmon crudo was tasteless except for the overpowering slices of hot radish. The salmon was not sliced thin enough and it should have been into smaller chucks.  My first taste had no flavor.  My HH had the rabbit meatballs which were OK but the gnocchi was so so.  I ordered the lavender honey glazed duck breast.  It was so tough, my first and only bite was hard to chew.  Also the fat wasn’t rendered ~ yuk. The hostess/manager?? offered me another meal but since it had taken so long to get these entrees and since we were so uncomfortable in the chairs we just couldn’t wait to leave which we did.  She had offered to bring us different chairs or have us move outside but the dining experience was ruined at that point.  So upsetting since there was so many excellent restaurants in Napa and we had to pick this one based on other reviews.  So beware!!!! ",1
" Food was awesome service excellent atmosphere impeccable! Situated on the Napa River Walk with patio dining optional. The Duck breast dinner was very tender and mild duck. The Rabbit Meatballs with roasted carrots and gnocchi was fabulous! The French style gnocchi was the best we have ever eaten, it literally melted in my mouth like it was cream. Yes I highly recommend and yes we will return, by all means possible! ",5
" This place delivered on EVERY front:  food, service, setting, etc. I am only angry that it has taken so long for us to discover this Napa gem. ",5
" Reviews on other platforms generally comment on the great food and mediocre service.  That holds true with my review.  Great food, service was marginal at best, and since it's downtown Napa, somewhat pricey.  My plate of pasta (great pasta mind you) was $32.  Seems a bit high for pasta without meat in it.  Overall, our bill was just over $200, and we only had three entrees (two people split the Turbot), and no alcohol.  The price doesn't matter, as much as the value does.  I didn't see the value, especially when the service is considered.  We were there celebrating the 70th birthdays of our parents, which I included in the reservation notes and told the hostess and waiter.  Generally some sort of acknowledgment would have been made, but nope, not here.  We weren't even offered a dessert menu.  We went for gelato somewhere else. So basically, if you like great food with marginal service, and want to pay about 20% too much for it, well then this is the place for you. ",2
 Excellent as always!  The pomme frites  &amp; foie gras are soooo good!  Loved the cocktails too! ,5
" Great food , great value and beautiful set up by the river. Very talented chef, ",3
" Angele` never disapoints..  I moved to Santa Rosa but will come back anytime to visit and do My friend was very impressed with the service, the food and the outdoor space.. Mant thanks for providing such a charming place and delicous food ",5
 I like this place now. I hear there is a new chef. Everything was wonderful. ,5
 Authentically French and pretty good food.  Beautiful outdoor deck and gracious interior dining room ,4
" Angele used to be a special place...not do much any more. The food is overpriced, the service is only OK and the $20 per bottle corkage is too much for Napa. It's no wonder that the place was half empty Wednesday night at 7:30. ",3
 Came back to angele because of  several positive past experiences. Unfortunately this time was a big disappointment. The menu seemed difficult. Food was just okay. Time to move on. ,3
" We enjoyed the restaurant ambience-lighting was just right as was the space between tables. The food was a bit overrated, however. We loved the homegrown tomatoes. Not so crazy about the entrees as compared with other restaurants in the same price range. Don't bother with dessert-was the worst course of the meal. Meager and pricey! (Also low on taste and eye appeal)! ",3
" We had not eaten at Angele in two years, and wanted to sit an watch the Napa River.  The view was good,  and the restaurant is comfortable.  The salad and appetizers were good.  I ordered the $49.00 rib-eye steak and was extremely disappointed.  Rib-eyes are a fatty cut of meat known for being very flavorable. Unfortunateley, I could not taste the meat due to the bitter and burnt taste of the grill on my steak.  Even the bernaise sauce could not help the strong burnt and bitter taste.  It tasted like the grill had not been cleaned in months. It seemed like I was licking a dirty grill.  I could not eat the steak and they were kind enough to get me another one.  The second steak was a New York cut, and not rib eye.  It also was fried and not grilled.  It was better, and I could taste the meat rather than the strong taste of charred grill. However, it was not what I had ordered, and I questioned a kitchen that would produce such bad food and charge $49.00 for it.  We won't be going back, there are too many great restaurants in Napa to waste time and money here. ",3
" Subpar food for the expectations, a bit pricey for the experience. ",3
 The food was excellent and wait staff friendly and helpful.  The outdoor seating is beautiful! We will visit again! ,5
 We had an issue with the sea bass and without hesitation they replaced it and and provided us with a wonderful appetizer while we waited for the replacement. ,5
" We were visiting Napa for our 40th wedding anniversary and we're looking for a special place.  Angelé did not disappoint, food was delicious and so were the cocktails.  Highly recommend if you are staying in Napa! ",5
" Corner able for 6 was perfect.  Restaurant sits right at the Napa River, but the windows are too small to see it much from inside.  Wait staff was rushed and needed to be flagged down, but food was tasty and well presented. ",5
 Loved the Nicoise Salad. Please bring back the delicious roasted chicken and salad - that was  something I went to Angele to eat on a regular basis. It was healthy and delicious! ,4
 Very limited menu choices ,3
" Everything was well, I had the tartar and it was excellent. The only downfall was the dessert menu. I am a chocolate-o-holic and there wasn't even a chocolate dessert on the menu, so we opted to leave. Great wine by the glass list! ",5
" Lovely setting and competent service, but undistinguished cuisine. Best food is the Acme bread. We've tried this over and over because of the beautiful setting but won't do it again. ",2
 Attended special event called Fried Chicken and Champagne. Found out after we sat down champagne wasn’t actually included. Feel title was misleading. 20% tip automatically charged to check. ,2
" One of my favorite restaurants in Napa Valley. Great food, people, wine list and the best patio dining downtown. ",5
 Very nice French modern dinner. Great list of wine. ,5
" My wife Marianna and I had a wonderful time at the bar, talking with our bar-stool neighbors and the talented and nice bartender Jason.  Great time, great food, great ambience, very accommodating and gracious owner Bettina.  The chef made a wonderful presentation of a duck dish to our neighbors - nice touch!  All in all everything you go out to dinner for. ",5
" Delicious food, a bit expensive but a really beautiful place, great service, great experience ",5
 Excellent in every way.  We have dined there before and it continues to be a favorite. ,5
 The return of the Wednesday night French Dinners is a winter godsend. ,5
" Girls' birthday get together emphasizing excellent food and fun, responsible day drinking.  Fun loving staff made us feel welcome and almost inconspicuous...  huge 👍🏾 ",5
 Our server was such a pro! Excellent recommendations and charm. He's been our server in the past and he is consistently delightful. He's the one w cool rectangle glasses so please tell him hi for me :-) ,5
 Authentic French food beautifully prepared and presented! ,4
" Good overall experience. The room is really nice &amp; they have a great bar to hang out at if your table is not ready. Our main courses did lack a little flavour (rabbit meatballs, whole fish)  but the appetizers were excellent (bone marrow, oysters, salad). I would return and give the main courses another chance. ",4
 This restaurant serves authentic French Bistro food and is a good option for a meal that also has the same atmosphere ,4
" Haven't been back to Angeles for about a year.  On this return, was pleasantly surprised to find that they have kept up with the quality of their food, especially their French Onion Soup and Pumpkin Soup.  I also enjoyed their burger.  The only other observation is that their prices are higher than before.  For the two of us for lunch, with a cocktail, two soups, and two entrees, the bill came out to about $100 w/ tip.  But I would still return because they have maintained the quality of their food. ",5
 Tartare was excellent. ,4
 The Agnoletti pasta dish was fabulous and we also had the Dorade fish dish and enjoyed very much.  We shared the salad dish at the outset and would have liked more salad choices. Great service and food was best quality. ,5
 really great &amp; friendly server. great meal &amp; love the atmosphere. ,5
" Angele is a very French style restaurant.  The food would not appeal to most American children (or adults).  If one is not adventurous, however,  there are always excellent fish, chicken (1) and steak (2) selections.  For foodies, this is a great place in Napa. ",4
 Always a great experience... ,5
" I ate at Angele three times in one week - once for a business lunch, once for a quiet romantic dinner, and once for a lunch with friends.  It is excellent at all times - warm, inviting, with delicious food and excellent service. ",5
" We went to Angele before the Boz Scaggs show at the Uptown - a very easy walk.  Food was delicious and unusual.  Bar is fully stocked and they have an intriguing wine selection.  We went on a friend's recommendation - and we pass that along via this review.  You need to want more than standard American fare, but that's part of the adventure...  Only compliant was sitting close to the front door on a cool evening; wife needed sweater to stay warm. ",4
" Three for a ladies lunch on a rainy Saturday.  We were seated in a small back room which lacked the ambiance of the dining room however the trade off was much less noise.  When we were seated the hostess opened the only window in the room.   Even though it was a tiny window it was 50 degrees outside and we had to get up and close it.  Maybe on a gorgeous day it would have worked better.   I ordered iced tea which was a terrific orange ginger blend and my companions had brewed decaf - served in warm cups with warm cream.  A very nice touch.  We started with tuna crudo which was gorgeously presented.   It was a very large plate with five small pieces of salmon and mini toast points, a few caviar pearls and a molecular dollop of lemon.  Although it was nice I'd go a different route next time and follow the other patrons - French onion soup looked amazing!   Entrees we ordered were mussels and clams, arugula, apple and Brie omelette and Croque Madam.   All thoughtfully prepared to perfection.   The frites that accompanied the mussels were addictive, as was the caramelized onion aioli.   We passed on dessert however from the looks of our neighbors table the pumpkin pot du creme and chocolate mousse were devine.    The staff, including the bus boy, answered menu and preparation questions knowledgeably and without hesitation.  Kudos to good training!!!   We lingered and enjoyed each other's company and found ourselves pressed by the staff on several occasions to vacate our table for waiting patrons.  I would not have hesitated to award five stars had this not been the case. ",4
" Angele is one of our favorite restaurants.  It is warm and welcoming and always has a great ambiance - summer or winter.  The food was excellent, including mussels, French fries, and a great croquet monsieur. ",5
" We have been there before, always a good meal. They change the menu, this one was good but not great. The food was good but not great like we expect. We felt the best part was desert which is not a bad thing, but we left feeling a bit let down. Please don't take this the wrong way. You should definitely go to this restraint. The service is always excellent, friendly and attentive. Maybe just an off day in the back? We love this place and will go back. ",4
 I adore Angele and go every chance I have.  I visit Napa a lot on business and the food and service are just stellar. ,5
 Came here on a date and was impressed. The staff are friendly and attentive. The kitchen cooked a delicious fish entree. Everyone here will ensure you have an amazing meal. ,5
" Angele has been a downtown Napa favorite of mine for many years, however, recent chef changes have dampened its appeal. We began with a truly creative cauliflower appetizer that was followed by lackluster pasta. I do believe they used the wrong flour to make the pasta and thus it was sticky and starchy and unappetizing. The menu also has changed: no more delightful side dishes and gone is the wondrous banana gratin. I won't be returning, too many disappointments for the expense. ",3
" An unexpected parade AND a film festival caused us to be very late for our reservation.  Fortunately, traffic was so heavy I was able to call and let Angele know we were stuck but would still like to have lunch.  They assured me they would be pleased to hold the reservation.  We had the best table, too.  The French onion soup was amazing, rich broth, luscious cheese.  And the french fries the very best I've eaten in years!  The wine recommended was from a Napa winery and truly outstanding. (I am looking for it online now.) My friend and I hadn't seen each other for a year.  We lingered over the wine as we visited and the waiters never hurried us but were kindly attentive. We will definitely return as soon as we can. ",5
 We could bring our dogs and have a fabulous meal. Cudos to them. ,5
" Well, I had hoped for a wonderful evening. To sum it up, they had to comp all of our food. I ordered the duck. When it arrived (after waiting more than 30 minutes after the appetizer), it was ice cold, as were the vegetables. It was as if it was pulled out of the freezer and they tried to get it warm enough to serve. It was inedible. Hard to believe it could be that bad. ",1
 Always the best!!! ,5
" Great wine list, &amp; foie gras was delicious! Staff was very friendly as were the patrons. A must if you are in Napa! ",5
" Angele got a new chef and a new exciting fall menu. After reading the menu, I want to try everything on the menu. We started with cocktails. They were exceptional as usual. My partner and I started with salmon crudo and the mushroom tartine. The salmon was fresh and just melted in your mouth. The earthy mushrooms were just perfect for the cold fall night. For the entrees, we had the rabbit meatballs and the chicken roulade. The meatballs were moist but the herbs were not my cup of tea. The chicken roulade was perfectly cooked, was wrapped by the paper thin crisp bacon. The meat was moist and tasted fresh, definitely a highlight of the meal. For the dessert, we shared the pumpkin pot de cream. The nutty flavor from the pumpkin was well balanced. The cream was topped with marsh mellow. It is a bit too sweet for me but my partner loves it. ",4
" Although the restaurant had overall good reviews on opentable we were all very disappointed. Our waited kept coming at first to see if we wanted to order a bottle of wine before any of us had a chance to see what we wanted to eat.  When he poured the wine for my brother in law to taste he kept looking away as if he was bored waiting for a reaction from my brother in law.  My sister in law had oysters and they were the smallest I had ever seen.  The waiter neglected to describe what the oysters were, which was also disappointing.  None of us cared for our entrees very much as the sauces were either too sweet or too rich.  The ""Muzak"" was too loud and definitely not suitable for what should be a nice restaurant.  Even the busboy was hurried and rude and bumped each of us as he was setting things down or removing them from the table, altogether too brusquely. ",1
" good dining experience. Service was really good. A little bit pricey, but not outrageous.  BEST fries I've had in a long time. Hamburger was good -- very big and thick. Delicious nicoise salad. good chicken salad too. Didn't have room for dessert. Had patio seating. I'd go back. ",4
 Angele has just hired a new chef who is outstanding. Long may he reign. ,4
 Awesome French onion soup ,5
 Our party of four was seated promptly for our scheduled reservation. Our waiter was mostly attentive and our food was brought to the table in a timely manner. A dinner item substitution was accepted. The two fish dinners were each served as a whole fish which was a bit of a surprise but worked out OK. I had the rabbit meatballs. I had no idea what to expect and was pleased with the result. I would have it again. There was some confusion when dessert was ordered and served but did get straightened out. My coffee was never refilled. It was a good but not great Napa dining experience. ,4
 The new chef Elijah is absolutely out of this world. Very much worth a special trip.  The menu is now back to it's French roots. Cudos to owner Bettina Roujas. ,5
 It was a great dinner. Best in town. ,5
" Thouroughly enjoyed our Rabbit meatballs, roasted brussell sprouts and 2 delious deserts.  Great place. ",5
 Think we just were there on a bad night as it came highly recommended. Cauliflower app is amazing. ,3
" Lovely setting along the Napa riverfront. We dined on the patio, facing out towards the river. It was a Sunday and they didn't have traditional brunch fare but they did serve omelette and quiche with salad. Very French. ",5
" Disappointing for a restaurant with such a great location and one that is highly recommended.  Service was spotty, orders messed up, food good but not high end.  Overrated place I'd say. ",3
 Great craft cocktails and the rabbit gnocchi bolognese was amazing. ,4
" While the food was good, a few things were off. The Housemade Ricotta, Summer Fruit Marmalade, Toasted Country Bread was a pot of ricotta topped with fruit that was much more like a fruit butter than a marmalade. Tasted like quince or pear or apple (thick, dry, grainy texture and pale golden color) although the waiter said it was apricot (no way could it have been apricot). By definition, don't all marmalades have at least a bit of citrus? Otherwise, they'd just be jam. That being said, the dish was delicious. The pot of ricotta was a very generous but there were only five little 2-bite toast rounds served with it. We had to ask for more bread, twice, to finish the cheese. Seems odd to get it wrong on such a simple facet of the dish. Also, our waiter wasn't on his game. After he introduced himself and told us about the specials, my friend ordered a ginger beer but the waiter didn't ask me if he could get me anything to drink. Nor did he ask when he delivered the ginger beer. Nor did he ask if we were ready to order. He just went on to other tables. Took him quite a while to get back to us. I finally moved the menus to the far corner of the table because I kept thinking that he must think we weren't ready yet.  It was very weird. Nice atmosphere but sadly the view of the Napa River is not a pretty one. At least not on that day. I will go back but they do need to work on some things. ",3
 A beautiful location and terrific food served indoors or outside by the river. guests sit under sun shading umbrellas and feel the perfect Napa air. ,5
" delightful ambiance along the Napa river.  Charming interior, pleasant outdoor dining.  Great food, great service. ",4
" We have eaten here many times over the years.  It is a favorite, and there are many items on the menu that we love.  They also have a very nice wine list, and it is a lovely spot to eat.  I hear they have a new chef, and I look forward to going back and seeing what changes the new chef makes.  Our only consistent problem is the service - it is always erratic and uneven, and this time was no exception.  The server was there, and then she would disappear causing us to have to flag down someone else to get something after a long wait.  When the dishes came that we ordered, no one knew who had ordered what, and we had to tell them.  At a restaurant at this level, we should not need to tell them who ordered what.  I would love this place so much more if the service improved. ",4
 The food was very tasty and had ascetic presentation without being pretentious. ,4
" Everything was great, except for the waiter who seemed to try to be turning the table as soon as he could.  Trying to pick up dishes before all was done.  It was early and their were plenty of table available, no need to rush customers.  Having said that everything else was great, will go back again and again. ",5
" Angele was our splurge dinner on our trip to Napa. We loved the French ambiance of the place and my rabbit gnocchi was special. However, my wife's chicken was very mediocre, and we actually disliked the pork belly fritters (the fish sauce did not make sense to us wit the dish). ",4
" The food was OK, Nicely presented and the service was good. The prices seem high for the quality of food but this is Napa and you expect that. ",4
" With so many great restaurants in and around Napa, the bar is very high.  Angele is superior to most Napa restaurants and highly recommended.  Service was excellent.  Menu very interesting in a good way...variation and quality are notable.  Don't hesitate for a moment to dine at Angele...special occasions or dinner date. ",5
 Service was excellent (as usual). Food was amazing (always is).  This is a gem and they are consistent. ,5
 Chef is amazing.  Food to die for.  Our server was on top of her game.  Chef better get his  Michlien Star this year!! ,5
 A bit on the expensive side for what it is. Nice outside seating. ,4
 one of our favorite places to dine.  Great food and great service. ,4
" Food was way over priced for the portions. Service was good, but menu was limited to VERY expensive entrees. Dissapointing. ",2
" One of our absolute favorite restaurants.  I could live on the deep fried deviled eggs!  We love dining out on the patio with views of the river.  The staff here is professional, friendly and engaging.   The menu has a lot of different and varied options and they change seasonally. ",5
" It was our anniversary. Our waitress was perfect! She suggested a wine and then came back to suggest a better wine for our food pairing. Couldn't have been happier with the service, food or ambiance. ",5
" Angele is an incredible gastronomical find in Napa.  A wonderful location on the Napa River tucked await the end of Main Street, it is a must for brunch and dinner. Great wines to compliment any meal and a full bar service too. ",5
" Angele has a really nice large patio along the river and the tables are spaced far enough apart that you can enjoy conversation, so it's a great place to go with friends (so many places where you can barely hear each other and/or you hear absolutely everything from the tables around you).  We're local so have been many times and the food is always good and occasionally excellent.  Usually the service is pretty good, but on our most recent visit, it was decidedly less than stellar ... our waiter kept disappearing and I finally had to get up from the table to ask for more water, plus he mixed up the orders and though polite, was hardly friendly and barely made eye contact. ",4
 This was my first visit to Napa's River Front. I was impressed by the entire area with shops and restaurants along the river. Angele was a delightful place to eat. It is a place that prides itself on the quality of their food and wines. I am a person who prefers quality over quantity. I prefer a light meal. The waitresses were very  attentive and took our picture as we left. My girlfriend is a friend from second grade and we are now 66. ,5
" Our experience was the worst we ever had.  The management was horrible.  The food was fine but they completely messed up our reservation and one that I had made weeks before. I was clear on the number, that we had a dog ( as dozens of people do at this establishment) and that we would be a larger party (11 then reduced to 9).   they had offered to give us two tables on the terrace which I had indicated would be ok.   Bringing a well behaved pet onto the terrace has always been welcome hence our reservation and terrace request.  There was more than one group of 6 or more on the terrace that afternoon but they were in no way prepared for our noon reservation and admitted they had messed up. They were totally overwhelmed with reservations that day and ours was the one shuffled to a  back room, that was loud, to hot and with a tiny window and they acted as though they did us a favor by allowing us and our dog to dine there, after I had made a reservation for Father's Day well in advance.  Our bill was nearly $500 dollars and the 20% gratuity built in which I expected and the waiter was very nice.  they didn't offer us a drink, an appetizer or dessert, nothing to make up for their poor management.    We have eaten there for years and we will NEVER GO BACK AGAIN and I will tell all our friends who frequent the area.  I wouldn't waste my time sending a private note to the restaurant.  I was polite  as i could be and I am not the type of person to complain but  I and my  family members, all from outside the area were horribly disappointed. ",1
 Beautiful patio....wonderful service for Father's Day brunch! ,5
 Food quite good service not so much Seemed to be a lot of staff but not much attention.  Table next to ours got appetizers after main course.  We almost died of thirst waiting for water refill ,2
" Perfect Every Time!  Wonderful patio dining outside, quaint and welcoming atmosphere inside.  Suitable either for a casual dinner or a special occasion.  Food is delicious, best ingredients, perfectly prepared and presented.  Very good wine list with reasonable prices.  Creative cocktails and a good selection of wines by the glass.  Staff is very professional, friendly, and makes everyone feel welcome.   Angele is not only excellent but also very consistent, we've been regulars for 8 year and have never been disappointed once. ",5
" The menu was great and the food was absolutely delicious. We enjoyed our meal immensely. The service, however, was not good as we expected. ",3
 Wonderful relaxed experience with great food ,5
 Appetizers were wonderful as were the main courses. ,4
" Angele is an enjoyable restaurant and a local favorite.  The ambiance is the reason people go. Food quality varies from good to excellent.  Hamburgers are among the best around.  I might note that the pricing of the food is irregular and sometimes steep, as small plates are sometimes priced like main courses, and side dishes may be overpriced.  Here, a small lemon tart/pie slice  is priced at $10.00, while other restaurants would price this at $6-8.  So order carefully! ",4
" Great location, nice lunch menu, friendly staff. ",5
" Great service, great food. The music did not fit at all...it was mariachi music at a French restaurant...weird. That is my only criticism. ",5
" Shared the steak - just not very ""special""...ordinary food this time. A little disappointed - but loved sitting outside and service was great . ",4
 Fantastic food and service ,5
 Fantastic spot ...so good we went two nights in a row and took friends second night!!! ,5
 I found the entire dinner to be boring and uninspired.  The restaurant seems to lean too heavily on its Napa address and riverfront location creating a bland menu and average food. The one thing they do really well is charge high prices for average offerings.  There are some many other great choices in the area that I don't plan on returning any time soon. ,3
 The wait staff were excellent and quite helpful as well as being completely supportive and always paying attention to ensure our comfort and pleasure.  The food was consistently excellent. The lobster pot pie was superb. ,4
 The service was great. I ordered the Niçoise salad and the tuna was canned. I was surprised and and not thrilled the server and manager insisted I get something else that would make me happier.   The food was great and the service superb. Great wine list and a wonderful setting. ,5
" Angele used to be a good, casual choice for us when we visit Napa.  The food is still  good but can be inconsistent and so is the service.  The hostess can be very attentive one day and kind of harried and too preoccupied on another.  The indoors dining room can get noisy because it's a small-ish room with a bar running along the one side of the space and music at somewhat high volume.  I love the art on the walls and the dining room decor overall.  The outdoor area is a bit blah, you almost feel that you are sitting out on the parking lot and it needs more decor, maybe a few more planters?  People come wandering into the space from the parking lot, check out the menu and wander off again.  You feel sort of exposed.  The last time we were there, I thought that the food had become way too expensive for what it is.   Sometimes we used to go there just because you can always get a reservation at relatively short notice. ",2
 The Sevice was great. The servers were vert attentive. The food was good. I have the gnocchi with rabbit. Shush was very good and the right size portion. ,4
 Everyone enjoyed their meals and I LOVE when there are starters on a brunch menu.  The housemade ricotta and jam starter was the best!  Eggs Benny seemed to be a hit and I loved my Croque-Madame.  Wine list was phenom.  Great meal. ,5
" Always our most favorite spot! For friends, relatives and romance alike.  Top notch service, always the most elegant offerings with seasonal menu tailoring.  Our favorite in Napa and it always exceeds our expectations! ",5
" Maybe we picked an off day, maybe the new chef needs a bit more time. We are locals and have eaten at Angele many, many times over the years. But our last meal there did not match earlier experiences. It was half an hour past our reservation time until we received our first course, a cheese plate. We needed to ask 3 times for water. The cheese selections (Brie, Bleu, and Gouda) were all ordinary tasting, not really knock-outs, but the figs were excellent. My chicken salad was fine, not great. I like the included egg, but the ham not so much. It seemed to clash with the other ingredients. My husband's salmon ravioli was described as having gem lettuce on top. Instead, it was more like creamed corn. The salmon taste was lost. I did not care for it, but my husband did and gave it a B+. The service was slow but friendly.  We'll give the chef more time and try again. ",3
" One of our regulars in Napa, but the food and some of the staff were not on the top of their game this particular day. ",3
 It was a very nice evening.  The food was good and the portions were reasonable.  Our waiter was exceptional. It was recommended to us and we will recommend it to others. ,5
 New Chefs menu is great.  The food is as light as it was before.  Fantastic experience and will definitely come back again. ,5
" Angèle Restaurant &amp; Bar never disappoints.  They are creative without being pretentious.  They use fresh seasonal fruits and vegetables.  The appetizers are great and fun to share.  The entrees are a good size.  I'd be happy to eat there everything we go up to Napa.  Lately we've been disappointed with some of the more recognizable popular named restaurants where the menus have gotten a little too froo froo, and the service has declined.   The outside patio with the heaters is wonderful. ",5
" Our meal was okay, but I have to say, the poached eggs on the chicken confit salad were very, very slimy...yolk over cooked  white undercooked and unappetizing.  They basically ruined the meal for three of us. In the past I have enjoyed the Salad Lyonnaise, similar the the confit, but the poached egg on this salad was scrumptious ! Please advise the chef. We dined on Saturday August 20. ",3
" The food was delicious and it was a great location.  Only thing I wish was that there were more options available for lunch.  I loved my cheeseburger and bone marrow, but I wished there was a fish entree or pasta entree. ",5
" It is impossible for my wife and I to eat a full meal so we always split. I always tip extra because I feel we are cheating the wait staff by ordering so little.  The waiter spent way more time with other tables barely stopping at ours.  We ordered a rib eye, medium well. The steak came medium rare. We sent it back and it was returned lightly burned on the outside and still medium rare.  At this point we gave up, it was being cooked on a too hot pan and no way we're they going to get it right.  We have eaten here several times over the last 5 years and always had a good experience. Not sure I want to go back, but if I do I won't order steak. ",2
 Beautiful ambiance &amp; restaurant.  Amazing food. ,5
" Service was off the Sunday night we were there.  Very slow, had to ask for things.  That is not usually the case - so assuming it was an off night.   We love this place and come here often. ",4
 Great long lunch with several courses and the really took excellent care of us. ,5
" Very much enjoy Angèle but the weak point is often the service.  Four to five stars for location, food and ambiance - but a lukewarm two for service.  As a local, I've visited a number of times before and by luck of the draw at times had a great server, but the last two times our waiter was unenthused and conspicuously absent.  The couple at the table just behind us had the same experience -- I caught them looking around for him at times to no avail.    Angèle is certainly a good restaurant but needs more consistent and efficient service to be great. ",3
" My wife and I went here for brunch during a Napa trip to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We arrived at 11:30 AM and were the first customers of the day. We were seated on the patio near the walkway overlooking the river. Our server was friendly and professional. My wife had sparkling wine and I had a mimosa, both of which were excellent. The orange juice in the mimosa was fresh squeezed. The bread that was brought out next was light, crusty, and oven fresh. Our entrees were the quiche and croque madame. Both came with a small garden salad (with just the right amount of delicious dressing) on the same plate. Both dishes were perfectly flavorful and expertly prepared and presented. Try them, you'll like them! Everything was made with the freshest ingredients. This was one of the best meals we had in Napa. ",5
 Had a drink at the bar because we arrived early- great friendly service. Learned we would be experiencing a brand new chef. Our dinner and our waiter were both perfect! Thank you ,5
" We absolutely loved the food, drinks, ambience, and service at Angele!  The outdoor patio is so lovely on a nice day!  The cocktails were expertly prepared, the Diane Lane was so refreshing with its balance of pomegranate and rosemary elevated with vodka.  The wine list was lovely and the seasonal cuisine was spectacular!  Try some of the truffle-kissed dishes with French-California flair!  We will definitely be back! ",5
" The food was good but some items were way over priced.  Enjoyed the outside dinning.  There were four in our group, two thought the food was very good, and two weren't happy with their meal. ",3
" I've been to this restaurant many times. That's why I introduced it to some new friends. I was so disappointed. We waited an 1.5 hours for our meal. Asked our server about the delay twice. It was absurd. Very poor service, no apologies, no make up dessert. The fries are still awesome. ",2
" We have eaten here many times and the food is always excellent. This time, while the dinner was very nice, we were just a bit bored by the offered menu. Nothing wrong, just not exciting that night. ",4
" Terrific meal, wonderful waitstaff that gave excellent recommendations. Would definitely return. ",5
 I love how you can bring your dog and dine outside.  Service was great too! ,4
 Cool menu with items like fried devil's egg. The pot au feu was tasty. The roasted branzino was amazing. Devoured the chamomile pot de creme. Definitely a restaurant I would go back to. ,5
" I should have realized it was a bad sign when the restaurant requested a credit card to guarantee the reservation for 5 diners made thru Open Table.   After driving 45 miles, one of the first things noted on the menu was that large groups(4 or more) were assessed a mandatory 20% tip.  This was bad sign #2.  We waited patiently for our server, who eventually sauntered over but did not speak.  One of our party had to ask him if there was something he'd like to say.  He left &amp; didn't return for another 5 mins(bad sign #3).  We were eventually able to order appetisers(which were tasty) &amp; our entrees(which were terrible).  Three of the entrees had to be returned because the were served raw(bad sign #4).  These meat entrees were tough &amp; not provided by a first tier butcher(bad sign #5).  Dessert &amp; coffee were ordered, but lackluster.  The bill lacked no luster, &amp; combined with the (no choice) tip, HUGH.  There were no apologies offered for the uncooked entrees or poor service.  In fact, no one bothered to ask us for any feedback at all(bad sign #6).  This was a high tech hold-up taking advantage of 5 Open Table customers.  Our last word:  this is a tourist trap undeserving of of listing in OT.  Next time we'll go to In-N-Out, honest fare at an honest price. ",1
 Everything was fine and as expected; just a little disappointed with the quality of the steak. ,4
 I usually have lunch here. The burger is delicious. Dinner however was dissapointing. Small piece of Halibut was ok but given there are so many excellent restaurants in Napa I probably won't be back for dinner. ,3
" Everything was good except a few kitchen based problems.   The $49 steak was thin and overlooked, upon asking for MR. They fixed it but with a super marbled steak that was more fat that meat.    Pasta was amazing.  Apps were amazing.  Bronzino was tasty but with a couple bones.  Atmosphere was terrific.   Service was great. ",4
" Always my go-to restaurant in downtown Napa. If the weather is nice, always ask for outdoor seating. ",5
" This restaurant is always dependably good, and professionally managed... The staff are friendly and efficient, well trained and one feels ""this is the right spot"" as soon as you are seated!  The menu is seasonable, and never disappoints, and  on this visit we left feeling very well fed and taken care of. Definitely our  ""go to"" restaurant  for all the above comments! ",5
" Love it.  Sweetbreads were a 5+, pork belly a 3.  Great setting outside for lunch ",5
 Food and service was excellent.  Brought friends there for the first time and all gave it a thumbs up and A+.  Will return often. ,5
 Great patio. Had the mussels which were in a great sauce but felt they were small and overpriced compared to others in the area ,4
" We were disappointed in the food and beverage quality.  My first choice of beverage was sold out. The appetizer (fresh cucumbers, tomatoes and burrata) was excellent! The salad entrees and dessert were just ok, very American versions of French cuisine. The outdoor dining was nice and the servers were very attentive. ",4
" My husband and I visited on the occasion of my birthday. We hadn't been for over a year and we were so pleased! My cassoulet was delicious! The wait staff was efficient without being fussy. My before dinner drink was exceptional. My only ""not so happy"" was being sat next to a dog owner who was also sat next to a dog owner whose dog piddled on the cement during dinner. Sorry, it's not France, and I don't appreciate pets at the dinner table. Perhaps in the future, the hostess could ask if we had a preference for dog zone or not. Otherwise perfect in every way. Great way to spend a big birthday. Thank you. ",5
" I've been a regular at Angele for many years and used to find it reliably good.  Unfortunately the last 2-3 dinners there the service has been noticeably poor and rather indifferent.  The food is passable, but also not up to the quality of past years.  I will not be back until I hear that someone in charge is paying attention again. ",3
 I was missing the fois gras. May be it wasn't the season. ,4
" We were there to celebrate the French holiday, July 14th.  We felt like we had a lunch in a French cafe!  All good! ",5
 Great food and wine in a wonderful outdoor dining area.  The service was excellent and our server was very helpful with wine selections.  We would definitely revisit! ,5
" Angele is probably the most professionally operated restaurant in the Napa Valley.  The hands-on management knows the formula in pleasing its customers which is one of the reasons why it has become so popular with local valley and Bay Area residents.  It continues to have a very loyal following and for good reason:  one is rarely, if ever, disappointed with the dining experience at Angele. ",5
 Great place in Napa for an outside table lunch. Prefer that to their inside . Great salads and varied wine by glass choices. Try salad nicoise or their croque msr. Sandwich. ,5
" We have been dining at Angele ever since they first opened.  We keep going back because it is consistently comfortable, the service is great, and the food is very good.  I love the outdoor patio.  It is one of my favorite restaurants in the area. ",5
" EVERY item on the menu is a culinary delight. We started with the hamachi crudo and enjoyed the steak tartare, as well. The duck and the branzino were both delicious entrees. We finished with the strawberry tart and fresh ice cream. Bubbles paired nicely throughout the meal. Service was great, too.  We were attended to perfectly. Great all around evening! ",5
" A great French restaurant on the Napa River in downtown Napa, CA.Previous experience is a great lunch so we went for dinner.  All good, but very noisy, which seems to be a current trend for a lot of restaurants. ",3
 Sundays.  with Friends and Martinis. at Angele have been routine for us.  We have always have a relaxing time. Great food always fantastic service.  Many of the team seems to have been there quite a while and always set the perfect tone for the table.     Steak  Tartar and a Martini and a few friends  at  Angele equals a perfect  Sunday afternoon. ,5
" When taking guests to a new place, we want to be sure it is a comfortable spot, with great food and this restaurant never fails, and last Saturday was the perfect choice. We can hear ourselves talking, here, and with a  professional wait staff, and punctual on reservations..  Whats not to love here? ",4
 Angele's wonderful French-inspired menu blends seamlessly with its picturesque setting on the Napa River. One could almost imagine themselves on the Seine enjoying a leisurely lunch. I love their food and I always look forward to each and every meal there. Can't wait for a return! ,4
" My husband and I had lunch at Angele restaurant and it was lovely. We had never eaten there before and I enjoy French food. The service, food and ambiance were great. The only thing I was disappointed with was my Beef Bourgogne. The flavor was delicious but I always knew it as a stew with this delicious sauce instead of a piece of meat with sauce over it. I probably should have asked before I ordered. Other than that it was fine. ",3
" We have always had a tasty meal at Angele, almost all entrees, but the service is real poor. They charge $25 for wine corkage and only pour you once initially then you never see them again. Service is rushed, they want to move you in and out. ",3
" Angele is located in the Napa River Inn complex.  It is river-side with views of the water from the dining room and an outside patio area. The restaurant describes its food as French country fare and the menu changes with the seasons. We were here for our adult daughter’s birthday and we ate very leisurely, had a number of appetizers and tapas, took a while to decide on our choices, and virtually closed the place down.  But the servers were very gracious, were patient, and never rushed us.  The food was excellent.  Our choices included, among others, the Coq au Vin, veal loin, foie gras and duck liver terrine, fried black truffle eggs, and profiteroles.  All were excellent.  Parking lots are available.  We hope to return soon. ",5
 Enjoyed our evening here and food was excellent. Friendly waiter. Rather cold room as doors wide open and it gets cold in the evening. Maybe trying to get rid of those still there at 8.30 as seemed very busy at 7.30 but most people leaving soon after. ,4
" Service was excellent, food was wonderful (everyone in our party of 6 enjoyed their dinner).  We had a wonderful day up valley and decided to try a french (cab franc) and while it did not meet up to its Napa competition it was still very good . . . my vodka martini was excellent.  The best Cab Franc I have had in Napa is produced under the label ""Trespass"" in St. Helena.   Thank you Betina, we are never disappointed! ",5
" Our server was lovely. The restaurant is BEAUTIFUL. I want to live there! The art is stunning. The petrale sole was delicious, but the show stopper was your special of the day- a bolognese pasta dish. Our friends said they liked their madame croquette's but they were a little dry- not enough of the sauce it was advertised to have.   I also enjoyed your wine list. A perfect mix of local and french wines, nicely priced and fun to have them available by the glass. Thank you for a great lunch! ",5
" Great food as always, celebrating my birthday with a friend. ",5
" Dined here 3 times so far, every time is great. Not too stuffy or fancy, but the focus is on amazing, interesting cuisine and a great wine list. Nice outdoor dining area along the river as well. ",4
 Great romantically rustic ambiance by the water.  Small portions for the price.  My duck confit was tasty but my dining partner's coq au vin gave him the runs.  The apple bread pudding was more like apple crumble and not bread pudding.  The carafe of house red wine was tasty and enough for four small glasses.  Service was very attentive and unobtrusive. ,3
" This is our favorite go to place where we know we can have a great meal, relax and feel spoiled. We have been coming to Angele for years and the quality and service has never waivered  (Honestly).  It's an all occasion,special spot.  I highly recommend you treat yourself and enjoy Angele! ",5
 Food was great service was just ok.  Love the setting! ,4
" Typical of French restaurants, not vegetarian friendly; I visited on Valentine's Day, so the menu for fish was for 2 only.  I had 2 appetizers which were overpriced and bland.  My friends made better choices .Terrific ambiance and lovely location on the river, including great outdoor seating.   Service was terrificPlease consider vegetarians and pescetarians on your menu.  There are a lot of us! ",3
" The setting was relaxed and calm with a view of the sunset.  For as busy as the outside area was, it was quiet on the patio.  My only complaint, the Lobster Pot Pie was more like a soup than a pie. ",4
" A weekend is all we had on our first trip to Napa Valley. So we decided to use our guidebooks top ten list of best places to eat in Napa Valley to choose a spot.  Angeles was actually last on our list to call and...bingo we scored a five o'clock reservation.   Since we were so early we had our choice of seating, so we chose the patio which was picture perfect, reminiscent of eating in a Italian plaza.   We were happy as clams, however, it went a bit downhill from there. The first let down was the limited wine list. Funny how there was only one red french wine in this supposedly French restaurant.   The second let down was the almost surly waiter, who I'm sure, would've been surly if he had any personality at all.  The second let down was the strange combination of Italian and california cuisine, wirh  a latin sprinkle, in again, this supposedly French Country restaurant. One or two dishes at the most, were at best, French influenced.  Wirh so many choices in this area, we will likely not go back soon. ",2
" The menu was surprisingly unadventurous.  Only one fish entrée, and it was for two, so not an option if only one person was interested in fish.  The chicken was very plain, and the truffle risotto, though tasty, was such a small portion that it was more like a starter instead of a main course.  We had the beet salad to begin, which again was so small that the price was just not justified, though the flavor was fine.  There was a very noisy table next to us, so difficult to have a conversation.  The service was average throughout the meal, and it took a very long time to get change from paying our bill (I think they wanted us to  just leave as it would have provided the server with a 30% gratuity). There are many great places to eat in the area (we have a second home in Yountville, so are often in the Valley for both work and pleasure), and we would not return to Angele nor recommend. ",2
" I have to take back my previous poor review of the this restaurant!  My last visit was absolutely amazing and changed my opinion completely! The food was perfect, delicious, beautifully presented with amazing ingredients. The service was spot on.  Bone marrow small but great taste Steak Tartare was terrific and full of flavor, very fresh. Foie gras was amazing, paired with the perfect fruit We will be back very soon - looking forward to another great experience. ",5
" Menu options are limited. There are five entree choices, narrowed down to only one if you're gluten free. The portion sizes are very small and the prices high.  We sat outside on the patio and the setting near the river was the highlight. Our waitress was friendly. I would not recommend this restaurant. ",2
" Great place! The Union soup is to die for, Wines are moderatly priced. Can understand why this place has many good reviews. Well deserved! ",4
" We called to change the time 30 mins later from 7 to 730 and the girl who answered the phone I believe Kate was very rude, stated she wasn't sure if she could or couldn't accommodate us?! She could've just said there may be a little wait but no she was rude and said she wasn't sure how long etc., we decided to go after debating for awhile. The food was amazing and customer service once we arrived with our servers  was great as well. The hostess must've been who was rude as she wasn't very friendly at the restaurant as well. ",4
 Beautiful food in a lovely setting.  The service was excellent ,5
" The sweet breads were perfectly cooked, fresh and clean tasting, though the portion was more like an appetizer size.  My friend had the salad with tuna.  The salad was fresh and large but unfortunately, the tuna looked and tasted canned and not even fresh at that.  The next table had the muscles and they looked plump and juicy, not overcooked as they so often are in restaurants.  I'd go back and try a few more dishes... I'm sure with experimentation I would find more great food like the sweet breads. ",4
" I was new in town a year ago, and a friend introduced me.  It remains my favorite spot.  Beautiful location, not pretentious, wait staff always charming, food dependably good.  I take guests for birthdays, gatherings, and galpal lunches. ",5
" Onion soup needed a bit more intensity, lobster in pot pie overcooked and tough, chicken coq a vin was dry without one mushroom in it and lardons were hard as a rock. Risotto was not cooked properly and one diner could not cut potato slices on branzino as they were as hard as cement. We (3 diners) did not want to take a chance on a bad dessert so we left and had dessert and coffee elsewhere. Since reviews were so high perhaps this was an off night but at the prices, we will not gamble on a second visit. ",2
 Great staff and excellent food!  We had an excellent time!!  We felt welcomed and attended to the whole time. ,5
" Fresh, delicious and innovative.  The truffled ricotta pudding is unforgettable.  We also has the duck confit and the gnocchi stuffed with rabbit, both were amazing!  We can't wait to come back and can't believe we haven't been here sooner. ",5
 Awesome spot - great food &amp; service. ,5
 We have been going here for years and every year seems to get worse with the food quality and flavor.  Too many chef changes over the years.  Won't be back for a while. ,3
 I enjoy food I can't make at home. There are other restaurants in Napa where the chef is exceptional and the cost of the experience is the same as Angele ,2
 Three Ducks Confidence was delicious ,5
" Loved the rustic setting but yet elegant. Our server was outstanding , explaining the menu and making recommendations. We were seated at a corner table- best table overlooking the river and the bar. It was a special experience. ",4
" We  dined at Angele for a late Sunday lunch and experienced a new lunch menu. Unfortunately, we found many of our favorite dishes no longer on the menu. Instead, the lunch menu is decidedly  more suited to foodies. Our party ordered burgers, soups and steak tartare and the tartare was excellent, but the burgers were overcooked. Too bad the lunch menu has changed. We have enjoyed Angele's food until now.  Perhaps the Sunday lunch menu is different than what is served on other days. That would be a good thing. ",3
" The menu muses of Angele have done it yet again! Truffle Deviled Eggs really do belong in heaven - but why wait? OH LORD, they have a full slice of truffle on them! Have you ever even had that? A few shavings is the usual amount or an 'essence', but this was beyond, just mouthwatering torture - I say torture, because then the last bite is gone, you're going to be very very sorry - so eat SLOW! (Or order seconds ;) The whole fish, again, AMAZING, wine, AMAZING, banana gratin, AMAZING.   And the service positively ROCKS. ",5
" We usually go to Angele for lunch because we love their lunch menu, but since it was oury anniversary, this evening we went for dinner. We had the most incredibly delicious lobster pot pie, beautifully cooked. Such a lovely evening! Perfect service too. ",5
" My now-legal 21 year old daughter and I went on a girls weekend to Napa and we celebrated her birthday at this fabulous French restaurant. They were notified ahead of time that it was a birthday celebration and I must say, she's never been recognized as much by an establishment as she was on Saturday night. The tequila shot at the bar, delicious pot o'creme for dessert and dessert wine, all made her feel very special. From the bottom of my heart, thank you for providing us with such an amazing experiencing. Oh...the French onion soup, ricotta custard, lobster pot pie and wild mushroom risotto were ALL stellar! We'll be back! ",5
" great food, great quality....best burger ever!  a bit expensive, but probably worth it....lunch is a good option ",4
" A friend and I made reservations for New Year's Eve. I called to make sure my no-salt diet could be maintained if there was a special menu hat night. They assured me that whether they created a special menu or stuck with their regular menu I would be accommodated. And I was -- beautifully. In fact, my friend and I order the same meal. Mine did not have salt, hers did. But both meals were delicious. I highly recommend this place for anyone who enjoys good food, even if you have special dietary needs. It's a gorgeous space inside and out. And the service is excellent. ",5
" The restaurant was well located in Napa valley town, next to the river.  There was outdoor seating with heaters. The tables were well spaced and the staff polite. The food portions were much smaller than everywhere else we had dined. The prices are quite expensive. The wine list was extensive. ",3
" Spent our anniversary dinner here, great energetic atmosphere and very good food. Location is right on the Napa River so you can get a quieter table, too.  Great service (thanks Jeff), and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. ",4
" Initial hostess asked my friend and I to wait at an extremely noisy bar while waiting for the remaining member of our party to park the car.  I said that the bar was too noisy and our remaining party member would be back in 5 minutes and asked to be seated.  The hostess turned to her supervisor, who sighed, acted like she was doing us a huge favor, and said ""go ahead.""  No smiles.  After that, all was good, but not great.  So many other outstanding and expensive places to eat that I would not go back. ",4
" I always enjoy my experiences at Angele; the food is consistently good and the service approaches perfection. Their french fries are the best in the Bay Area as is the French onion soup. A delightful place to spend a lazy afternoon looking at the Napa River, wine glass in hand. ",4
" Our party of four greatly enjoyed dinner, the service and the ambience. We enjoyed the evening of outdoor dining  with warm temperatures, but the restaurant is prepared for cooler evenings with lots of radiant heaters. It was recommended to us by friend who lives in Napa has a restaurant frequented by locals. ",5
" My wife and I always celebrate our anniversaries here. Our most recent visit included a special Old Fashioned recommended by our waiter with hints of cinnamon that was just superb. The appetizer menu had so many wonderful options we couldn't choose just two, and so we decided to forego entrees and just enjoy a tapas-style dinner, which was exceptional. We love this joint. We'll be back. ",5
" Lunch was okay. Dinner is the standout here. The burger at lunch was rather bare bones and not overly flavorful. Salads were pretty solid. However, I'll stick to dinners here from now on. ",4
 One of the best. We enjoy the outdoors. Love the hamburger and the French bistro appetizers. Highly recommended. ,5
" Our table was ready on time, our server Marcella was really lovely and our food was nothing but delicious.  Exceptional scallops and fall kale-apple salad. ",5
" A wonderful Napa dining experience.  Great food and warm, friendly service. ",5
 French fries!  Great wine list. ,5
" Food was amazing. The duck is to die forand the wild mushroom, truffle risotto is out of this world. ",5
 The Branzino was cooked perfectly and the salad was fresh and delicious! ,4
 Great location in The heart of Napa Downtown. Great menu and wine list. Loved The French onion soup ,5
 This was our second visit to Angele and we we much more impressed the first time. It was very noisy and two of our four meals were mediocre. The two who had roasted chicken weRe very impressed. ,3
" One of my favorite Napa spots....great for outdoor dining on the river or sitting at the bar.   Great  friendly happy servers and bartender.   Reasonably priced, large portions.   Great local and tourist spot. ",5
 Food was excellent Service was outstanding Our waiter was terrific and so was the food ,4
" I can't believe this was the first time we'd dined at Angele!! We typically go to Yountville, but this trip decided to stay in Napa and try Angele... let's just say we won't be going to Yountville anytime soon ! Angele was AMAZING. one of the best dining experiences in Napa - and we've been everywhere!! ",5
" Very pleasant lunch. Always great frites and  wonderful  hamburgers. I liked my salade nicoise but would have preferred the non-French way of serving tuna-fresh, not canned. Pleasant relaxing atmosphere and very welcoming. I appreciated the nice little touch of warmed cream for the coffee. Lunch was reasonable and good quality. ",4
 Food was ok at best. Service was horrible. Probably best to spend your time in Napa at another one of the great restaurants. ,1
 A nice restaurant close to the Marriott.  Lovely view of the kayakers  on the Napa River bend.  Overall good vibe. ,4
" If it were not for the deplorable service, Angele would definitely rate 5 stars - without a doubt.  We had a group of six for dinner and were thus able to sample a good portion of an overall excellent menu from start to finish. Appetizers were unique and came in a wide variety. Entrees were wonderful and well-proportioned, not too much or too little food. And the desserts were equally enjoyable. It appeared that you really could not go wrong with any of the menu options. The atmosphere on the outdoor patio simply added to our experience. The waiter for our table did not. He seemed overwhelmed by just about every request. Although he did OK with the food orders he had to be asked twice each time drinks were ordered. He seemed incredibly put off by our group bringing 3 bottles of wine to dinner, despite the fact that there was a hefty corkage fee (and should be expected in Napa Valley) and that we ordered another 3 bottles beyond those brought to the table. And although he could not have known this other than the group gratuity assigned our table, he did receive a tip of more than $200, so not sure what his problem was. Oh well. If you can live with a possible grumpy waiter (which we did and enjoyed ourselves thoroughly), then definitely visit Angele. ",4
" Pleasantly surprised by a very courteous and friendly hostess as has not always been the case. We were seated immediately at our reserved time on the requested patio. Lovely evening and with a nice view. Everything we ordered was wonderful. The wait staff was very good when you had their attention. Entire evening seemed to take a long time. Main courses arrived before we could order wine, however it was remedied quickly. As in the past a little disappointed from a service perspective. Go for the food and be patient? ",4
" Its hard to find ""French"" restaurants these days and Angele was that great romantic place for our 65th birthdays. They have a superb appetizer menu including country pate, which is so hard to find. There were so many great choices, it was hard to chose. Everything was beautifully prepared and delicious. Wonderful flavors. We even went back for lunch a few days later. The staff was also very friendly and helpful, never in a big hurry to get to the next table. Charming place. ",5
" I have been to Angele before and have always enjoyed the menu and the atmosphere.  Our waiter was excellent and took time to explain the specials as well as reply to any questions we might have.  We had shared an appetizer and each had our own main and the portions were ""just right"".  My only complaint was that the music was on the rock and roll style and I would have enjoyed either french music or just easy listening as it wasn't particularly a young crowd and the loudness of the music was a bit annoying. ",4
" Although it was unseasonably hot in Napa for Labor Day, 2015, we opted to dine indoors in air-conditioning instead of the patio reservation we requested.  The view of the Napa River from the outside patio is exceptional but the view of the river from the window-side table was also very nice. Watching the ducks on the river, while sipping a wine from Angele's wine list was like dining at a friend's house in the country. The duck with an assortment of three styles of corn was superb. My husband had the scallops which were exceptionally prepared by Angele's chef. The menu selections are limited but there is something for everyone from a carnivore to a vegan ",5
" We were a party of four, and the hard part was deciding what to have: excellent options for appetizers as well as main course.  I went for the ricotta and mushrooms appetizer, and it was a delightful change of pace from a nice salad.  Main course was their duck breast - not a bit left on the plate by the time I was done! ",4
 With so many reviews and still a high overall rating I expected much better food. The service was excellent and the restaurant setup was nice but there are restaurants with way better food at the same price point.  This was very disappointing for the cost. We will not be going back. ,2
" We read about  Angele on line, before  our first visit to Napa for a brief vacation this week.   It was all we had read and more; nice ambience, strong service, terrific local-source food from a diverse menu, with outstanding wine selections... and an on-site owner who takes great pride in her restaurant. So good we visited  a second  time, when we were only in town 5 days! A  must-visit. ",5
" Our server took extra pains with our 12 and 8 year old kids.  Incredibly friendly and described the specials and menu with amazing accuracy.  An absolutely fantastic menu.  Its been about 8 months since my last visit and they have added several things we liked.  The Lobster Boudin and the stuffed Quail were both fantastic additions.  Keep up the amazing work Bettina, its fantastic.  Oh, the fries....legend....must have. ",5
" Nice place,  beautiful location, great food and service. Reservations were easy and practical, arrived  30min earlier and went to our table in less than 5min. ",4
" Myself, wife, and our guest all opted for the special:  pork tenderloin stuffed with zucchini, wrapped in bacon, cooked to perfection.  Moist and tender, and served over a purée of eggplant and farro wrapped in ribbons of zucchini,pan juices.  Doesn't  get any better!  My wife ordered coffee pot de creme with a donut (who would have thought of such a pairing?) for dessert which shared.  The creme was light and silky, the donut was mini, served on a pool of creme anglaise and topped with a donut hole.  What a treat!  This was our second visit to Angele, our first earlier in the week for lunch and our experience was just as enjoyable.  Both visits we opted for seating in the patio, very comfortable and the wait staff do a fine job.  We will definitely tout Angele and keep it on our list of return to   when we are in the area. ",5
" This is one of our favorite restaurants! Every aspect is excellent and while expensive, it's with every penny. ",5
" Casual dining. Very reasonable. I thoroughly recommend all of the dishes that we had. Vegetarian bolognese, pork belly and chicken all delicious. The wine list was good too. The setting is relaxed and fun. ",5
" We enjoyed our visit to Angele - the food was great and well presented, but the highlight of our visit was our server. He was helpful and very attentive making our dinner exceptional. ",5
" French fare with a flair!  Angele has become yet another favorite restaurant in Napa. We were seated outside, and the weather was beautiful. I had the stuffed quail, which was excellent. Hubby had the suckling pig and was in heaven.  We will definitely come back when we visit Napa again. ",5
" This is definitely a 5 star restaurant. A bit pricey, but worth every penny. The food presentation was superb and the taste and quality of the food was worth it's price. Would definitely recommend this restaurant for anyone seeking fine french cuisine. ",5
 Fabulous service and food. Steak tartare and scallops were best I've ever had!! ,5
" This old world feel has indoor and patio dining with a view of the Napa River on the edge of town. Their menu is diverse.  The appetizers include crispy sweetbreads and steak tartar.  The wine list has French and Domestic wines that include modest priced as well as high end offerings.  The entrees show the diverse ability of the kitchen, and all three that we had were excellent. Bon Appetit. ",5
" One of our favorites in the Valley, always a great meal. ",5
 We had spotted Angèle a few months ago while in town shopping but it was closed for renovations. We made a promise to ourselves to come back. NYE presented that opportunity. We look forward to returning in warmer weather to enjoy the great white and rosé wines and the cool outdoor seating they have. ,4
 The menu was very limited and overpriced for what was served. ,2
 This was our second try at Angele. The wait to get seated (we had a reservation) was a bit awkward on both occasions. The bar is tight and the entrance to it is right up against the dining tables. Easier to wait outside. The food was hearty and inventive. Service (Dan was our server) was excellent. ,4
" The setting is intimate. I've had lunch here with colleagues and dinners with family. Different vibe for lunch and dinner but still a great place to go. Most of the dishes are excellent. Some appetizers sound good but are just OK (fried eggs are just breaded deviled eggs, salad bland and boring). Beef tartar, onion soup, foie gras and oysters are wonderful. The entries are excellent.  My only complaint is that the appetizers as a first course really don't go with the entrees. We've chosen to either have several appetizers as our dinner only or just have an entre. ",4
 This is our second time to done at Angele and we are as pleased as our first time 3 years ago.  There were several options for vegetarians and the chef made a vegetarian entree for one of our party that was beautiful and delicious.  Fish dishes are outstanding.  We will be back. ,5
" This was a treat to go here while vacationing in wine country.  There are a lot of great restaurants in the area, and this one rates among the top for us.  Our server had to be one of the best servers we have ever come across, and the food was impeccable.  Both the braised chicken and the veal were wonderful.  Try the deviled eggs for a treat, and a spin on the traditional. ",5
 My husband had the quail and I had s poached branding- both dishes were excellent. ,4
 Xmas eve dinner... Food wonderful but service was lacking; not personal at all ,3
 We dined here on Christmas Eve.  Initially there was a bit of confusion about the seating but that was quickly resolved.  The restaurant was very busy so the noise level was a bit high.  The wait staff were pleasant and helpful with their suggestions.  The meal and wine choices were excellent right down to the shaving of the truffles.  I loved the ambiance of a nice French restaurant.  We would love to return. ,4
" We ate at Angele on Christmas Eve, so it was a bit of a scene. Nevertheless, the service was still excellent. We loved most of our appetizers - pasta, custard type dish and kale salad - while the deviled eggs were good, but not great. For entrees, my husband loved his branzino; my son loved his steak and my daughter really liked her sausage stuffed quail. I liked my coq au vin, but didn't love it. After seeing a big flower pot of french fries go by, we ordered that as well as a side (not on the menu) and they were fantastic. We also ordered two desserts - the banana one was delicious and the pumpkin one was good, not great.  Overall, a terrific experience. ",5
 I chose the restaurant based off reviews and my family dinner was a great experience. The service was really great! The server was nice and helpful. The dishes are great - small/average but rich in taste. All the dishes were superb: - NY steak - Braised pork - Roasted Branzino -fries not on the menu that night but asked and they served it. ,5
" Great food (the warm ricotta custard and the mushroom risotto are both fantastic; I would skip the profiteroles they were a bit dry). Great service as well. However, the overall experience was hampered by sitting in the MOST uncomfortable seats we have ever experienced in a restaurant. They were incredibly hard and hurt to sit in. We left early and finished our meal at home becuse of it! Would be 5 stars if the chairs were bearable! ",4
" We had a delicious Christmas lunch at Angele.  I love their lunch menu an always have a difficult decision to make when I look at the menu.  I had the croque monsieur, which is perfectly prepared and just like it tastes in Paris, maybe better!  Also, my husband loved the fish and chips, so beautifully prepared.  Excellent French white wine as well.  Perfect service. ",5
" Angele is a favorite for lunch and dinner. It scores high in delicious food, indoor and outdoor ambience and great service. It's a special place. ",5
" This is a fantastic restaurant with a nice variety of food choices. The wine list is very good, as is their wines by the glass. I've enjoyed almost every entree on their menu and have had most of the appetizers. This place can be a little noisy. The outside dining is great. ",4
" We have eaten at Angele many times and enjoyed it each time.   Most recently, all in our party noted how small the entree portions were.  Otherwise, it was fine. ",4
" We chose this restaurant to help us celebrate a 30th anniversary weekend in Napa.  It couldn't have been nicer!  Top notch service and food in a comfortable setting.  It had everything we enjoy without being pretentious. I would highly recommend the risotto, and my husband raved about the duck.   Loved it! ",5
 I've dined here dozens of times... It never fails... This past xperience was amongst the best! ,5
" I've never had a bad meal at Angele, or a mediocre one for that matter.  We always come away saying how good everything was.  Quaint atmosphere, nice location at the end of Main St along the river water front, which is becoming more and more busy with restaurants and bars.  Definite recommendation when in Napa Valley. ",5
" Dined here more than a dozen times.  The service is always above the par.  The food is always good. This time, the mac and cheese is too watery and lack of cheese favor, my only disappointment. ",4
" For a restaurant in this class you expect at least good service, we got poor. A French restaurant who forgets the wine?! The duck confit was very nice so if they get the front of house sorted it would have potential in terms of price to quality. ",3
" My wife and I went here for dinner over the weekend and were a little disappointed.  Our biggest complaint was that the food prices were very expensive for what you got. I understand you are paying for the location near the water in downtown Napa, and I realize French restaurants don’t usually serve big plates. But you do expect to be somewhat full when paying the kind of money they charge! The restaurant was very nice, and we were given a great table all to ourselves. We ordered a glass of wine, and after it was served we ordered dinner. We weren’t real hungry since we ate a late lunch while wine tasting, so we skipped the appetizers and went right to the main course. But before we could even finish half of our glass of wine, our dinners were served! Maybe they had a lot of reservations that night. No chance for a second glass. I ordered the steak which was good but small, and my wife ordered the scallops which was also good, but not much food! There were only (5) scallops on the plate served with fregola  and sunchoke. My wife said it was good, but for $30 it was way overpriced and I wasn’t about to ask for a bite! Would probably not go back. ",4
 Very enjoyable.  We had one glitch where one couple split an entrée and I got the same entrée. My full entrée looked to be the same size as their split entrée.  The server rectified that after I complained twice. I would have given service 5 stars if she had rectified it right away.  She was otherwise excellent. ,4
 Angele continues to have an appealing menu that adjusts over time. The atmosphere is rather energetic and a little noisy but it was Saturday evening the restaurant was full.  The whole Branzino was excellent as well as the bacon-wrapped roast chicken.    The service was attentive and had good recommendations about the wine and various starter choices. ,4
 The restaurant has a great location and the service was excellent.  The food was okay. They need to work on their food. Some items lacked flavor while others were underwhelming.  Nothing was bad but nothing was good either. Our table of 7 was disappointed. You would think they could at least get one dish right out of 7. ,3
 very nice very nice very nice very nice very nice very nice ,4
 Good food and great location. The atmosphere of the restaurant and service are excellent as well. Thank you and I will visit again ,4
" Fantastic outdoor setting and fresh, well prepared food. ",5
" Angele is a lovely restaurant for a lunch on the patio. The restaurant is right next to the river, so you feel *almost* like you are right on the Seine. The service was upscale and professional without being too snooty. The food was wonderful. It is worth a trip for a nice afternoon. ",5
" The atmosphere is lovely, the food is rich as you would expect, yet it was a bit noisy even on a Wednesday night.  I wouldn't hesitate to return.  The appetizer was ricotta tart with truffles.  The beef was excellent and the risotto very rich but fantastic.  We saved room for profiteroles and I only wish there were more (we shared...next time I'm ordering my own.  I have a thing for fancy french pastries and these were the best. ",4
" Everything was great and I mean everything. Special meal. If you can,also ask for Hillary the waitress.  Besides being a delight, She is very helpful in understanding all parts of the menu. ",5
" We enjoyed another nice evening following a jazz performance at Silo's on a Sunday afternoon.  The food is excellent, ambiance pleasing, and service attentive.  Try the french onion soup. Angele is our ""go-to"" downtown Napa spot. ",4
 i enjoyed every bit of the sweetbread so beautifully done! ,4
 Great food and service.  Dog friendly on the patio. ,5
" Restaurant in a super cute area of Napa.  Food, bread, and cocktails all very good.  Nice area to walk around too! ",4
" So many restaurants fail to reinvent themselves, but not Angele.   Angele is so diligent in tailoring its menu to the seasons and unfailingly introducing the most innovative and savory new dishes.  Every dish was to die for - omg the custard!! the Ono!! the Scallops!!   Everything was PERFECT. The servers were PERFECT.   Best restaurant in Napa, bar none. ",5
 The Rouas family has been in the hospitality business in Napa for a long time in both hotels and restaurants. Angele is situated in the historic Hatt Building. Everything here is first class. The french onion soup and steak tartare was a great way to start. We all had the Daybook Scallops which was nice but not great. We were impressed when they cleaned the table between courses since we have not see this for a while. ,4
 Was great service and food. Lots of locals eat there nice place for a group or evening out just for some drinks and appetizers ! ,5
 The duck confit was exceptional. Great feel to the restaurant. Good value. ,5
 As always a great evening ,5
" We had a day planned in Napa for friends turning 30. Our group had a little one and a total of 8. Everything came out in a timely fashion, the food presentation was beautiful, and our wait staff was attentive. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone celebrating something special with a large group (babies included). ",5
 A friend's recommendation led us to this restaurant and now my husband can't get enough of the bacon wrapped chicken!  The menu is reasonably priced and extremely delicious! ,5
" Came here for wife's birthday when were unable to land reservations at the French Laundary. Absolutely thrilled with the food, service, and atmosphere - also with the price and no-hassle for outstanding French cuisine. My wife ordered the Quail and I had the Sonoma Duck Breast. Both were fantastic, served with elegance, and in the right time, as were the excellent oysters we had as appetizer. Good wine selection for us, decent overall prices.  Out the door happy for $140. ",5
" The food was fantastic, and the ambiance is definitely Provence.  The presentation of each course was a work of art....beautiful and delicious at the same time!  The service is exceptional, and the atmosphere was conducive to pleasant conversation.  We can't wait to go back! ",5
 Great night with the wife. Last minute find but man! What a find. The food was devine and a great view overlooking the Russian river.  Highly recommended! ,5
" We brought out of town guests, and we were all impressed.    Wonderful service, wait staff attentive, pleasant, answered all questions, made suggestions, and were very helpful.   Food was really excellent.   A most enjoyable meal.   Delicious. ",5
 Fried deviled eggs were fabulous! We couldn't believe we were eating the skin of the avocado and it was wonderful. The croque monsieur and croque madame were a little bit too heavy. We could've gone for much less bread. But the flavor was there. ,5
 We went on Sunday for a leisurely lunch.  Luckily we were seated right away. I was very impressed with the food and level of service. I had the steak tartare which was wonderful  (I actually came to this restaurant because I saw they serve this on their on line menu- few places offer it these days) My husband had the Croque Monsieur which he loved. Would definitely go again ,4
" We have been eating here for years since it opened and have always enjoyed the food and service. This time we were there to celebrate a special occasion for the young couple we were with - their engagement. I had phoned ahead and told the Angele -how lovely it was of Angele to greet them at the table with 2 glasses of sparkling wine. We were outside on the patio along the river - such a prime spot in Napa now. The food was outstanding and so well presented - oysters, pate en croute, little gem salad, salad with tomatoes and melon, Hamachi Crudo salad with figs, scallops, and duck. Truly excellent reflecting a chef's careful hand. The only wrinkle was the service - our server was off all night. He lagged in coming to our table, he seemed to forget us, he was very disengaged and aloof. When we tried to order an appetizer to share before we placed our dinner orders he told us we could not do that! He said he had to take all orders at once and walked away. Normally I would have said something to management but we were with guests so I did not want to do that. Also, if you order a Pinot Noir by the glass, they always bring it in a regular glass. You have to ask for a Pinot glass - Pinot is one varietal that truly benefits from the special glass. ",4
" Loved our table in the patio - it was just perfect - up against the outside wall.  Our server was very obliging and let us take our time ordering and eating.   Two ordered the Croque's - while they were tasty the bread was very difficult to cut - it was over toasted.   A friend had raved about the deep fried deviled eggs - they were pretty to look at and the avocado mousse was delish - the rest was : ""what's all the hype?""     An assistant server took our leftovers to box and ended up giving each of us the wrong one.  Good thing I looked before leaving.  We should have asked for the box and did our own boxing up of leftovers. ",4
" We had a wonderful server (wish I could recall her name) who although was relatively new to the area was still quite knowledgeable and poised! Delicious, as always! ",5
 I have been to Angeles a few times before and they never disappoint.  The food is original and very well prepared.  Great choices even if you're not a fan of French food.  The outdoor patio is especially nice for lunch. ,5
 We wanted our duaghter and boyfriend to experience the food as we did this past winter. Great food and outside seating ,5
" Lovely restaurant, ambiance and exceptional food. We loved our experience ",5
" Staff greeting very friendly ... evening went downhill when the menu was a mystery, descriptions were just as mysterious, and the food was underwhelming at best.  The bacon-wrapped chicken was okay, but my husband's beef was tough and flavorless.  Not sure who they're trying to impress... ",2
" Our meal at Angele was outstanding, as expected- the scallops were amazing and the fried deviled eggs (as an appetizer) were remarkable.  Poor service overshadowed the experience, however.  Our server simply ignored our table (as well as others around us), seemingly focusing his attention on two tables with little regard for other diners.   Perhaps he thought they would be bigger spenders?  In any case, the hostess and the manager took all of our orders, save our dessert order at the end of the meal when our server finally awakened to our existence.   At a restaurant of this class, we expected more. ",2
 Nice romantic dinner with good food. My fish was well prepared. Wine was great as well ,5
" Pretentious staff dampened the mood in this great location but surprisingly uncrowded restaurant. Bartender wasn't busy but managed to forget my drink request after asking twice. Waitress barely knew her menu and service was lackadaisical. Menu, while creative, was a disappointment as both our dishes were bland. We asked for salt, which never arrived. ",2
 I was really happy with our dinner.  We had delicious oysters and then I had the scallops.  Everyone else had a steak.  I really had a hard time deciding.  I loved it. ,5
" Loved the location, but thought the food was well below the standards of Napa, especially for the price. ",3
" Such great write ups, but it fell flat for us. Great bread; wouldn't have ordered the ricotta app with toast if I'd known bread would soon land on the table. Great cocktails, but not a notable meal. ",3
" Yellow outside tent was nice Little gems needs a better dressing Steak and pappardelle dishes were good along with pate, Male server seemed a bit distant and others needed to cover for him. Heater on first table of 4 may need repositioning so that it is not so intense on the diner facing out. ",3
" I was searching for traditional French and while can't say that I found it, it was nonetheless a fince dining experience.  Crispy Sweetbreads appetizer - Simply outstanding.  I just wish they hadn't ruined perfectly good polenta with cauliflower. :-)   Pan-Seared Scallops entree, cooked the way  l asked - excellent.  Drinks are quite expensive.  I capped the meal off with dessert  and Calvados.  Barely a splash in the snifter at a cost of $24.    Staff was attentive and prompt. ",4
 Never disappoints! Food and service always spot on! Great comfortable casual atmosphere ,5
" It's not that the food was bad, it's more a case there are better places to go. My lobster and shrimp boudin and steak tartare were quite good.  The pork belly, pork loin combo was OK, the loin being a bit dry and with not a lot of flavor.   Just OK ",4
" We've been dining at Angele over ten years, and it rarely disappoints. ",4
" yes, it the normal lunch spot for clients and it does the job ",5
" I have eaten here many times, and it is just as perfect as ever.  My last visit was for a friend's birthday.  We sat outside on the deck on a warm, pleasant day and enjoyed a relaxing meal.  Our server was very attentive and helpful in making menu suggestions.  We could not have had a better meal. ",5
" This was our third time at the pet friendly restaurant and each time seems to be better than the last.  Dinner was fantastic.  The highlight for me was the cold roasted corn soup which was just our of this world.  I passed it around TWICE to my fellow diners (A FIRST) and they couldn't believe how good it was.    We also had the pate foie gras (yummmm), and the housemade ricotta, which was out of this world tasty.  The meal was terrific - one of the diners and I had the scallops (delicious) and a third had the duck (succulent).  The service was outstanding - everyone was interested, helpful and genuinely looked after us. This is a restaurant that we will continue to visit every time we are near.  It is truly a wonderful experience over and over again. ",5
 Angele provides consistantly  great food and service for that special lunch or dinner.  The patio is dog friendly. ,4
 We ate outside on the patio with our puppy. It's the second restaurant that did not want our puppy on the seat. Very good food. Service was okay. Attentive to a degree and not overbearing. Lucas was our server. Too bad the Fish Story closed. That was our favorite. ,4
" As soon as we were seated on the patio overlooking the Napa River, our very kind server, Francisco, delivered a glass of bubbly for our dinner celebration. That started the evening on a special note. The food is first class. The lobster boudin and hamachi crudo were stand outs as appetizers. The French fries were good, yet a bit disappointing based on pomme frites we’ve enjoyed in France.  The main courses of duck and pork were large portions and absolutely superb. Atmosphere is charming with a location at the end of the street.  Take pleasure in a French experience right in down town Napa. C’est formidable! ",5
" We had the half chicken with stuffing.  Chicken Portion was tiny but taste good.   Stuffing consisted of large french bread. Sauce was excellent.  Dessert was wonderful! Ice cream stuffed profiteroles, Crispy on the outside and very flavorful! ",3
 Angele  food pricing to exp. tourist prices! Not local friendly.menu needs make over. ,4
" This place is so charming, the front of house staff is friendly and accommodating, but the wait staff is inattentive, and my food arrived over-cooked and stone cold. I sent back my over done beef which was practically chilly compared to the accompaniments on the plate which were piping hot. My dinner companion had completely finished his enteee when my redone entree arrived. Was is the fault if the waiter or the chef? Someone wasn't paying attention. ",3
" I love to sit on the patio outside on a warm summer evening, it is truly a perfect place to be. The food, the ambience, the service is all great. We loved the fried deviled eggs to start and the fried mini pepper (I forget what they are called) delicious! I had the scallops and they were also very good. Everyone enjoyed their meals. ",5
" I'm a local vintner and haven't been to Angele in a while but I remember the wonderful true French cooking and that's what we set out to experience the other night. Unfortunately that's not really what we found. Although the names on the menu sounded like the good old French classics the preparations were strangely skewed. Country Terrine was laced with chili powder and cumin, quail was breaded and deep fried to a well done...all I could taste was the breading, had no idea what the overdone mystery meat was. Roast potatoes that were huge chunks of mushy banquet quality adornments, Quail Roulades that were nothing more than chunky meat sausages that were so over salted that you couldn't eat them by themselves...only with the under seasoned entree. It's a shame that the food was not true to a proper French preparation but it's even more shameful that in Napa Valley where every restaurant has it's A-game this food was just simply mediocre. Given the setting and the prices this made for a very bad experience. My fingers are crossed that the chef is not going to last...I miss Angele. ",2
 Duck was terrible had been cooked hours before and warmed skin was awful. Oysters were served on platter of used ice and the lemon had already been used. Foie gras was average. Best part of the meal were the French fries. Very disappointed in the meal. ,3
 Petrale sole was like butter in my mouth!  Delcious.   Service is always impeccable.  Hostesses remember your name and greet you warmly. ,5
" With my Open Table reservation, I requested an outside table. When we arrived, we were informed an outside table would require a 30 minute wait. We decided to sit inside. Our server was good. My wife ordered the halibut special. Her fish was dry and over cooked. I ordered the duck. It was okay, but nothing special. Cocktails sounded better on the menu than they tasted. The coffee pot du cream dessert was something special, but nothing else was. Compared to the other places we ate in the area that weekend, we were very disappointed by the restaurant. We will neither return nor recommend. ",1
 Service and food were absolutely stunning.  Romantic view of the Napa river.  The menu is small and to the point made with fresh ingredients.  The atmosphere was casual and for an upper end restaurant the dress code only requires no beachwear.  The service was impeccable and the wait staff wasn't too overbearing.  We will definitely do dinner here again when we come back to Napa. ,5
" Everything was great, except the wait staff seemed off. Our primary waiter was very polite and since my party of two was chatting a lot, he checked in with us frequently to get our order.  He wasn't really friendly or attentive after that. Another wait person delivered our food and wanted to put down the wrong dish for each of us. We were asked about a second glass of wine, and yet another wait  person delivered our wine and when he set mine down and said what it was, I told him that was not what I had been drinking. That wait person almost challenged me on it, but then went away to get what I had originally ordered.  Those mistakes are off putting, even though the food and outdoor setting were great. ",4
" Angele is always a great place to eat Brunch, Lunch or Dinner. Every time we go there, we always walk away talking about how great the food and service are. ",4
" The food 🍲 was incredibly delicious. This was our second time dining here, and it was better than the first. We strongly recommend this establishment. ",5
 We had a wonderful meal with lots of good options. Service was top of the line and enhanced our experience. ,5
" Great food, wonderful service and menu recommendations. If you are thinking of going - go! ",5
 The Bronzino was awesome...and the halibut was superb as well. Wonderful view of the river and a great ambiance inside. ,5
" The appetizers were amazing.  I had the lobster/shrimp boudine, which was unlike anything I've ever had before. Yum! My daughter loved her leeks too.  My lamb entree was good, but the trumpet mushrooms accompanying the lamb were stupendous. The pinot noir by the glass was NOT so special.  Would like to see more local wines available by the glass.  Service was excellent and friendly (important to me),  the room a bit loud for me.  All in all, I'd go back. ",4
" Went sailing with friends on a perfect day, Napa river was shining and happy...So as we swayed  in the wind our hearts were happy, now our souls needed to be feed..We docked at new dock a very short walking distance to Angele..Perfect wonderful dock...With a 1 pm reservation, seating was prompt and view was inviting..With 2 bottles of wine from our Estate Vineyard, we wandered onto the Menu..Wow..could this get any better...Yes! it did...Food was delightful, wine was showing well and the service was attentive, but gave you space to talk to old friends..The menu is diverse, something for everyone and plentiful for light suppers...Fresh it was and pleasant to the palette..Only one reason we would not go back..The Corkage fee  $25 for first 2 bottles then  $35 thereafter..one fee is dropped if you purchase wine from their list,  which is wonderful, but pricey...With the prices they have on the menu they should lower the corkage fee..adding another 50 or more dollars to the tab is a bit much for a place like this... How about a locals break on Corkage, after all we are good for business and represent  you..If you care not to bring a bottle ...Beverages by the glass is the best idea!!  Now take time to  enjoy life and stop in at Angele...Cheers ",4
" This was an amazing exceptional experience!  (Just go. . .really) We had the Foie Grois with strawberries and brioche that was one of the bests I have ever had. . .close your eyes and savor delicious!  The steak tartar was wonderful and the Poblano peppers grilled with finishing salt were so good we ordered an extra order on our way out to go for a late night snack.  I had the quail and I adored every bite and my husband got the pork belly I believe and we was in heaven.  While our server was nice and eventually got us everything we needed, it wasn't the most impressed or attentive we have ever experienced but fine all the same!  They had my favorite white wine and we were blissed out by the whole experience.  Ended up talking to some fellow foodies from LA later that weekend that asked us where we ate and when we told them Angele's they lit up and said it was they absolute favorite place too so it wasn't a random experience.  One note, one person next to us was not happy with their meal but I have to say that that person look like they came in with a personal cloud of negativity and sometimes people get exactly what they put out in the universe.  We watched the restaurant handle the situation beautifully and being in customer service it seemed clear that she was one of those people you simply can't please cause of who they are. It was interestingly clear that while occasionally we see poor reviews for great places, it makes me wonder if it's more the person and their poor attitude than any accurate reflection on such a wonderful establishment like this. ",5
" We had a great experience,  all courses were excellent and a great drinks list. Service staff were very friendly and efficient. Would definitely recommend. ",4
 Great ambiance and excellent waiter who recommended a fine alternative wine when the one we wanted wasn't available. Fries and sweetbreads from the appetizer menu were delicious. Steak tartare a bit too spicy for our taste. Would definitely go back again. ,4
" Food was good. Had a enjoyable brunch. Was as expected. I already have a high opinion of this restaurant so it definitely was met. Service, attention, courtesy. Cannot really ask for more. Would recommend. FYI, it is not the cheapest, nor the most expensive, but the bill can get rather high. ",5
 Every aspect of this restaurant is excellent.  The owner/manager  is a constant presence and it is obvious that everyone that works there is invested in making every dining experience a good one. This along with some of the best  food in the valley makes Angeles a must for locals as well as visitors.        Really good!! ,5
" Great food, spotless service, quite a gem! ",5
" Thank you, Dan for your excellent hospitality.  We had a great time enjoying each others company, but the highlight of the evening was the great food and your service.  Thanks again.  Jim  Jim Sullivan Castello di Amorosa 707-967-6278 ",5
" We're long time fans of this restaurant and have been through many ups and downs, but overall, it has always managed to impress us. The sweetbreads were good, the oysters fresh and firm, the fava bean salad was terrific, as were our main courses. My husband ordered lamb and they brought out a pork chop instead, which did not surprise me as I caught our waiter's eye following a voluptuous young lady while taking our order. Ironically he repeated back what we ordered correctly and then proceeded to have something else prepared/delivered to the table. He apologized and was very thoughtful about it, but nevertheless...   The halibut was perfectly cooked and the overall experience was pleasant. We will be back. Incidentally they have the sweetest and most accommodating receptionist we've ever encountered there. ",4
" Great foid, great service, amazing bar ",5
" You can't beat it.  You just can't. If you want to eat in Napa and have the best possible meal, every single time, this is where you go.   If you arrive earlier in the evening, you can enjoy the sun setting over the river and the light hitting the beautiful yellow shade over the outdoor seating area.  The windows inside always make me think of the inside of a ship - thick and comforting white-washed walls with light blue details.  Little potted plants.  The quiet early hours slowly give rise to a warming din of happy conversation... but it never gets too loud. It feels celebratory without feeling alcoholic.   The staff brings ""bistro' to a new height of elegance while always remaining quick to smile.  Just read through the menu - that's all you need to know as far as food. They deliver. Creative, in the French tradition, with plenty of innovation and lightness. Pure cuisine, and I mean that like 'unadulterated' and cuisine in the highest sense of the word.  And don't be afraid to ask questions! They always answer honestly and with useful information. ",5
" This was a great restaurant to visit while we were staying in Napa!  And the only reason I rated the noise level as ""moderate"" is because it was a crowded Friday night at prime time, so it was moderate, but not in an annoying way.  We still felt so secluded at our cozy two person table.  The food was ridiculously good here.  Both my husband &amp; I are foodies.  I can't remember what he had (steak of some sorts), but I had the chicken dish &amp; it may have been the best dish I ever had!  I am also gluten free &amp; they were soo accomodating, so I didn't feel like I had to sacrifice taste at all.  This is a popular place because of how good it is, so I would make a reservation, especially on the weekend or during the busy season.  We will be back! ",5
" As soon as we did not order expensive items and wine, we were treated rudely, the expression'on the waiter's face said it all,, you are bothering me, not professional. Food was really average, so loud you could not hear. I would have come back , however I am a local and I think there are places to go that are much better in service. I got the idea that there is no care at all for service, the customer or any explanation of the food, or specials. One of the worst Napa Valley experiences I have had, and  I take clients to lunch 2-3 times per week. Too bad. ",1
" Angèle is one of my favorite restaurants in the valley and I visit it frequently. The food, ambiance, and service never disappoint. ",5
" We chose Angele due to its proximity to our hotel within walking distance after our host at a vineyard recommended it. Both the interior and outdoor seating areas are lovely. The cocktail choices were innovative and delicious. Our food was very good, though my scallops arrived luke-warm. They tasted great, but I think they sat while my husbands cassoulet finished. All in all, we had a lovely evening here and would return again. ",4
 Love this place ...but it is a bit pricey. go for lunch instead when you can order the hamburger. The roasted beet salad was delicious! ,4
" The ambience at Angeles' outdoor patio is always special. We were greeted with a very friendly hostess who accommodated one of our disabled guests with great style and diplomacy. Throughout the meal the service and staff very friendly but the pace of service was way too slow.  The oysters were very fresh and served with a nicely balanced mignonette sauce and lemon. The spring garlic potato soup was was delicious. The entrees of a hamburger (gargantuan though slightly over done), Croque Madame and Lentils salad with a Lyonnais Salad were a solid B+.   The experience was a huge improvement over our last two visits which were very disappointing in food quality.  Now if the pace of the service could be picked up I'd add another star. ",3
" We took some of our co-workers here for a celebratory lunch.  The ambiance is lovely and particularly if it is a sunny day and you can sit outside. In the winter, if you sit inside, you can almost pretend you are in Paris with bouillabaisse and a glass of burgundy for lunch. This particular lunch, we had escargots, a croque monsieur, a salade nicoise and excellent soup.  Just a lovely way to spend an afternoon with friends in Napa. ",4
 The dining experience was great.  We were two couples and all ordered different meals.  The meals were presented nicely and our waiter was outstanding.  Great night. ,4
 Excellent in every way.  Only minus was the swiftness with which the table was cleared--before we were finished. ,4
" This is our favorite restaurant in Napa. Food is delectable, service friendly and efficient while not being over bearing. ",5
 Went to Angele's for Easter brunch.  The food was good however there were not too many choices for breakfast food on the menu. We enjoyed ourselves very much. They make a spicy and very tasty Bloody Mary !  Service was great! It was fun! ,4
" We haven't been to Angele's for dinner for about two years.  So many places to eat here in Napa and being a local we go to places that aren't so crowded.  Son was in town for Easter so felt we needed to branch out and try someplace almost new.  Well, we were delighted with the menu.  The food was fantastic, I looked at previous reviews and went with their recommendations.  The pate for first course was wonderful and my husband had the lobster dish.  Three of us had the duck breast and my husband had the traditional cassolette.  Amazing.    ONLY thing I would change...the noise in the room was way above comfortable.  The room was very busy.  If you eat out side there will not be the problem.  Also, the chairs are uncomfortable.  The backs of the chairs  are 'off' , so you can't sit back.   But, still don't let this hold you back!  Go! ",4
 Beautiful spot to enjoy lunch on the patio at Angele. After a morning of wine tasting enjoy a French-inspired lunch on the shady patio at Angele in Downtown Napa. ,4
 We've been here on several special occasions and had a good time every time. Since we live pretty far we only visited during brunch hours on the weekends.  The food is great the ambiance as well. The service maybe a tad bit slow but overall the experience is great and we will likely be back. ,5
" I had the duck liver mousse, ricotta with caramelized onions and bacon and oysters. These starters were great and the entrees were braised lamb, Alaskan halibut and suckling pig. The lamb and halibut was cook perfectly. It was timed right. The sauce for the lamb was a little too salty however, the taste was balanced. The pork sous vide was prefect. I would prefer more crunch on the pork skin. The plate was well balanced.  We ordered the pear pie, banana strudel and homemade vanilla ice cream. All was great except the strudel which felt like just a crumbled and parts were soggy. The pear pie was amazing and tasted great with a crumbly crust and prefect creme fraichè on the top. The service could be better with a little more organization and subpar for a French restaurant. They forgot a side that I have ordered. Overall, this was a good experience compared to my Alexander Steakhouse which service was worse than this place. ",4
 We eat here so regularly that we should have a nameplate on the wall at our table.  Could the staff be any more charming?  The food any more delectable? The atmosphere any more avant-bistro? The timing of each dish and wine any more perfect?   Absolutely not - everything is PERFECT. Would not change a single thing.  And you MUST try the Levain Crusted Lobster and Shrimp Boudin - My GOD.  Bravo - another 10 meal and experience!!! ,5
" The food and service were excellent. My major area of concern for this restaurant is the pet friendly dogs at the table tolerance. I came for a great meal at a great restaurant and was seated next to a couple with a large dog that barked.  That was not as disturbing as them Feeding the dog from the table and the server who stopped by to pet the dog. Hopefully washing his hands before returning to work.  I love animals but do not feel they need to be in a restaurant, albeit on the patio.  It is a health concern that should be addressed. ",4
 Angele is one of our favorite places to eat in Napa. This was further demonstrated this past weekend when we visited to celebrate a birthday and an anniversary. They took such great care to make us feel special. The service is polished and perfect. The food even more so...truly one of Napa's finest places to eat. Can't beat the location either. ,5
 I am never disappointed  at ANGELE.  My boyfriend had the lamb that was out of this world as is the  macaroni.  I had the pork belly plate and it was very good.   Make reservations as they book up quickly. ,5
" My husband took me to Angeles for our second date over five years ago. We thought it would be the perfect place for our elopment dinner and it absolutely was! The service was excellent, the ambiance romantic yet upbeat and the food was superb! We each had the duck and honestly it was the best duck dish that I have ever had! I love how the chef cooks the duck perfectly and sprinkles sea salt on top. The presentation is beautiful and an order of frites to share on the side is a must. Angele made our elopment dinner very special and I would love to go back every year for our anniversary. ",5
" The service is great and the bartender was extremely helpful as the choices were numerous, and all sounded wonderful. I selected the suckling pig, crispy pork belly, Brussel sprouts, red Anson Mills polenta, Rosemary pork jus and paired it with a red wine - Chateauneuf du Pape Gigonan Vigne du Regent Rhone 2010. What a meal! ",5
" Angele is and has been one of our favorite restaurants in Napa.  The food, service and ambiance are always excellent!  We would recommend Angele to locals as well as visitors! ",5
 My wife and I gave ourselves an anniversary treat at Angeles. The service was outstanding and the food pleasing. The halibut lacked flavour but the duck was great.. ,4
 Always high standards and so nice to go to a restaurant that has authentic cuisine from one country.  I have had enough so-called fusion food. ,4
" Superb as usual!  One gets regularly spoiled at Ange'le.  Food, service, request for quiet table, tolerance for letting us dawdle for five hours while catching-up on a two-year absence from each other, all just outstanding!  Six or seven stars on a five point scale.  My review nickname is in error; it should read ""83 year-old fan"" but I do not know how to change it! ",5
" Whenever I am in Napa I go to Angele..........This time they were out of the mussels and served clams  (still great) and they were out of the   appetizer  of the day...That said,  .... everything I had was marvelous. They do know how to make French fries ......................... ",5
" Butter Bean Cassoulet w/Quail, Tomato Garlic Soup &amp; Prosciutto and Kale Wrapped Monkfish were outstanding. Good cocktails and nice, accessible wine list. Service was friendly and efficient. Lively atmosphere. A Napa gem. ",4
" Excellent experience, superb service. Food was fantastic.  Rustic high raftered wooden room, elegantly decorated and softly lit. A bit echoey, but that just proves its popularity. Excellent dining experience. ",5
" Our table was not ready at our on-time arrival so we had to wait 15 or 20 minutes. Service was so slow that after seating, food did not arrive until well over an hour later, yet the restaurant did not seem that busy. I had ordered the special sandwich, which was pulled pork, but there was very little pork on the sandwich. It was mostly sauce and fat. Lunch was a disappointment. Fortunately, for the other members of my party, their food was fine. Not likely I will go back. ",2
" Amazing as always!!! The team at Angele never fails to impress. My husband and I started with oysters and foie gras, he had the monkfish and I savor end the cassoulet again:) Thank you again to the entire team for a great evening ",5
" We go to Angeles often for their great food, great service and ambience.  We especially like to take friend from out of town. ",5
" Great dinner spot with friends.  Tried the tasting menu, was happy with the chef's selection, they were flexible with substituting.  Wine was great.  Service was excellent, he was helpful with our choices and very attentive. ",4
" With so many restaurants to choose from in the Bay Area and Wine Country, we rarely eat somewhere and have such a pleasant experience with delicious food, that we look forward to returning.  We can honestly say that we hope to be able to return to Angele next time we are in Napa. We'd be happy to return just the two of us, but also thought of several friends and relatives who would enjoy joining us, and would also look forward to coming in warmer weather when we could dine al fresco.  Food was superb, both in taste and presentation, with decent portions. and we had trouble narrowing down the selection. Didn't have wine so no comment there.  Ordered one cocktail which was good, accepting that $12 for a smallish cocktail is now becoming typical :( Service was excellent and setting/ambiance was just so pleasant and comfortable.  Glad they had parking lot right there too. ",5
" It's become a bit of a joke when friends ask where I'm going for dinner, because it's always Angele! We so appreciate the charm and attention of all the staff, from the moment we arrive to every detail - even the bread and butter (so yummy!) is placed with a warm smile and a 'welcome back'!  A few notes about the meal: The duck liver mousse - exceptional!! Very smooth and with none of the gamy bite you sometimes get with liver.  Served with just-toasted freshly made thick sourdough wheat, simply perfect!  Main dishes - the Flat Iron Steak (had us both speechless) and the Monkfish (rich and mild at once and cooked to the precise degree) - we highly recommend both!   Server note: I just stopped eating pork and our server didn't miss a beat assuring me that it was no problem to remove the prosciutto from my dish.  I always appreciate this!  Memorable as always! xoxo ",5
" Angele is one of my favorite restaurants in Napa.  I consider it a very special occasion restaurant as it can be a bit pricey, but the food and the atmosphere are well worth the price if your budget can afford it.  I have never had a bad experience at this establishment and the staff is always welcoming an attentive to your needs.  I just had brunch there with friends.  We celebrated our 60th birthdays together.  We had the ever-popular Banana “Gratin” Almond Streusel, Pastry Cream, Vanilla Bean Ice Cream.  It was so wonderful!  It would be great with a hot cup of coffee or tea. I had the housemade Chicken Sausage, Braised Cabbage and Apples, Whole Grain Mustard Sauce, Poached Eggs.  Every bite was scrumptious! I have had the “Croque Monsieur”, Tartine with Parisian Ham, Melted Gruyére, Toasted Levain, Bechamél Sauce (Madame with Egg) many times.  It is a favorite!  I highly recommend this as a place to stop in your Napa experience. ",5
" I was extremely disappointed. I had read very good reviews but I was very dissatisfied with the experience. It was a horrible dinner and given that it was Valentine's day, I  would've expected more. The server was polite but when we requested the tasting menu, someone (she failed to introduce herself) came to unform us that it wasn't available for the night even though their Valentine's day menu had it as an option. We were extremely disappointed but finally ordered a risotto for appetizer but it was not cooked well. We just took a bite a had the server take it away. We ordered the peppered steak and the pork belly both of which were terrible. The steak was not edible as all you could taste was pepper. I  understand it was the peppered steak but they might as well just served pepper. The pork belly had no flavor. It didn't have any condiments. Minutes later another lady, again horrible service as she didn't introduced herself to us, asked if the chef could cook something else but every single dish had been disappointed that we weren't interested in eating anything that chef cooked. She rudely said that he was a good chef, I'm not sure if she has no taste buds or has a completely wrong opinion on what good food tastes because the entire meal was horrible! ",1
" We sat at a back corner. Waitresses were nice, but kitchen was soooooo slow. We got our cocktails in about 10 mins, appetizer soon after, but we waited for entrees for another 40 minutes if not longer. The three tables next to us were cleared and new people got seated and were getting food before we started eating again. ",3
" My favorite restaurant in Napa. I've been coming to Angele since high school and it has never disappointed. The food, regardless of what you get, is always some of the best around. The Duck, the steak, scallops, all delicious. They have great cocktails and a fantastic wine list. The ambiance is very romantic and the location is right on the river walk. One of my favorite dishes here is dessert and it is the banana gratin! This is a must! ",5
 I have eaten here for years and I have to say that last few times have been really exceptional. Loved everything we had.  As someone that eats out at least 5 times a week I have to highly recommend this as somewhere to dine when in Napa Valley out of all the many choices there are. Bravo! ,5
 Came in for brunch and was pleasantly surprised by the rustic French interior and delicious French cookery. Service was a little slow on this visit but otherwise a great time. Will definitely be back. ,4
 We had an OK experience at Angele. Food was good but service was a little spotty. Probably would look for something with a little better atmosphere for the price of entrees. ,4
" We visited Napa and used Google to help us find restaurants in the area. This one quickly caught our attention, so we gave it a try. The ambiance was perfect for a romantic dinner before returning home. The food was absolutely delicious and we cannot wait to try more items from the menu next time. ",5
" There are wonderful craft cocktails (we had ""el bandito"", ""I'll have another"" ""fist full"" and ""Lemon sage press"", appetizers-- Steak tartar, home made ricotta and two wonderful entrees.  We had the special--duck, perfectly cooked and fish and chips which was petrale sole and wonderful french fries.  They let us take our time and have a leisurely brunch. Alex was a attentive server and took great care of us. The tartar was perfectly presented with delicious bread and the ricotta was the best we ever had.  The duck was wonderful--no grease and seasoned just right.   We enjoyed the coffee and dessert which was a lavender glazed doughnut and chocolate mousse.  We would go back as often as we could.  Definitely a 100 best restaurant in the area! ",5
 The food we ordered was a steak that came very under cooked and when we returned it the food came back like leather.  The onion soup was very sweet and not good.  The quail was bland and not very good.  The service was good and they were helpful but we were not interested in getting dessert to make up for the bad food. ,1
" We were attending a performance in Napa downtown and wanted to eat nearby. Booked Angele because it was close to the show venue without any prior knowledge of the restaurant and was very pleased. By 6:00pm on a Saturday evening, the bar and restaurant was already quite busy.  Our server was friendly, professiona, knowledgable and attentive. Cocktails were lovely and the ""Diane Lane"" and Lemon Drop were favorites.  In our party of four, one had duck, one had steak and two tried the Coq Au Vin for entrees and we all really enjoyed our dishes. The appetizers we tried included French onion soup and a lobster and shrimp dish that were also good, however, the soup was a bit on the sweet side and must have contained an entire onion per serving.  For dessert we tried the pear tart and the chocolate spice cake. The tart was great but the chocolate cake was gooey and not really spicey. By the time we left, the resaurant was completely full. We would definitely go back to Angele as there are other dishes we would like to try. ",5
 We were made to feel very special as we celebrated our wedding anniversary at this charming Napa Valley restaurant. The service was excellent and we were delighted to receive complimentary champagne to celebrate. The  food was delicious and we will be returning again and again. ,5
 we were placed in the back room next to loud guy at a neighboring table. I felt like I was in a dungeon at the front of a ship. Different experience had we been in the front room with more action and more excitement. Food was portioned extremely small for the price. The risotto and the cocktails were the only things to go back for. Priced too high! ,3
 We just love this place.  Outstanding food and served in a very comfortable outdoor patio overlooking the river.  Great choices on the menu and everything we tried is great. ,5
" Had a post new years brunch. Between my girlfriend and me, we enjoyed 2 drinks, the Pimm’s Cup and a house lemonade. The lemonade was outstanding and would order that again. Pimm's cup was good but not as good as the lemonade. For lunch we had a soup of the day, something with root veggies I believe. It wasn't that great but not bad. I had the Croque Madam which was really good and quite large as well. It was a great balance of flavor and textures. I would come here again. ",4
" We were there for New Year's Eve dinner, chose to sit at the bar, and Kevin, the bartender, was fantastic! Great guests seated next to us, started with champagne and  fantastic sweetbread appetizers, the bouillabaisse with Sancerre and flatiron steak with Puligny Montrachet, our respective entree's, were perfect, the energy and warmth of the restaurant are unique to this location, and it all stays that way due to the constant presence of Bettina Rouas, the owner, who is a treasure! ",5
" Bettina is brilliant. She is a master. The ambiance, service and fabulous food make this our 11th year in a row for celebrating the new year. If you haven't been...go! ",5
" I ordered a medium rare duck breast and it was over cooked. While the waiter offered to re-do my order I declined the offer b/c I did not want my husband's boulliabaise  to get cold,so I was given a free dessert. The problem was bigger than just the overdone breast, however.  There were just too many unnecessary tastes on the plate. Why fry a spinach ball, which was not tasty, when just a bit more sautéed spinach on the plate would have sufficed.  There was also a piece of something that tasted like salami on the plate. In sum, there were just "" too many notes"" on the plate.  We have dined here several times, and the recent two times I have found the same issue--last time it was the quail dish.   The service, however, was excellent. ",4
 Authentic and delicious. Foods you don't always see on menus even in nice French restaurants but with a napa valley twist. Worth the drive even if you aren't staying in napa. I felt like I was in Paris. ,5
" This is my second time. My first time was in Summer and I was outside. The waiter, Robert was great, the ambiance, everything went great, maybe I was lucky. This time it was ok, not bad but for the price around $40 with dessert I expect much more but still I can recommend it. ",3
" Of all the restaurants available to us in the Bay Area, this is one of our favorites.  We return again and again for the food and ambiance. ",5
" The customer service here is excellent, the food was great, it was a lovely Christmas Eve romantic dinner experience. ",4
" I have dined in the past and really loved everything I had. This time around I was a tad disappointed in the Bouliabaisse, which was not traditional, but not yummy. Our appetizers and my hisbands pork were delicious. I would avoid that dish. ",3
" The ambiance, the wine selection, and the cozy environment makes Angele a great choice for a date. Be sure she's a keeper though, as dinner will set you back a pretty penny. ",4
" We enjoyed a fantastic meal after a day of wine tasting.  The lobster appetizer and bass main were both absolutely phenomenal -- on par with the finest restaurants.  Wonderful, fresh ingredients, perfectly prepared and beautifully presented.  Service was top notch, and the atmosphere was rich and enjoyable.  The quintessential Napa experience. ",5
" We have been eating at Angele for years, and the restaurant has grown and improved with every year.  Service is now better than ever and excellent, especially with the manager checking on each table.  We enjoyed duck, pate maison, bouillabaisse, chicory salad, and loup de mer.  Everything was excellent, and I particularly enjoyed the chicory salad - one of my new favorites after eating it in Italy. ",4
" Great inventive pork belly with a pumpkin croquette, farrow, and pickled huckleberries. Pasta with white truffles (seldom enough shavings). Rare duck. Warm chocolate cake and unique flavored ice cream. ",5
" On our winter vacation to Napa we wanted a great place for the last night. We had reservations elsewhere but a winery host recommended this spot highly. I'm So glad we went. From bread to pot du creme, it was all perfect. I had an amazing crispy skin sea bass with forbidden rice. ",5
" Dinner after a show at Silo's was well executed. Onion soup, pate, and bouillabaisse were all well-prepared and well-presented.   Attentive service. ",4
 Celebrated a newly married couple here just the other night. Amazing food options and excellent service! We were a little chilly sitting right by the open doors on a cool night - perhaps a stand-alone heater for that table would have been nice. And it would have been VERY nice (and easier on our server) if this establishment would update their billing system so that we could have had separate checks for each couple. Splitting that large check 4 ways was complicated and kind of a bummer at the end of a really great evening. Because of this - I'm not sure I would recommend this place to groups! ,4
" First impressions - lively (but not deafening) yet relaxed atmosphere, busy restaurant and bar, large exposed wood beams and a large seasonal floral arrangement just inside the front door. Tables are well spaced. Easy to have a normal conversation while dining; no shouting or noise drowning out words. Steak tartare with country french bread and sweetbreads for appetizers. Our main courses: quail with lava beans and duck with brown rice and sautéed spinach. Beautifully presented. Delicate and wonderfully delicious flavors. Service was responsive, timely and friendly. One of the best meals we have had in quite some time. We will be going back soon. ",4
 A true bistro experience. Salads and brunch entrees were very good...somewhat unusual preparations of standard fare. Desserts were exceptional. Wines went well with food.  First time diner; will definitely be back ,4
" The vibe is more business-casual, which I appreciated. It's not stuffy nor pretentious, but their food could easily be pitted against ""those"" types of restaurants.  We started out with a cocktail - I recommend the Diane Lane if you like fruity drinks. It's vodka and Bunderberg blood orange soda with a sprig of rosemary and a slice of lime. Very refreshing! The cocktails were served in canning jars which, again, hearkened to the more casual feel of the restuarant.   We ordered appetizers - I had the ricotta maison - housemade ricotta which was very smooth and creamy, with more of a mascarpone texture. It was served with butternut squash balsamic marmalade and toasted country bread. I love butternut squash, and that marmalade was delicious! Not too sweet, so it didn't overpower the mellowness of the ricotta. I alternated spreading layers onto the toast and enjoyed every last bit of it!  My husband had the pate maison - pork and root vegetable pate with duck bacon, pickled vegetables, and toasted country bread. He cleaned his plate! He's a chef, and he described the pate as ""heaven,"" so there ya go...  For our entrees, I had the canard roti - sonoma duck breast, guanciale roulade, jasmine rice with duck confit, cirspy spinach, and persimmons. Everything was spectacular! The duck was perfectly moist and juicy with a bit of a smoky flavor. The crispy skin gave it a bit of an additional bacon flavor which was fantastic!  My husband had the longe de porc - suckling pig loin, crispy pork belly, brussels sprouts, yams, yukon gold potatoes, and chestnut cream. Once again, he cleaned his plate! I did get to try a piece of the pork belly, which was very good - juicy and tender, reminiscent of a very, very good piece of carnitas!  We shared the fruit tart for dessert, which was flaky, crispy, and delicious! I recommend it highly.  Our server was fantastic - everytime he passed our table he would check in on us; he was very knowledgable and helpful.  Two thumbs way up! ",5
" On time for our reservation, table ready. The wine list is wide, but way overpriced. Ordered a Pinot Noir for $70 that at $15 would be about right.  Service was attentive. Appetizer was the hihg of the night with properly cooked and tasty scallop. From there on same as an Applebee's. ",3
" Food was variable; when good, very good. Fish portions were way too very small.  special event wasn't even noted. ",2
" We are locals and hadn't been to Angele for a while.  The prices have increased quite a bit from when we were there last, but more importantly the food was average and the service was poor.    Our friend had the New York Steak.  He was so looking forward to it, but received a very small piece of meat.  What was on the plate was more bone marrow and beef belly.  Really??  My husband had scallops which were mediocre and the rice was very bland.  All in all, very disappointing.  We don't mind paying if the food is worth it.  This was not.  The service was sporadic and we had to finally get up and ask the hostess for our check and even then we had to wait again to have the payment picked up.    We won't be coming again.  There are so many other restaurants in town with better food and service. ",3
" You MUST have the sauteed clams. MUST. Every bite of the quail was like its own little universe of wonderfulness. The salmon special of the evening was spectacular. I'm running out of superlatives - but why talk about it when you can just EAT it.  Go, enjoy. Celebrate FINE food. ",5
 This is the second time we ate here.  My dish of Branzino was very tasty but  portion was a little small.  The surrounding vegetables were in a sauce of some kind that was delicious.  The vegetables were perfectly cooked but they were on the cool side.  My husband ordered a pork dish which he thought was a little tough but it too was very tasty.  Unlike many of the local restaurants the bottles of wine are very reasonably priced.  I will definitely come back to this restaurant because the food was so tasty I have to consider that maybe it was an off night for the kitchen or the server. ,4
" Was it the company? Was it the food? Was it the service? Was it the atmosphere? Yes, yes, yes, yes! ",5
" Food, service and ambiance are always consistent, innovative and wonderful.  We live in Napa and love going to Angele. ",4
" Made reservation with great expectations as Angele was on Top 100 restaurant list in San Francisco Chronical. Brought clients to entertain. The bar was very nice and bar servers were attentive however they charged us for more drinks than ordered. This was corrected immediately when brought to their attention. The restaurant is lovely. We had been out tasting during the day and this was later reservation so we were looking forward to our meal. We ordered a soup appetizer - cream of potato and leek. It was good but very thin without the usual richness. Our main courses came thereafter and we were all a bit surprised to see how little food was on our plates. 2 of us ordered the pork chop. This was the smallest, thinnest cut of pork chop I have ever seen. 3 bites, maybe 4. The steak was also ordered and it too was a slice of beef perhaps 3"" square and 1/2 - 3/4 "" thick. I was terribly  embarrassed as it was very apparent my clients were making an effort to enjoy the ""meal"". If the food preparation had been extraordinary I could understand but it was not at all. I would not recommend this restaurant. ",1
" Angele has a great menu of a variety of foods and drinks that are tasty and exquisitely presented. Though upscale, the service was down to earth. We had a wonderful meal of foods and tastes we would never think would ""fit"" together, but they really do! Drink concoctions with a tang, delectable salads and soups, and main courses that exceeded all expectations with service and wine pairing suggestions made this a wonderful dining experience. Leave room for dessert!! ",5
" This was our 2nd visit to Angele's.  We went to celebrate my daughter's birthday.  We were very disappointed.  Our meals were bland.  The amt of food provided was ""definitely"" not worth the price.  In a steak dish, there were only two small slices of steak on the plate.  Second, the service was horrible.  After our waiter took our order, he never returned to our table to see how we were doing during the evening!  He didn't remember to bring extra bread.  Known as a French restaurant, they played other ethic songs which was amusing.  When we asked for the bill, our waiter did not mention about celebrating my daughter's birthday (since I indicated the message on Opentable).  Lastly, they allowed owners to bring their dogs in the patio. ",3
" As a local Napa resident and food enthusiast I have been trying to hit all my restaurants on the bucket list. I wanted something close to home and Angele had a reservation. I brought a nice bottle of Pinot Noir and had an amazing meal. Shared two apps which we both very good. The entrees will also shared, sea bass &amp; bacon wrapped stuffed quail. The quail was the hit of the night as I couldn't stop eating my half. The flavors were just perfect. Who doesn't like bacon on anything....we had to have dessert which was nice. I prefer a chocolate dessert, we tried the almond tart. Overall, food was top notch and my server was very attentive. He knew when to approach the table. Highly recommended Angele for your next dining experience. ",4
" Angele was a very nice experience.  We had 6 people in a private room and the service was excellent.  The food was superb and the selections, although limited, were great.  Definitely would return. ",1
 Seated beside birthday group. Very noisy. Conversation impossible. Evening ruined! Staff unwilling to quiet noisy table. ,1
 Not worth the money! Should have gone somewhere else. ,2
" We live in Napa and often turn to Angele to celebrate our small or big occasions. The place never disappoints. Attentive, yet heartfelt service with excellent food and beverage choices in a great location. ",5
" Very pleasant ambiance, friendly and attentive service by delightful waiter.  The food, including seasonal salad, steak tartare, and pan-fried duck breast, was all excellent.  The only down side is the very high corkage charge - $25 is stupidly high. ",4
 An excellent restaurant in Napa.  The food is always outstanding and the service is great.  A very enjoyable experience every time time go. ,5
 Great food paired with great service. Definitely recommend the duck mousse to start and quail for the main course. ,4
" This was a wonderful dining experience. However, it is pretty expensive. ",5
" This is our special occasion spot. I ordered the sea bass, it was charred. Our waitress had a large party in the back area, and didn't pay as much attention to us, as in past experiences. ",3
" From the moment we walked in we were charmed.  Very comfortable spot with accommodating and enthusiastic service.  The food was wonderful from appetizer to dessert.  The quail dish was beautiful and delicious, and the scallops were excellent.  We will definitely go back! ",5
 Some more friends in town with us so another trip to what is becoming our favorite Napa restaurant.  Food was incredible and our server Hillary handled us with charm and knowledge. ,5
" At first our party of nine was seated at a small round table. We were elbow to elbow and after some resistance we were finally put out a larger table.  Our service was very slow and not very attentive. We waited an hour and a half for our entrées. Our drinks were often empty. Our waiter was sometimes nowhere in sight in a house manager did come around and she was very attentive. However, I felt like she was two steps behind in correcting his mistakes which significantly affected our dining experience.  Overall, our dining experience was poor. Some of the food was delicious but other items was clearly subpar. It was not worth the price. ",2
" Limited menu, good wine selection.  Food is delicious and beautifully presented.  Put this on your must list of places to go in Napa. ",5
" No matter where we try, Angele is only one of three restaurants in all of the Napa Valley that we return to - and we return a LOT. Seasonal, innovative, savory, and always filling we LOVE LOVE LOVE Angele and all of their amazing staff! ",5
 Angele exceeded our expectations. The feel was warm and chic at the same time. The french onion soup was the best I have tasted. The only disappointment was the autumnal salad. It was decomposed to the point where the flavors did not mix. This will be our go to place in Napa. ,5
" Reservation was easy to get on Sunday night. Our waiter was present  and  alert to our needs. He provided an update to the SF Giants vs SL Cardinal game.  Our meal was excellent however, the bass was a bit on the tiny side.  Our pork chop was cooked to medium, very juicy and lots of flavor. THe onion soup was empecable.  The dessert was delicious, too.  Worthy of returning.    One family's kids were screeming and running around the dining area (Put a leash on this). ",4
" My friend and I had a very nice lunch here.  They have a beautiful outdoor area and it's on the river.  If you are going to  eat in downtown Napa, this is a good choice.  We had an appetizer of home made ricotta and butternut squash jam which was very good.  I enjoyed my salad and the specialty cocktail.   Afterwards we had a snack at the chocolate store a few doors down and did a little shopping.  The service was very good.  I will definitely return again. ",4
 The food here has gone downhill. Yountville is way to close to settle for this.  I won't go on and on ! ,2
 Best scallops ever. All the food we ordered were over the top. We will be back ,4
" Food Exceptional, as was the service!  Had a wonderful evening ",5
" Beautiful location, service was OUTSTANDING, fun waiter, food was good, but not over the top.  I would definitely return.  The landscaping around the restaurant alone makes it worth a visit.  It was stunning.  I will happily return. ",4
 It was great the food very nice the staff and the desert watermelon sorbay was the best ,5
" I live in Napa and have had great experiences at Angele, until Sat night. ",2
" Extensive and varied menu; excellent wine list.  Personable service from entering at front desk to evenings end.  My ""go to"" Napa restaurant. ",4
" This country-French restaurant was perfect from start to finish. The French onion soup and oysters with ""mignonette"" were wonderful appetizers. Our table of four all selected ""Salmon Roti"" served with fresh corn polenta, turnips, carrots and a whimsical ""corn dog"", a mini corn on the cob battered and fried.  Our server's recommendations for wines were spot-on.  Definitely will return. ",4
" We love this restaurant. Food was amazing service was great and attentive, we were there with a party of six and pretty much tried everything on the menu. Hats off to the chef! ",5
" We had a great dinner here.  There were 8 of us and the food was really great.  Right downtown Napa, with outdoor seating along the river.  Really great scene and though we were a group, you could have a nice romantic dinner there. ",4
" At the suggestion of the concierge at our hotel I booked Angele's restaurant. What a great dinner and ambience. Our waitress made excellent suggestions off the wine list and was most attentive throughout dinner. The place was quite busy for Thursday night and the main dining room was full and I thought very noisy. I was delighted when we were directed to a table for 2 in the small dining area which only had 3 tables. We were at the window and enjoyed watching the kayakers make their way down the Napa River until it grew dark. I had the potato leek soup and the wild salmon dish while my wife had the baby lettuce salad and the sea scallops. Both were delicious! If you are ever in/near Napa, definitely try Angele's. You'll be happy you did! ",5
 We had a delightful evening at Angele.  The service was unbelievable and the food was delicious!  I had read a few less than perfect reviews but everything was perfect!  :) ,5
 We had a great evening at Angele.  We sat on the patio with our small dog.  Our server was very good as was everything we ordered.  We plan to return next week. ,4
 Good eating and very good service! Good eating and very good service! ,3
" As a local this restaurant sometime slips off my radar, but not anymore! 4 of us had dinner there Saturday night. The Service was excellent,  &amp; professional.  The menu was so interesting &amp; the Side dishes were  as exciting as the center of the plate entree. The mustard crusted pork chop with braised beets &amp; cabbage was a perfect marriage of flavors. The plate presentations were so beautiful we all felt compelled to take a picture prior to eating them. The duck liver mousse w/grilled bread is an appetizer I can't wait to order again. Then Fench spritz cocktail with tangerine juice was the perfect start to the evening &amp; The banana tart was the perfect way to end the meal! Angele is now at the top of the list of my dining radar! ",4
" Napa French bistro fare; go for the ambience, the burgeoning Napa River redevelopment scene; but the food won't elevate you to the next level. Service is great. ",3
" Great tasting food, well presented in a nice environment. ",5
 After many visits to Napa we finally made it to Angele.  Great location right on the River.  The staff was very attentive without  going overboard.  Food was great and lots of choices.  We were worried that there wouldn't be enough variety for our group but that definitely wasn't the case. It was pretty noisy but we could still have a conversation but a loud one. ,4
 Winding down after a fab day on the wine trail. ,5
 Food was awesome  And service was very good  Nice place for couples ,5
" We were looking for a French bistro menu, lunch menu had just the thing, steak pomme frits, but no where to be found on the dinner menu.  We asked and viola got our wish. ",3
" In the last couple years Angele has done a spectacular job updating their menu seasonally and every time we visit we are greeted with fantastic new items.  Always the highest quality ingredients paired with the light, but not shy, hand of their chef makes every bite a joy.  Don't even hesitate to make a reservation here! ",5
" It was ""good"" as my rating indicates...nothing to shake a stick at for the price. ",3
 The bistro-like ambiance does not warrant the rather high prices! ,3
" An absolutely fabulous dining expirience. Every course of the Chef's tasting menu was off the charts. A perfect romantic dining expirience. Try this place, you will not be disappointed. ",5
" We dine at Angele's in Napa every time we visit and have always enjoyed our meals. This time, it was exceptionally good. Fresh. Creative. Perfectly prepared. Beautiful night. It all made for a perfect meal. ",5
 Liver mousse was great.  My sister thought her cocktail was undrinkable (they took it off the bill) and switched to wine. Otherwise..good but not exceptional.  They DID SEAT US EARLY which we appreciated but the waiter wasn't interested in us at all. ,3
" We hadn't been to Angele in years so we thought we would give it a try!  We won't be waiting years to return! Although the patio is fabulous, we ate inside for the first time and the room is so lovely!  Very charming!  Our dinner was delicious!  My husband and I shared some oysters, followed by a melon salad.  I was still talking about the fresh flavors the next morning!  I had a seared tuna appetizer for my main course, the tuna was slightly overcooked but still enjoyable.  My husband had the steak, which was cooked perfectly.  We would gladly recommend Angele.  Wonderful setting, friendly service and a delicious meal!  Perfect! ",4
" Amazing food (except the pork that was really dry), very pleasant atmosphere, very nice waiter. Would love to come back! ",5
 We went for our 26th Anniversary dinner and was so pleasantly suprised when they brought us each a glass of champagne to toast.  So sweet and we loved our table by the window in the small intimate back room.  The meal was wonderful from the ahi appetizer to the Duck con fit and the scallops.  Left feeling satisfied and happy.  Thank you again and we will be back soon!!! ,5
 We had the most fabulous experience at Angele.  They went out of there way to accommodate are every need.  It was a very relaxing &amp; beautiful day to be sitting overlooking the Napa River ,5
" the wine prices are completely over the top. Enjoy the food, but bring your own wine. ",4
 Pork belly with the duck egg was amazing! The quail was fantastic! ,4
 Best outdoor dining in Napa! Great food and super friendly ,5
" Our anniversary was the night after the recent Napa earthquake and Angele had just opened for business after their cleanup. The restaurant was packed with lots of happy people. Our server, Hillary made our evening so special. Her appetizer and wine suggestions were perfect, as was her upbeat attitude. We started with the decadent duck pate with fig jam followed with entrees of seared scallops over forbidden rice and the best chicken I've ever had! No room for dessert after such a lovely meal. We usually sit on the terrace but decided for the cozy but vibrant dining room inside. Angele is a special place and a favorite of locals like ourselves. ",5
" My husband and I were looking forward to our dinner at Angele.  It did not disappoint.  The table was perfect, the heaters were on and everything from drinks to apps to dinners and dessert was excellent.  I tried the Diane Lane and it was heavenly.  Husband's was a martini.  He had oysters and I had heirloom tomatoes....both were excellent.  Duck for me (something I was looking forward to)...excellent.  He had pork chop also great.  The wine was from one of our favorite Vinyards--Celani Family--and it was very reasonably priced.  Dessert was pot au crime with a glazed lavender donut.  It turned out unexpectantly to be our last night in Napa because we were awakened with the earthquake!  Wowza.  Still, a nice memory. ",5
" Angele is always special. Great good, great service, great view, great people. What's not to like!! ",5
" We have always enjoyed Angele, but we cringe when we get the waiter who fancies himself an entertainer.  He interjects himself into conversations at the table, is way too personal and just needs to tone it down in a big way.  Perhaps the restaurant would be kind enough to seat us in a different section upon our next visit.  Otherwise, go &amp; enjoy! ",3
" It was so lovely. The waiter, host, and manager all made everyone feel welcome. It was my five year anniversary so we paid for the five course tasting menu. We ended up getting six dishes, all of which were exquisite. Definitely a fancy restaurant, but totally worth it. ",5
" Angele is a place that changes chefs every two years (or so it appears). The current Top Hat is a Chef Rogelio Garcia, whose food is rather solid in a spirited and interesting take on otherwise a very classic French inspired menu. ",4
" On a beautiful sunny day my wife and I sat outside under the umbrella and enjoyed a wonderful lunch of grilled steak, macaroni and cheese, tender heirloom tomatoes and a fruity sorbet. The warm bread and butter are always an attraction. This place is perfect and the staff tries hard to make it a good time. The fryer was broken so no French fries but that was not a big deal with so many other choices. Make a reservation because it is a popular spot. ",5
" Very accommodating, loved the food, service was amazing. ",4
" We have eaten here many times.  While our waiter was a bit absent-minded this time, we still had a lovely time.  Highly recommend this place! ",4
" Sometimes it is just perfect.  The staff just knew what we wanted, wine, food, conversation. It was first time but they made us feel like regulars. ",5
 have eaten there many times and one of our favorite restaurants in Napa Valley ,4
 Angele always has my table waiting.  The hostess is very accommodating and seems sincere in her wish to please the customer.  Wait staff very good.  Food presentation outstanding and tasty.  Never fails to please.  It is a nice touch that the owner makes rounds and checks on all the tables. ,4
" Excellent steak Tartare (available in 4 oz and 8 oz portions.) The beef is chopped rather than run through a grinder and served with a nice frisee salad and crostini. Ratatouile, heirloom tomato salad, stuffed baby potatoes and Croque Madame were all very good. The house red is a 2011 Rhone and worked well with all our dishes. Desserts ranged from meh to outstanding. The chocolate bread pudding got the meh! The (house made?) chocolate ice cream was one of the best we'd ever tasted. A stone-fruit tart was very good but I'd like to have tasted more of the fruit.  We had pleasant outdoor seating, surrounded by flowery gardens. We did not go inside so can't talk about that. ",4
 We were introducing friends to Angele's even though we had only been there once before but were very impressed. We were given out door seating which was great except that the wind was blowing so it was a little chilly. The food was excellent and our waiter was fantastic as was all the staff. They have a wonderful wine and cocktail list to choose from.  Make your reservation early it fills up fast. We would definitely return. ,5
" This is one of the finest restaurants in Napa.  When we arrived, I was greeted with birthday wishes from our hostess and server.  A very gracious gesture.  The service was impeccable, friendly, knowledgeable and warm.  The food was outstanding.  I had the sole with a creamy risotto and my boyfriend had the lasagna which he thoroughly enjoyed.  Everything about this restaurant is top notch. ",4
" This is a great restaurant on all counts. The ambience is wonderful, unlike anything else you will find in the valley. It is less fancy, not contrived, but carefully tended and thoughtfully executed. Food and wind are just right. ",5
" Second time this month.  Last time I had the Faux Filet which was delicious.  This time the Canard Rôti which was moist, tender and flavorful.  I will get it again.  My wife again had the Tartare de Boeuf which she just loves.  We saw several other dishes, including the Coquilles Saint-Jacques went want to try so we will definitely be back.  Food is delicious, beautifully presented by personable friendly staff.  Reasonable prices, good wine list. ",5
" I chose this restaurant based on some research and it was confirmed by the concierge at our table. It was a very cool little restaurant at the end of town on the river. It is an old boathouse, so the wooden beams and quaint feel are a very nice touch. Food was excellent, well prepared, described, and presented. Great seating options both inside and outside. Would definitely go back. ",5
 Always a delicious meal to be had at Angele!  Thanks for always making us feel special! ,5
 Angele is one of our favorite restaurants in the Napa Valley. It's right on the River in downtown Napa and we love it. ,5
" My wife and I had heard really good things about Angele's and wanted to try it. I got the salmon with a side of potatoes. My wife got a salad with goat cheese (I think) with a side of soup. The best part of mine was the potatoes, the rest was alright. Nothing to write home about. My wife didn't care for the soup and the salad was fairly plain as well. I also can't remember the last time I was charged $8 for sparkling water. I'll make my own at home next time. We didn't have a bad experience here, just hoping for a little more for the amount of money we paid. Kind of plain. ",2
 Lovely setting. We keep thinking about the sole dish. Creative menu. Beautifully prepared food. Just delicious. Attentive to our friends' special dietary needs. Probably one of the best restaurants in Napa. ,5
" Great atmosphere, great food, great service, great patio....what else can one ask for when touring Napa wineries? The great place to end the day ",4
" Great restaurant for both indoor and outdoor dinning.  Fun Bar, Great food, and very welcoming.   Always a favorite for local or guests staying at the Hotel.   We will be back soon! ",4
" The food was only average. Nothing special, and it was barely warm when served. Very expensive and not warranted ",2
" Went on recommendation of others and was delighted by the experience.  Excellent food, top notch service, beautiful presentation.  Reasonably priced wine list.  We intend to return ",3
" A group of friends spent 5 nights in Napa, dining at a few of the well known restaurants. Angele was, hands down, the best food and service of the entire trip. This was the 3rd time that I have been to this restaurant and it never fails to provide an outstanding meal. With all the Napa Valley choices, I will put this restaurant at the top of my ""must visit"" list every time. Compliments to the chef and his well trained staff! ",5
 Excellent place and food; great wine list. Accmodating staff. ,5
" We enjoyed a perfect Saturday Quikbrunch here in what appears to be a gem of a French bistro newly opened.  We three had fish and chips (cooked to perfection), mussels (lovely sauce), frites (heavenly) and lip-smacking pate. The cocktails, wine and service was world class.  This restaurant deserves its' all star rating.  We can't wait to return for dinner. ",5
 A spot of France in Napa.  Food well prepared and efficiently served.  Staff always available and personable to create a delightful dining experience.  Host always at the reception desk with a ready smile. ,5
" This is becoming our favorite place.  Eating on the patio is wonderful.  The cocktail menu is inventive and fun.  The food is what one hopes for in a French restaurant with the easy going ambiance of Napa.  The combination of food quality, decor, and service makes this a wonderful place to entertain out of town guests or romantic couples.  We have also taken children here, and if they are well behaved, the place is also appropriate ",5
 Love the place... dear memories ,4
" Enjoyed wonderful lunch on outdoor terrace overlooking Napa River.  Very relaxed atmosphere, very good service.  Food portions ample and highly recommend for lunch. ",4
" $105 for a 5-course chef tasting plus wine pairing is extremely hard to come by, especially in wine country.  The 5-course tasting menu was in actuality a 6-course tasting menu and it was FANTASTIC!  Our entire table left extremely happy and with our bellies very full.  The stars of the night were definitely the cauliflower soup and the bacon-wrapped quail.  Do not pass up on the tasting menu - you're in for a real treat! ",4
 We had made reservations on open table requesting a nice table outside. This was done 3 days ahead of time. We got a table in a corner by the bar/kitchen seemingly. Pretty sure they gave my table away to a regular or promised it to someone else. After much fuss we managed to get them to hold a table for us outside when people left. We got moved outside after about 30 minutes. We had to look for the waiter most of the time and flag him down. The food was about 50% satisfactory. Half the dishes were good the other half nothing special. ,2
 We have eaten here many times and it was always very good. This was  a very poor experience. Three guests of our party of six ordered bass which came dry and tasteless. I had duck which was overcooked and tasteless. Even the steak was poorly done. None of the items came off the check although they were brought to the waiters attention. Even the one dessert we had was not compt. A poor experience overall and very disappointing from one of our previously favorite places in the Napa Valley. ,1
 Food is always awesome.  The new chef is fantastic and his offering were super. ,4
" We come here often and always have a good meal.  We bring a bottle of wine, and then pick our food to go with the wine.  A very delightful evening. ",5
" Went to Angele's for my birthday, based on a review by Michael Bauer.  couldn't have been happier.  Chose the tasting menu- puree of corn soup,, heirloom tomato salad, the appetizer ""lasagna"", duck, cheese plate and an incredible coffee pot au lait and lavender flavored doughnut. Each course was perfectly prepared and presented.  The soup was to die for, the heirloom tomatoes perfectly sweet and ripe, the ""lasagna"" melt in your mouth, the duck perfectly cooked, etc.  The wine pairings were perfect, and the extra champagne to celebrate my birthday a nice treat. Costly, but totally worth it for a special occasion.  We will be back to try brunch and lunch. ",5
" We saw that Angele was mentioned in the Bay Area Top 100 and we were not disappointed! A window side seat allowed us to watch the flood tide on the Napa River as we enjoyed the excellent food and service. We now have a favorite eaterie in Napa, with easy access, followed by a delightful stroll along the river in this rejuvenated part of the city of Napa. ",4
" The food was wonderful, great atmosphere for conversation and service was excellent, with special attention from the bartender. ",5
 Food and service not to be outdone.  Very enjoyable! ,4
 I go to Angele every time I go to Napa....Love sitting outside.The one problem was the hostess looked at my reservation but did not check me in so I got a message from Open Table that I did not show up for my reservation.I think this has been resolved now...The staff was very pleasant....will continue to  go to there. ,5
" So many wonderful places to eat and yet this was one of our favorites in Napa.  Quaint and friendly with amazing food and wine. We felt like we were in Provence. If you're in Napa, don't miss this little gem along the river. ",4
" Took my parents to Angele for their 45th wedding anniversary celebration. We had a great time. Food was amazing, service was good, ambience was average. We all enjoyed our food very much and price was reasonable. Mac &amp; Cheese was to die for!!! ",4
 We just returned from Paris and we wanted to continue to have fabulous food from France.  We were not disappointed.  My husband fell hard for duck confit while there and did not want to have a bad experience.  I read all the reviews and hoped for the best.  We were so amazed at the great meal we had.  He had the sweetbread as first course and recommends them highly.  Duck was perfect.  I had the pork chop and would definitely order it again.  Dessert was also very good.  Creme brulee for me and chocolate mousse for him.  We will be back!!! ,5
" When you spend $100 on brunch and only have 1 drink each, the standards are high. Food was average, service was slow and there are a lot of better options in the area. Skip Angele and go to Grace's table. Not only was the food better, it was way more appropriately priced and the staff was more attentive despite having 10 times more diners. ",2
 Fun atmosphere with fantastic food. Spent a long no kid weekend for our wedding anniversary and this was our favorite spot. The service is great and the food was spectacular. Highly recommend as the spot to go in Napa.  ,5
" Wonderful spot. Booked the reservation 2 weeks prior. This particular weekend was when BottleRock Napa was going on. The staff accommodated our request to be on the patio, overlooking the Napa River. Great service, attentive but not pushy. The food was fabulous, especially the oysters. My wife's salmon was done perfectly and my duck breast was as well. The only negative, which we have with nearly all Napa restaurants is the $25 corkage fee.  We purchased a bottle there instead. But having some great wines of our own, which we preferred, would have made for an even better experience.  ",4
" There is no question that the food at Angéle is good, but is it good enough to warrant the prices they charge?  I can think of a number of restaurants in the Bay Area, including Napa, where the food and service are as good, but the prices less gouging. ",4
 They gave us very special attention for our 42nd honeymoon. ,5
" From the tuna to the beef tartar, to the scallops to the banana gratin...everything was excellent, including TIM, our server. Great food, great service, great ambiance.  ",5
" Lovely food. Great wine list. Lovely, unique speciality drinks. Our dinner was not enjoyable however because the noise level was impossible. I don't know that I would repeat the experience. ",3
" 1. shared heater for two tables, because the other table complained in side of restaurant, they never asked our table. 2 of us were cold, heater was sut off.  2. Pouched tune salad was on menu but it was actually canned and waiter openly admitted it. ",1
" The food was amazing. We started with the steak tartar (the small plate, which was more than enough for two). It was rich and decadent. I had the scallops and my guy had the quail with green chorizo for our main plates. Both were outstanding. The scallops were perfectly cooked and buttery. My guy is in no way a foodie (he's a meat and potatoes man), but he loved his quail... and pretty much everything about our dinner. The quail was juicy, the chorizo was wonderfully seasoned and the mushroom lasagna that came with it was fantastic. If only we had room for dessert. We both had local white wines, which were fab. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on this menu. One note about the atmosphere, it was beautiful inside, but very loud. ",5
 Lately I have been dining here again and everything has been consistent and delicious.  Great brunch and perfect and really only place to enjoy outdoor dining in Napa with great quality of food. ,5
" We had a wonderful meal at Angele. The highlight was my green garlic risotto, which was fabulous. Also, our service was outstanding. I should also mention that we brought our kids, and they were nice enough to offer them a couple items that are not on the menu. ",5
" Eating at Angele is always a wonderful experience. The food is amazing, service is fast and attentive, and the atmosphere is perfect. Angle has a lovely indoor space, but also a gorgeous outdoor riverfront eating area for open air eating. There is a full bar and great hang-out vibe too. Excellent! ",5
" liked the ambiance quite a bit, especially for dinner. romantic. were seated promptly at our reservation time by a friendly hostess. had a cocktail to start and was very good...good list. for wine started with a glass of Brown Cab 95 that had gone bad. replaced for us but probably should have comped at that point. service was ok after bad glass of wine. food was brought way to quickly, seemed as though we were being rushed. probably would have been better for business as well, as we may have had another glass at $16. salad and two entries brought within a total of 10 minutes....a bit too fast for a fine dining establishment. food was quite good but portion size was tiny. I would recommend but with caveats as the food was good. ",3
" The nice thing about brunch at Angele's is that there is a very nice selection of non-traditional small plates, for those of us who don't really care for pancakes, waffles etc. We had a lovely Sunday lunch there, the highlights of which were the pea soup, fresh oysters, artichoke salad, pizzetta, steak tartare and steak Parmentier. Everything was well-prepared, and ever so fresh and tasty. The service was discrete but efficient. All 4 of us (of different nationalities and culinary backgrounds) were very satisfied. ",4
" Lunch for 4. Good selection of wines, and excellent bistro menu. The service was excellent. Warmer weather will allow them to open their outside dining, giving you a pleasant view of the Napa River. ",4
 Recently for a business lunch during a stressful time I visited Angele Food ambience and service made it a great choice. Lots of choices and nice non alc bev selection as well as small but quality by the glass list Easy parking easy to find I look forward to returning with friends ,4
" Great food, presentation was awesome! Great service. Just in town for 2 days and so glad we had dinner there. We sat outside right by the heater. ",5
" I recently had brunch at Angele with my son and his girlfriend having not eaten there for a couple of years. The ambience was unbeatable on a lovely sunny day and the staff delightful. Brunch was mediocre. Tasteless duck confit, dry and flavorless fried Cornish game hen ( the cook forgot to bread the chicken so if was fried without a coating) and equally dry and rather unpleasant sausage stuffed waffles. The only decent dish was the croque madame. We won't be going back. ",2
 The entire meal was fantastic. Shaved black truffle everywhere. Marvelous. When I am in Napa I will come back again and again. I literally wanted to order a small plate of every dish on the menu. ,5
" This was our first time here with another couple. Honestly, I picked it because everybody else was booked the night we went. Staff was very friendly, left us alone to enjoy our conversation. Food looked great, tasted okay. I ordered the duck, it was warm but not hot. The squid app looked better than it tasted. I would not order again and I love squid. Dessert was unbelievably good! The banana dish is what we split. If I would have just ordered that and had my wine I would have been fine. Napa has a ridiculous amount of great restaurants and chefs so the pressure is always on to impress patrons. Angele was solid, but there's better for the money we spent if you can get a reservation and plan accordingly. ",4
" Our first time to Angele. Great atmosphere. A little disappointed in the limited wine choices by the glass, but the food made up for that. I had the Beef Cheeks, undoubtedly one of the best beef dishes I've had in some time. Service was great and the restaurant had a wonderful lively atmosphere about it, wold go back in a heart beat. Great location, it was a little chilly to dine out on the Patio, but I can imagine its great when the weather permits. We will go back next time we're in Napa. ",4
 had a very nice meal here. Last minute change of time as well as number of people didn't throw them off and they accomodated us and we had an excellent meal. ,4
 This was one of the best meals I've had in years. Divine! ,5
 Our wine country go to; love the quiet of the river and the relaxed environment; it's like dining at a French cafe; no rush and no worries ,5
" This is my first time dining here for Brunch and wasn't disappointed with the menu nor the service. All of the flavors are delicate though the duck confit was quite savory which complemented the rose wine. The flavorful pate and desserts (pudding and banana gratin) supplemented a wonderful dining experience. A big plus, the waiter wasn't overly attentive (seen without been seen) to the table and let us relax and enjoy the day. ",5
" Perfect evening, nice service, very well designed food, from the safe (mac and cheese) to the daring (sweetbreads). Well-portioned entrees and reasonable by the glass list - there was a 2005 Napa cab, not just their ""house"" wines. Interesting cocktails to start the meal. ",4
" We had the sturgeon and the truffle risotto along with two creative and tasty appetizers. The food was spectacular and the service was excellent. Angele has become one of the most consistently outstanding restaurants in the Napa Valley, even though the experience remains understated and cozy. This is not the over the top experience that you find at the French Laundry, Meadowwood or La Toque, but it is certainly one of the best and most interesting places to eat in the wine country. ",5
" This restaurant came highly recommended from a number of venues (books, hotel, wineries, websites, etc) and it certainly lived up to the hype. The setting is fantastic, sitting right along the Napa River, with a fantastic outdoor seating area. The menu is creative and has a little something for everyone, however, there is really only one thing you need to know about this place: Bacon wrapped, chorizo-stuffed quail (for pork-product lovers, that's pork product on the outside and more on the inside for good measure)...I don't care what else you think you like on this menu - order this. If only I could find a way for them to ship it to Boston.... ",5
" Where do the locals go in Napa, to celebrate A 60th, a wedding, a Holiday or a Friday? Angele' .... Why? Its everything you want in your night out The French touch, old river house, great staff, a real bar Great bread! And then the Menu! Its so interesting And exciting, even the non sharer wants to share Perfect cooked beets. Scallops presented in a pesto, that did not Overwhelm!! Great Date Night !! Thanks for the memories Angele' ",5
 We had a wonderful lunch on the deck. The pâté was superb! Steak and pomme frites and croquet Madame were excellent as was the pear tarte. Service was impeccable. Highly recommended. ,5
 Met for lunch with a co-working on the outdoor patio-great space - had the sweet bread app that was amazing - entree's were perfect for lunch - tried to eat dessert too - butterscotch pudding was extremely tasty - Enjoyed a bottle of Chappellet Signature Cab which is always outstanding. Not much I would change other than the table for two was a bit small but we were warned by the hostess so not complaining just a comment. ,5
 The team here keeps me coming back time and time again. Their food and cocktail menus are impressive and the service is friendly and top notch. ,4
 I have been to Angele several times and it just keeps getting better. Our server suggested the potato leek soup which we did and it was superb. I also had the fish and chips which was not your usual made from cod These were made fro tilapia which made them very light and tasty.  Will go back to Angele many more times. ,5
" Amazing food, great ambiance and exceptional service. We couldn't have asked for more! ",5
" I was very disappointed in the service and food. We ordered an appetizer that was finished then left there for an hour and half before we got our entree. The wait staff approached us and we said we were done. Then she went missing, only to have us flag her down to ask for our food, which then took another 45 minutes to come. When the entree came, it was flavorless and flat. The scallops were overcooked and rubbery. A major disappointment since there's so many wonderful places to eat in Napa. After hearing rave reviews about the restaurant, I just hope it was an off night. ",1
" Angele continues to get better and better. We have eaten here many times, and it shows that they are working to improve food and service. We needed a quiet table, and we were given a lovely table in a small room in the back. All of our dinners were wonderful - Pate de Campagne appetizer, Beet Salad, Gnocchi, Mustard Crusted Pork Chop and Scallops. We also had some good wines from a French Sancerre to a California Pinot. All together a lovely and enjoyable evening, thanks to Angele. ",4
 friendly service. delicious French classics; especially onion soup and sweetbreads. ,5
" Angele, as always came through. Excellent meal, excellent service and wonderful atmosphere. A perfect evening. ",5
" The service was outstanding for our party of 5, three of whom were visiting from China. Menu is creative, with some brunch standards and some twists. One twist I didn't care for was the fact that the day's special ""bread"" was a huckleberry muffin, each of which cost $3.00. For brunch at a high-end restaurant, should this not be part of the package? To be sure, they were delicious, but it sullied the experience. All other aspects were quite nice, and the lunch was a nice break from a day of viewing art and drinking wine. ",4
" My wife and I were in Napa spending the afternoon enjoying wine tasting and eachothers company. We wanted to cap off a great day with a nice sit down restaurant and found Angele per the recommendation of several others in the area. It was a very nice restaurant with a great view of the river and a perfect way to end the evening. We enjoyed a glass of wine an appetizer and a nice meal. My wife had the scallops, which were absolutely great and I had the risotto. Both dishes were very good and would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for great food, a beautiful setting and great atmosphere for client meetings, romantic eats or great atmosphere for a friendly meal. ",4
 The food and the restaurant was great. The Hostess saved the night! Our waiter lacked attention and did nothing to create a positive dining experience. ,3
" I have been coming to this restaurant for years - usually for the burger and/or the French onion soup. This time however we both decided to try something different. My husband had the eggs Benedict and I had the fish and chips. My husband didn't like his dish, but was starving so he ate it - he said he had had better eggs Benedict at Denny's. I loved the fish and chips. The fish was sole instead of the usual cod. The batter was light and perfect for the fish. It wasn't greasy at all. And there were enough fries for 4 people. ",4
" Angele is handicapped by its small physical space, but the people make the most of what they have. It is consistently a great restaurant!!! ",5
" Food was quite good, well-prepared, and appealing to the eye and palate. Among other things, we had the steak tartare, which I have had extensively in travels to France. Good, but needs some tweaking to be great. Very disappointed with our waitperson. In short, disinterested and cold, which is a turn-off and not the attitude a person in a ""service industry"" position should have. I was a bit taken aback when the individual that introduced himself as the ""sommelier"" opened and poured our Red Rhone wine in an incorrect white wine glass. Granted the wine was brought by us, we still paid the $20 corkage fee, which I think should include the correct glass for the wine....particularly in Napa and a by a ""sommelier."" ",3
" We celebrated my husband's birthday and we've always liked French food, so we chose Angele. Wonderful choice and a great deal, as we opted for the $80 five course tasting menu, and enjoyed a sun choke soup, beet and carrot salad, squid mousse appetizer, thinly sliced filet mignon, and butterscotch pudding. The chef even threw in a cheese plate for us. We originally had a 6:15pm reservation, and wanted to dine earlier, which the hostess was able to move up for us. The restaurant is offers indoor and outdoor seating, with a view of the river. We sat inside and the wood decor made it warm and welcoming. Plenty of parking too! Happy to recommend Angele and hope to return soon! ",5
" We didn't think Angele could get any better, but the food, incredible staff and tip-top wine list had us talking about it all weekend! The sommelier treated us to a bottle of a very special wine he had been able to procure only a case of, a FANTASTIC, knock down drag out Santenay. Truffles are a special feature on the menu right now and the game hen was just mouth-wateringly to die for. Squid Appetizer a MUST, porcbelly - just eat it and know heaven for a few moments!  And don't forget the Pear Collins. You're in Napa, but mixology offers so many delights - and this is a wonderfully refreshing one. Incredible Parisian atmosphere, great lighting, perfect sound level. Romantic. Just perfect! ",5
 Good meal. High noise level so very difficult to talk. Service was excellent ,4
 It was good.  We didn’t order their specialty so  not sure about those.  The food was good not amazing. ,4
 Great experience . Outside dining  . Wonderful music. Excellent service from Rachel and great food at a reasonable price.  One of our favorite places to dine. ,5
 Reserved thru OpenTable and got a call confirming my reservation where she said we prob won’t get a table outside per original request and that we had a 2 hour limit on the table (we just have a party of 2) so that was a little off-putting. Otherwise the food was good but not great. Guy on guitar was fantastic!! Cooper our waiter was good. ,4
 Amazing place. Great vibe. ,5
" Great food and lively atmosphere. Everyone enjoyed their meal. Lou, good energy and lots of TVs ",4
 This place always seems to be hopping.  Once your seated the staff is attentive and you don't feel rushed or crowded.   Always start with pretzel bread with cheese dipping sauce.  Fried chicken was the number one choice in our group.   I had the Garden Kale and it was very good and filling... maybe too filling we did not have room for monkey bread ,5
" Great food, drink selection, and service. A great place to show appreciation of my colleges in a fun atmosphere. ",5
 Not good. Disappointed at the slow service and my entree was not good. Nor did they care. First and last time. ,1
 Service and food was excellent. We had a wonderful time celebrating my wife’s birthday. ,5
" I had been to lunch here and found it very good. The kale salad with smoked salmon and the soft pretzel balls with cheese dip are favorites. On a Friday evening, however, the place is too crowded and noisy. It was impossible to have a conversation after the live music started ",2
 The best item on the menu fried chicken came out with one wrong order and was greasy and tough like it had been twice in the fryer. Three orders and no one finished it. Loud and expensive for the quality ,2
 Zherr was a great hostess  love the food and service ,5
 Awesome place and great every time. You can't go wrong here. ,5
" We had a greet time. Sat outside under the heaters which was heat but a little noisy and felt like I was sitting so far away from my husband at the table. And did feel we were sitting so close to both parties of people on both sides of us to where we didn’t really feel we could just take the time to talk over dinner. But other than that, the food and service were great. ",5
 Another great experience here. Sat outside on a cooler day and it was perfect. Great service and the food was amazing!! ,5
" A friend recommended this place and he was spot on. Great food, cool atmosphere and top notch service. Our group tried the Ribs, fried chicken and Salmon. Each were prepared as if this place specialized in only that dish. I also ordered the Seared Ahi salad and we asked for a separate dish so we could share. The server offered to split it up for us without missing a beat. Definitely worth the try. ",5
" Fish and chips. Fish an A, chips so salty inedible, Meatloaf bland and tasteless. table service excellent ",3
 Great restaurant near Fashion Square. One of our best meals during our Scottsdale vacation. ,5
 The service was good and em they were attentive to my birthday however it was very load and too dark to read the menu ,3
 Patio was wonderful. Not too loud ,4
 We had a delicious antipasto with wine. Very nice! ,4
" Cold old coffee. Slow food. My aunts food came out 5-10 minutes after everyone else's food. It was embarrassing since it's the first opportunity in years for me to take her out and she watched everyone else eat. She came to visit from 2000 miles away and this is where I took her for a treat. I'm not sure why this place has all the hype.  She had a salad by the way. Not exactly time consuming, ",3
" Food served cold. Entrees delivered to table separately to five guests over span of 15 minutes. The elements are there for good food, but the service is a problem. ",2
" We had the Caesar salad and substituted chicken for the fried shrimp.  We got a bowl full of dressed lettuce and kale.  No croutons, no chicken.  They brought out a chicken breast on a separate plate for us to add.  It definitely wasn't a typical caesar and felt like a very expensive bowl of lettuce and kale w/ dressing.  Nothing special AT ALL!  The next night I had the most AMAZINGLY beautiful, tasty and colorful salad at Dough Bird.  There!!! Is where I'll be going next time I'm in town! ",2
 Culinary Dropout is one of my go-to restaurants in Scottsdale! I always go for good food. ,5
 stick to drinks and appetizers...Chicken was dry.  Chili not so good. ,4
" average food at best, there are much better options. Noisy and waited for table after reserved time even though there were empty tables. ",2
 What a great place for dinner!  The menu was super and the service was first class!!! ,5
" The food and service was very good, however, it was very challenging to have a conversation with others in the party if they were not sitting right next to you due to the acoustics in the restaurant. ",4
" Had a friend recommend this place for my girlfriend and I as we were in holiday from Denver.  Loved the atmosphere, food and our server was fantastic! ",5
 Best go-to restaurant in fashion square area. Pretzel fondue is a must. ,5
" Definitely NOT a place to take out of town guests.  The service was DEPLORABLE and while I can abide poor service if the food and drinks are divine, CD fell short.  The food was only mediocre.    Service issues included a server who kept pulling up her tube top!! ...as she handled our food!?   She also kept getting lost!  Never checked back on us, thus couldn't even get drinks to make the experience tolerable!    Overall ~ FAIL ",1
" We went here for my sons graduation celebration from ASU. We had a great night! We were seated outside which had a great ambiance. Food  and service were GREAT! The restaurant Even supplied my son with a complimentary dessert to celebrate. Best part, It is was so nice that it was not  too loud so we could have easy conversation and have many laughs together. Highly recommend. Thank you Culinary Dropout for a wonderful night! ",5
" We had a lot of fun.  Fun food, fun cocktails, good service and unique interior.  We had the pork crackings, deviled eggs and great/great ribs.  some of the best ribs ever. ",4
 Great food! Anna was our server. She was attentive and fun. ,5
" Great as always, food and drinks rock, great service too ",5
" Group of 5, sat on patio.  Everything was great.  Loved the atmosphere.  Food was very tasty.  Pretzels, pirogies, are must haves.  Fried chicken dinner excellent value and taste.  Music was a little loud when we first sat down but was lowered so we could hear each other. ",5
" The atmosphere here is really eclectic and inviting, the decor is mismatched matching and comfortable. The live music (it was a Saturday night) was soothing and fun. We had a kale salad and turkey sandwich and both were delicious. ",5
 Excellent service and wonderful food! A very fun place to spend an hour or the entire evening! ,5
" Third visit to this fun place. It's a great place for trying out a variety of foods. Excellent oysters. The Jules Cabernet Franc rocked. Awesome wine list and great wines by the glass. Service was a little scattered but overall will go back, happily, again. ",4
 I had the lamb sandwich. The lamb tasted as if it was cooked the night before. Did not taste good. ,2
" I have been here twice and both times did not disappoint. The food is a touch on the pricey side for what you get, but then again, you are in Napa so you almost expect a few $$ more than planned. ",4
" This is a good restaurant with great servers. I liked the sandwich I ordered but it was heavy on the cheese. The flavors were not subtle - they hit you on the head. I would say that the creme brulee had a great crust but the custard was a bit tasteless. It is a good restaurant, but I do not think it is great. However, I only went once, and would like to go again and order something different to make sure I am correct. ",3
" We had a lovely time at Angele, the service was stellar. The wine list was good, the food was good. I did wish the food had been a bit more interesting. I felt the selections were somewhat limited. The bread was amazing, and the food was all very good, but I just felt it was not superior. For the prices we paid, I would expect superior. Several of our party had variations on Eggs benedict. No one raved about their meal. I had Steak Frites. The potatoes were not exceptional, and may have been mass produced. The steak was good and the sauce was stellar. ",4
 Food to die for! Service to match! Memorable! ,5
 Went here last Friday based and other reviews I had seen and we were not disappointed. Overall worth every penny as the food and service were fantastic. Would go back any time. ,5
" We dine at Angele about once a month and despite having had fine meals all over Napa, this is still our favorite for the service and innovative cuisine. Staff are approachable and incredibly knowledgeable and our server even remembered what we had at our last visit.  Always a treat to come here! ",5
" The food and service were okay. There are many restaurants to choose from in Napa, however, and this would not be at the top of the list. ",3
 Great food! The desserts will not disappoint. Going for seconds next visit to Napa. ,4
" Even though I gave you high stars so as not to ding your restaurant, I have to say the following... Angele is my favorite, so when i heard they were offering brunch I was really excited to make a reservation. I was SO dissapointed. The ""brunch"" menu was just the regular lunch menu with the addition of a croque monsieur and one duck egg in the hole. Neither sounded good to me. I was expecting them to ELEVATE the traditional brunch dishes, eggs benedict, french toast, etc. Instead I ordered fish and chips. I'm sorry I cant recomend Brunch, but I still am a fan of the restaurant. ",3
 I have been in the Restaurant business for many years. This restaurant is truly a great experience. We loved everything from food to service. Can't wait to come back again. ,5
" After a few missteps, the restaurant has returned to its former glory. Sandwiches, salads and, of course, french onion soup were all in the best French bistro tradition. ",4
" This Restaraunt had good food, good service and good ambiance. However, for the price, my expectation was that service, food and ambiance would be excellent. ",3
" The best restaurant experience I've had..is that too much of an over statement? No. Delicious, well seasoned, thoughtful, creative and just damn delicious food captured this foodies heart. Wonderful, knowledgeable server, efficient and non intrusive are ice, all in a charming french ambience without being overly pretentious or snooty. Loved the coq au vin, the mussels, Brussels sprouts with apples and salted caramel ice cream. A terrific find and our best dining experience in napa by far ",5
 We went here to celebrate our engagment and everyone was so nice!  They gave us free champagne.  The food and service was excellent! ,5
" This is a nice place, very popular with outdoor seating along the river. The food was technically very well prepared but it wasn't as interesting as you would expect from the menu descriptions. The hostess actually scolded us for asking for a different table which put a damper on the whole experience (it was a friend's 70th and I had walked to the restaurant earlier in the day to ask for a nice table -- we ended up in a busy path way next to the bar -- yes, I know everyone wants a nice table and yes I know we got there early, yada yada). Overall, I wouldn't go back, although I understand why locals would like it. ",4
 We are locals who recently moved to Napa. We have been trying many of the restaurants in the area and found Angele to be one of the best. In fact we rated it in our top three in downtown Napa. The service is what made this a memorable night out. The menu had a variety of entrees that we will definitely come back to try. We had the coq au vin and the salmon and they were prepared suberbly. The wines by the glass were top quality and priced well. The Ancien Pinot Noir was well worth the $14 per glass price. We rated this a 10 due to both the quality and service. The servings were a little small but we made up for it by ordering a side of the pommes de frites. which were excellent. We will definitely go back. ,5
" We had an amazing dinner here the other night. For starters,, we had the beet salad, the apple salad and the pate de champagne. All were terrific and displayed so beautifully on the plates. For entrees, we had the scallops, the duck, the quail, and the pork - all of which were outstanding. Our server took great care of us, and he was always available when we needed something. ",4
" terrible, non responsive waiter, - all 4 appetizers were miniscule, and tasteless!! One out of 4 of the meals (SALMON)was good, the other three were just bland . We were so embarrassed for in front of our guests, as earlier in the year we had fabulous meals. The menu has not changed fro the better ",1
 Best Sunday brunch ever! I am returning soon! ,5
" The location, atmosphere, service are excellent. Dress: very casual to very nice. The food is really good. But....it's one of those pretentious French restaurants where the portion is ridiculously small, and they try to be too foody or creative with the dishes. My husband got duck- maybe 1 1/2 ounces of meat with various garnishes- it was very good but very small. I got the pork loin- maybe 2 ounces of meat molded with ground meat, with 1 spoon of some very undercooked lentils with a small slice of gourd--gourd rind, no squash or flesh inside, just gourd. We are not fussy eaters and consider ourselves experienced in different types of cuisine. This was a disappointment for us. The creme brûlée was excellent. ",4
" We hadn't been to Angele since the recent chef change but now we'll be returning more often. The menu is a delight with something for everyone, and the food is prepared and served expertly in a lovely setting overlooking the Napa River. Although many people prefer to eat on the outdoor terrace, I really enjoy the coziness of the French cottage feel indoors. ",4
" We've been averaging a visit to Angele every few weeks, because we just can't get enough of it's fantastic and interesting menu, nor of it's wonderful servers and very approachable sommelier! Noise level is perfect with us having no problem holding a conversation comfortably - not something you find in many restaurants.  We see ourselves going back many times over! ",5
" Some restaurants must do everything their own special way, like this one. Some get it wrong, like this one. I've had a Croque Monsieur in France, and at Bouchon. It's not an open face sandwich on thick crust Italian style bread. But that's how it's served here. It is an abuse to call this Croque Monsieur and it should not be. Maybe you want their Pizzetta instead, but don't expect a tomato sauce. How about their pasta? That doesn't have tomato sauce either, rather both come with squash. Don't like your pasta or pizza with squash? Not in the mood for mussels? Well then, your only choice left is a burger. They can cook it medium rare but that's about the only good thing to say about this place apart from the service. ",2
" Not enough food even for seniors. They give you a big plate of cheese at the end to make up for the food, but none of us (party of 4) like cheese. So for us, it was a disappointed $80 meal. ",2
 Enjoyed our meal immensely. Waiter was very patient as it took us a very long time before we ordered. Food was excellent! ,5
" A cornerstone of fine dining in Napa, Angele continues to set the bar for a great restaurant community. ",4
" Dined there on 10/30/2013 and had lovely service, cocktails, oysters, dinner (salmon for him and duck for me) and dessert. The duck was truly inspired, pairing it with persimmon, as was the butterscotch pot de creme with cardamon cream. ",5
" Great service, food &amp; ambiance! ",5
" Wait staff was un reachable. Wine guy was pushing the expensive wines, the food was good but very French portions so beware. Rib eye is not what you think. No bone in style ribeye cut, very fancy round ""patty"" style (delicious but not worth the price tag). Highlight was the butterscotch pudding and coffee. Too bad we had to wait until the end. Would I try again? Too many other restaurants to explore. ",3
" The steak tartar contained too much mustard. I could not Eat it. The ribeye steak consisted of 2 small pieces of meat Which I doubt was actually ribeye. It was about 6 oz Total, accompanied by few potatoes. The Meat was over Cooked. For $36 this dish is excessively priced. Excellent service though. Overall very dissapointing experience. ",2
" This restaurant was recommended to us by a local person. Very cool outside seating, busy bar for a Tuesday night. The food was wonderful, and the service was even better. Great attention to detail, very friendly but not overbearing. We did eat inside even though they have heaters for the outside seating. It was busy, but the noise level was not too loud. If you are in downtown Napa, I highly recommend this restaurant. ",5
" the ambience &amp; food were very good and the server was attentive, but somewhere along the way our food ticket was lost. we waited more than an hour between the appetizer and main entree. both the manager &amp; server came to apologize for the delay. the server also took off some items from our bill. the restaurant handled the situation well, but there is nothing worse than a long delay between appetizer &amp; main entree. that being said, we would return to the restaurant because of the way the situation was handled. ",4
" We haven't been able to stay away! Our second time in several weeks, there were some incredible, creative menu additions that we were talking about the next day. The squash pasta (that's pasta MADE from winter squash) with egg on top was just as amazing as getting a full body massage - it was complete food therapy!  Entrees were delicate with plenty of nuance and HEARTINESS. We hate to leave hungry, and that will never happen at Angele. Just a pleasure all around.  Service was top notch with even the chance to get to know our server a little, which we always enjoy.  Side note: GREAT decaf. I had it with dessert and I don't know what they are brewing, but it was great. ",5
" Charming, very casual restaurant on the river front in Napa. We sat outside and it was surprisingly quiet although it was an early dinner reservation 6 pm. They brought out nice warm, crunchy French bread. We brought our own bottle of Chardonnay, which I would not do again as the corkage fee was $25 AND they sell their bottles at Retail prices with little or no mark up. We split a a salad of beets and burata which was very good. I had the scallops which were cooked to perfection, just the right portion and severed over pureed and diced celery root. Delicious! My husband had the pork tenderloin also cooked to perfection. ",4
 In the evening we love the zinc bar and romantic couples atmosphere inside. This was my first time visiting for lunch. The outdoor seating is lovely and all my favorite French lunch options were offered. ,4
 Angele always comes through...a fine restaurant with helpful staff. ,5
" Wow!!! Better if possible!!! Fresh, interesting, colorful And talented ",5
 I love their relaxed yet elegant feel of the outdoor dining option. With the overhead heaters even a brisk evening with a light wind is nice on the patio. The service staff are knowledgeable and pleasant and always have good recommendations. Of course my favorite is the French onion soup; hot flavorful and cheesy. Our little gem salads were crisp and fresh with just the right amount of dressing to flavor and not drown. Then there are the pomme frites; super! When at a French restaurant eat French!  This is one of our go to destinations when in Napa. ,5
" We dined here for the first time during AZ Restaurant Week.  Fabulous ""restaurant week"" menu with their top options available ... a great value!  Will definitely return again.  Don't miss their pretzels with cheese fondue ... a meal in itself!  Ribs are outstanding as well.  Only issue was the noise level indoors ... very loud.  The patio was perfect! ",4
" Service was excellent. In fact, the best I've experienced in quite some time. Table was ready on time, wait staff was friendly and helpful, and food was delivered extremely quickly (almost too quick). I loved the oversize chairs and atmosphere. Only critique would be the live music was difficult to talk over. The ribs ordered were tasty, though overpriced. The pretzel bread with fondue cheese was great appetizer, though half orders should be available for parties of 2. Overall, a great Scottsdale eatery and it made my list to revisit. ",5
 The restaurant was packed on saturday night and our hostess was fast and cheerful. The drink was good but the food is average at best. We had the chicken salad for appetizer and it was ok. My 36hour pork rib was supposed to be tender and tasty but its little meat was just bland and tough. The salmon tastes fishy and the chicken is average. We didn't want to try the dessert... ,2
 Restaurant is near the Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall and other restaurants. Parking is convenient and free at the mall parking high rise. Restaurant has new urban casual feel and is a very relaxed atmosphere. Menu is diverse and appealing. French dip sandwich is delicious. Staff is friendly and efficient. Had a enjoyable dinner. ,4
 You would think a hot spot like this place would have a much better wine selection. I was very dissappointed. They have excellent cheeses and meats from all over the world and only 2 choices of chardonnay by the bottle and not even popular ones. I think they need to focus on what kind of resturant they want. The menu was all over the board. They had a few great items but not sure about the other items. The steak was cook perfectly but one of my other guests ordered a salad and it was swimming in dressing. ,4
" Amazing food, amazing atmosphere and staff!  Every time we are in Arizona we make reservations here! ",5
 It was recommended for the pretzel and cheese dip.  The pretzel was exceptional but the rest of the food was ordinary and follows the name.  Located near the very busy and hip Fashion Square area.  Fine if you are in the area shopping but not a destination. ,2
 We arrived for our reservations about 15 minutes early so we decided to grab drinks at the bar. The bartender was pretty rude and made an unnecessary comment to one guest in our party. Although we had reservations for inside it was taking awhile so we opted to sit outside. This was a slight mistake on our behalf because it was still way too warm outside. Our server was excellent but I can't bring myself to give 5 stars due to the service from the bartender. The food was good but not over the top. ,4
" This place is for teens not for adults. Prices are too expensive for what everything is worth it here.  Food and drinks are very limited that you pretty much end up eaten a hamburger with French fries for $20 dollars plus the expensive limited beverages. Waitress are ridiculously pretentious &amp; snobby ...anyway..everything us too pretentious, too expensive, too noisy and very limited. Oh they advertise as a waterfront restaurant that's why we chose this place among others; but when we asked to be seated by the water the obnoxious waitress told us that there was no water ""it was only for marketing purposes"" so, no water, no good food, no nothing they presume in the website"" ",3
" This was one of the best restaurants Ive eaten at in a long time!  Excellent food, fabulous service, beautiful environment.  Mr Fox if you read this, please expand to Chicago! ",5
" Very creative menu, glad we went.  Was loud just from people talking but at 7:30 the live music started.  We left as soon as dinner was done as unable to talk anymore ",4
 Great food and a great night with friends. We had the soft pretzel appy which was amazing and the house made potato chips- delish! So full that we ended up with salads that were delightful. Deocr was very cool and very hip. Live band. ,4
" First time at this Fox restaurant.  Prompt seating, live music but incredibly noisy. The place was crowded we were seated right in front of the kitchen, kind of bar area for an 8:15p reservation.   Service started out good, but then got spotty.  Our appetizer appeared quickly but after our dinner was served attention waned, when my husband got up to go to the restroom he had to ask our server to come and get our dessert order. Overall the food was delicious, I classify this as more of an appetizer &amp; dessert, drink place with a great assortment especially the pretzels and cheese fondue and salted caramel custard! ",4
 Love celebrating special occasions at C D.  We had a blast‼️‼️ ,5
" I have heard numerous people rave about this place and so I was nervous that it would not meet my expectations. I brought a group of my girlfriends to kick off our getaway and I have to say I was NOT disappointed. Of course we got the pretzel rolls, delicious! We all tried something different and left feeling very full and satisfied. Our waiter was very attentive our food came out quickly but tasted freshly made. Thanks for a great night! ",5
" was looking thru Scottsdale restaurants to try with another couple and the reviews were really good, so thought we'd give it a chance.  we really had a great time.  the band was excellent and we would come just for the band.  everyone enjoyed their food and the place was just fun! ",5
" Food was mediocre at best, enviroment was great, drinks ok as well...disappointed for what I expected ",2
" My girlfriend and I made reservations for 7 pm, and showed up a little early. We were told it would be take a few minutes for a table to be ready, which we didn't mind for it was a Saturday night and the place was very busy. The two hostesses were very friendly and got us the next table available after other guests had come in. Being just the two of us, we were patient for it was very busy. Our waitress was very nice and the food was amazing! Especially a pretzels! Overall a great experience, and great service.   **Note - It's funny when people try to walking in to get a table right away on the weekends, it's the WEEKEND, they're gonna be busy.........just like the hostess said--next time, make a reservation lol.... ",5
 Great place to meet friends or family and have some good food.  I was very impressed!! ,4
" Appetizers were better than the entrees, so get three of those to share! And get some Carmel popcorn to go! Desserts were yummy too. Great trendy place! Love the chairs and chandeliers ",4
" Culinary Dropout is a great alternative place to meet friends. The menu is simple and based on good local ingredients, the anti-pasti is a fun way to start a meal.  They do a couple of signature dishes which are worth trying. Not badly priced for what you get. ",4
" Food and service were excellent. We were with friends we had not seen in a few months, so we had a lot of catching up. Waitress understood and let us sit and talk - not rushing us was appreciated. We sat outside as the inside was noisy - good choice. Parking was easy and watching the people walk by on the sidewalk reminded me of eating in a French cafe.  ",5
 This was our first visit to Culinary Dropout and we were quite pleased with the outdoor dining experience.  The inside seemed a little dark.  Our server was very attentive and the food was good. ,5
" They have these butternut squash ravioli that are in a brown butter sauce which are the reason I go. The service there has never been exceptional. The servers and bartenders usually give out the entitled server vibe, like they're doing me a favor. I eat out 10 times a week and I waited tables for 13 years. So I know kindness when I see it and usually not there. Butternut Squash Ravioli brings me back. ",3
" Culinary Dropout is a cool place.  Good food, brews on tap, and really trendy setting.  Close to walking distance to many other bars, restaurants, and high end shopping.  Great service and not rushed.  We made reservations so got a good table. Many folks without will be likely set at the community table section.  So make reservations if that's not your thing.  Wife had buttermilk fried chicken which was good and I had jalapeño ribs which were also very good.  Got bread, sopressata, and really good white cheddar.  San tan hop shock is good beer.    ",4
" My family- wife, In-laws and my two girls (5 and 8) went on Easter at 2pm. Our first time here and I was very impressed with the easy location, easy parking access, the ambiance of the place was amazing. Decor was top notch and I loved the inside/outside design of the restaurant. Service was excellent, table was awesome and super comfortable (we had a round table with bigger, very comfy chairs). The ordering experience and the wait staff were fabulous. Menu choices were super. The only thing slightly disappointing were the portion sizes. Rib eye streak came pre-sliced, my ribs were good, my mom in law said she has has better fish and chips. My girls really loved the turkey pastrami sandwich on the pretzel bread bun- so that was a home run.  ",4
 Took my wife there Friday night. The place was packed Fortunately we had a reservation. They have a nice selection of beers on tap. The bartenders make all kinds if drinks too and lots if them. Started with the antipasto section of the food. Everything was yummy. They make this balsamic reduction in asparagus that is quite yummy. They also out the reduction in olive oil and serve it with a great fresh bread. Many cheese and meat selections too. We could have just gone for that and been happy. I had the fried chicken. The chicken was better than average but I have had better. The sides that came with it were not so good. Overall it's an place to be seen more so than eat. ,4
 I can't stop thinking about the pretzel fondue. Not to be missed. ,5
" I have a hard time hearing people at my table in restaurants. That was not a problem here.  Food was good, server was awesome, and we did not feel rushed to leave.  They didn't mind us visiting for a while after our meal. ",5
" We were amazed that it cost $100 for 4 people to have a chicken breast, a tablespoon of garlic mashed potatoes each, Caesar salad with hardly any dressing, and a Tiramisu to share.  We were celebrating 2 birthdays and usually (at most restaurants we frequent) are given a dessert for the occasion.  We were shocked and disappointed that they only sang to the 2 birthdays because we ordered and paid for the Tiramisu. ",4
" Really good  Wait time sucked even though I had a reservation  But overall service, ambiance and food was great  Nikki (was really good ) was on top of everything ",4
 The food is horrible able and everything's extremely overpriced  for the lack of quality.  They try to make up for it with large portions but who wants a lot of a bad thing.  The service was excellent I just wish the food wasn't so bad. Do yourself a favor and just go somewhere else ,3
" Spaghetti extremely dry, very little sauce, not very tasty, not many spices, food cost too high for value, waitress seem irritated, not recommend ",3
" Given the fact that many restaurants are closed Christmas Eve, thankfully Buca in Chandler was open. The restaurant was busy. The staff were running around like crazy with an awesome attitude! The food came out hot and was delicious! We were fortunate to enjoy a great bottle of wine from their ""discontinued"" list. ",5
" Due to the fact it was Christmas Eve, and we were looking for time to enjoy family we felt very rushed. Server was too focused on getting in as many people and tips as possible.  The server was somewhat friendly but seemed to forget the fact it was family time for us and for the price of dinner we didn't need to be rushed.   We've eaten here many times before and it is a great group place.  Family style sizes however we felt the food this evening was too mass produced.  Missing a bit of that yummy flavor we are used to. ",3
 Great food and lots of it! ,5
 Dinner with my new in-laws. Service was good. Food was ok. ,4
" I booked a birthday dinner, and was never told they charge a cake 'holding fee' of $15! They told me this when I checked in, and when I said I had no idea about that, was told 'oh, they should have said something when you booked your reservation..it's a new charge'. At that point I was stuck and had no option but to pay. Poor service throughout the night, inattentive waiter, and a ridiculous cake fee. The food is always consistent, so I can't complain about the quality, but will not be returning due to the service. ",2
 Good food and nice portion sizes. This place is great for groups or family meals. This location is among the best Buca's I have dined. ,4
 Aside from the great tasting food was the service provided by Kyle. He did an excellent job with our party of 10. ,5
 The Waitstaff Was Amazing! They accommodated all of our late RSVPs... They are really amazing!!! ,5
 It's buca de beppo. Mheh. ,3
" Other than the noise level, this was a great visit! ",5
 This a great noisy family style place to dine.  We had 12 at the table and only one problem - the  veal saltimbocca was tasty but tough.  The lasagne and the prosciutto chicken dishes are fantastic.  We also shared a giant tiramusu (yum) and colossal brownie sundae. ,4
" Went to Buca di Beppo for a graduation celebration on a Friday night. There were 10 people in our party and were seated right away. We were not in a big hurry as we were catching up with family, but service was slow. I recognize it was a Friday and there were other people there for graduation celebrations. With that said, if you have a large group and are not in a hurry, this is a good place to go. ",3
" Food came out cold, had to be re-cooked. Calamari was awful-- restaurant removed the dish from our bill ",2
 Excellent pasta and birthday cake!  Adam was a good waiter! ,5
 Always love it there ,5
 Good food. Good place for dinner. ,4
" We anticipated New Years eve to be busy at the restaurant but didn't expect as poor a service that most of the items on our order had something off with them.  Overall, average Italian food, good value for family though. ",3
" Callen was great and very attentive. food was good, service was outstanding. ",5
" Service  was average at best, no management around. Lots of food, pretty good too ",3
" I keep going back because I like the lemon chicken. I was disappointed to see the caprese salad no longer has roasted red peppers. And the tomatoes were hard.  We had a $15 coupon for Black Friday and decided to go.  The service was so slow. We waited forever for our drinks.  Then again to place our order. The food came quick but then we waited with empty dirty dishes for ages. Nice girl just not good server.  We had three pieces of chicken, pasta with sauce, caprese, a house wine  and beer.  The bill for two with tip was $98 after we used our coupon. OUCH. To much for that type of place. ",4
" Excellent waiter,  good food for family style dining. ",4
" We stopped here for an afternoon lunch. There were not many people there that day and we were seated right away. We ordered the shells and the manicotti which were both good. The shells are my favorite. We did get dessert that day which we normally don't do. I cant remember what exactly it was called but it was the cake. I had my doubts about it because it said it had lemon flavoring in it but the waitress said you cannot taste the lemon. The cake was ok and I could taste the lemon, I think I would of preferred the ice cream like I was going to get. It seemed after we got our food though the waitress kind of just disappeared and we had to scope the place out to find her for things we needed. ",5
 Food above average. Service not so good. Waited a long time with 4 children for a reserved table.  Server seemed rushed and kept telling us how busy it was. ,3
" Extremely Disappointing.  We were looking for a fun and causal place to celebrate a birthday. We made a reservation but it was unnecessary the restaurant was nearly empty. We were seated right away, and ordered shortly there after.  The waiter came to the table a few times to refill water  and soft drinks. After 30 minutes he told us that our order was coming up any minute; then he seem to vanish. after another 20 minutes I got up to look for him and saw him sitting in the kitchen.  The manager then came over to the table and informed us that our ticket had some how been lost and that were going to start making our food right away.  She also stated tat she would be adjusting our check to ""accommodate"" us for the delay. 15 minutes later the food arrived,  over all the food was rather bland.  The waiter than handed me the bill, the accommodating adjustment - $10. That's right less than the amount of a free soft drink for the four of us.   Then both the manager and waiter said to us.  We hope you had a good time.  Needless to say No we did not. Bye bye Buca ",1
" Most entries come in two sizes:  1)small, which will be well enough for two, maybe three, 2) large, which will be enough for  four, maybe even six.    A very nice selection of Italian dishes and salads that are delicious.  Will go again. ",4
 Our server was very  knowledgable-we loved that! Our  appetizers Thru desserts were very good! We will definely be back! ,5
 LOVE BUCA I HAD WEDDING  SHOWER  BIRTHDAY  AND BABY SHOWER THERE ,5
" The server was amazing, the food was good, took a long time to get and was warm not hot, which was strange. However the restaurant was freezing cold so maybe that was it. ",4
 Fair to poor.. ,2
" A bit too warm!  Outside temp in Chandler was about 118 degrees, inside restaurant was struggling to keep the room cool.   Our server was great and did what she could to make our experience a good one! ",3
" Excellent food, outstanding service and was very nice for our group, including 2 three month old babies.  We were seated in the back of a room, with a long bench to set baby carriers and stuff and we had room to walk babies as needed.  My daughter was able to nurse completely discreetly, and there  was the chatter of many other small children in the area, so we did not ever stand out.  We will be back again with our grand babies, even more that we came before them.  But turn up the old music, like Dean Martin.  We can't even hear it anymore.   Once again:  the service was amazing. ",5
" This was not our first visit to Buca.  We love that they serve their entrees family style.  This was the first time we tried the chicken cannelloni - oh my how delicious.  Not just a little chicken, but oodles with the wonderfully flavorful ricotta and mozzarella.  Their chicken parmigiana is also the best.  Over the years we have never been disappointed with the quality of their food. ",5
 We got seated the minute we walked in ,5
 Staff was great. Food was family style and was perfectly fine. For a chain you could do a lot worse. Had 8 people in the party and nobody left hungry that is for sure. A little pricey though for what you get. Leftovers for days though. ,3
 Great food and great atmosphere! ,5
" Great food, great service, water and tea always full and then they let us talk without trying to move us out.  A lovely evening. ",5
" Everything was outstanding, from the cocktails and appetizers, to the main dish and dessert. ",5
" The food and services are always outstanding. The presentation is superb. The restaurant employees, front office, servers and bus people are well trained, knowledgeable about the food preparation and very helpful. Prices are a little high for our senior budget, but we love coming to Roy's for most special occasions. ",5
 Birthday - great food- too expensive ,5
" Roy's was your Celebrating  Special place.  Always had good food with wonderful flavor.   Since it has been sold the food quality has disappeared - the food was poor quality and not cooked correctly.  I had a Lobster tail - it was mushy and no flavor at all.  The Prawns from last year were gorgeous these were small shrimp, the Scallop last year was perfect - this year tiny and no flavor.  Hubby got the chicken and it was dried out.  Time to find a new Special Occasion place because it was not Roy's Hawaiian Fusion.  Wait staff was great but surprised they served this food.  I saw a couple we know and asked about the Lobster.  She felt it had no flavor and was mushy also.   Very disappointed! ",2
 Anthony was our waiter and he offered excellent customer service.  All our entrees were superb.  Loved the Cesar salad and enjoyed three desserts.  Will return soon! ,5
" It was good, not great. Service was very good, very attentive. Desserts were amazing. ",4
" Excellent in all respects, including presentation and unique cocktail offerings. We had the Classic Four entree--highly recommended.  Our friends (and local hosts) characterized this restaurant as ""for adults,"" meaning not to expect screaming kids. Acoustics seemed much better than average: we could easily hear each other; no need to yell!  Classy. ",5
 Great as always! ,5
 As usual we had an outstanding experience dining at Roy's. ,5
" Food was okay but not as good as I remember. Drinks were good but for the price, the food should be exceptional.  The Roy's in Waikiki set's the bar high and the fish we had was exceptional . The food at your Chandler location fell short of my expectations unfortunately. Getting harder to find good seafood in the Valley:( ",3
 Roy's is one of our favorite resturants. Always consistently great food and service. The butter fish is yum! ,5
 Wonderful sushi selection !  Fresh and flavorful . The waiter was able help us with our selections . We have to come back for the soufflé . ,5
 Always great five star ,5
 Excellent as always. The food was great and our server was excellent. Always a great time at Roy’s ,5
" We had a very nice dinner at Roy’s.  The restaurant was full and we had excellent service.  All our food was very good and, of course, the chocolate soufflé was fantastic! ",4
" Roys, which was a long time favorite, is off my list.  The service was poor and our server seemed lost. We waited forever to be greeted by him and then felt rushed by his approach, we had to ask about specials which he knew little about.  Once we started the appetizer was slow top come out and was just so-so. I realized our server was better suited for a job at Applebees when he brought the bottle of Merlot out and started to decant it, without asking and before we tasted it; who decants Merlot anyway? The main coarse was very slow coming out but was hot and pretty good once it got there. We did have desert but they seemed much smaller than I remember.  In the end our server didn’t disappoint, he just walked up and put the check on the table saying he would take it when we were ready. He did return a couple minutes later with a piece of cheesecake and a candle.  It seems he looked at the computer and realized we were there for a birthday celebration, so we got to eat some cake as we were getting ready to leave.  At this point we found the whole experience kind of funny but sad. Just another chain restaurant off our list. ",3
 Somewhat dissapointing. Service was very poor. Took about 15 minutes to get just water. The waiters were unconnected and didn't appear to know what they were doing. It took much longer than expected to get the entree that we decided to skip dessert. The food and ambiance were good. ,2
" Wonderful meal, drinks and atmosphere.  Our server was on top of things.  We could not have asked for a better evening. ",5
 Roy’s is consistently good and offer a nice venue for business meals. ,5
 I love everything about Roy's. I love how they even take a photo for you on a special occasion. ,5
" Reliable food (although shrimp was overcooked), but server was a bit too hit or miss on his presence: pushy on filling wine glasses, didn't check in if we wanted dessert for  nearly 10 minutes after our plates were cleared. ",3
" Roy's is a very nice place for a special occasion. Our meal was good, although a bit pricey for what we got. The atmosphere was very nice though, and the service was excellent. ",4
" Normally have good service at this location. This evening was different.  We weren’t informed of the specials but asked and decided on the Tomahawk ribeye special. Told server we’d have wine with dinner (even specified the Malbec we wanted) and ordered cocktails. Didn’t see our server again until we had finished our meal. No stop for more cocktails, no stop to confirm/bring the wine (we drank water with our meal).  Our salads, steak, and sides were excellent (steak was prepared perfectly) but our experience would have been better with proper service (and wine!). Restaurant missed out on at least $50 additional drink orders.  Our reservation was a Saturday at 6:00....the restaurant was not super busy. ",3
" As always, we had great service and the food is to die for. We love the menu and visit Roy's on a regular bases. We also try to attend all the wine tasting events there which are always super good. ",5
" The quality and creativity of the food was extraordinary!  We went to celebrate my wife’s birthday and we were greeted by the host and taken to our table which was decorated with flower petals and a nice birthday card.  Our server was equally attentive and made a concerted effort to make our visit a memorable one.  As a result, we thoroughly enjoyed our experience and will come back again. ",5
" Rushed and unknowledgable weight staff.  Food ok, but expected more of the typical Hawaii Roys flair. ",3
" We always dine at Roy's when in the area, and they have never disappointed.  Any issue with food is dealt with promptly and to our full satisfaction (not that there have been many).  Our favorite waiter is Bruce, who is fun as well as efficient.   The misoyaki butterfish is the best I have ever enjoyed (although the forbidden rice served with it is often too heavy; ask for plain white rice and they will accommodate).  The desserts are amazing, although we are often too full to enjoy one.  The lobster bisque is also a favorite.   They also handled my parents' 60th anniversary party very well. Food and service were both top notch. ",5
 Anniversary with my girlfriend. We were treated spectacularly. ,5
" Food was excellent, along with the wine selection. Waitstaff was attentive and courteous, a great experience overall ",4
" Went for their Christmas prixe fixe menu.  While service was just a tad slow (expected at 7:00pm on Christmas night), the food was excellent.  As always.  Great seafood, great cocktails, and a warm ambiance. ",5
" I've been to Roy's a number of times and have always had a great experience. I took my parents there for our Christmas Eve dinner and both the food and the service (thanks, Eric!) was great.  Definitely a classy place that you must check out. ",5
" We were pleasantly surprised to find the Chefs Tasting Menu as well as their 3 course offering, what a delicious value!! We always have and will continue to always celebrate birthdays and special occasions with Roy’s!! ",5
" We have been dinign at Roy's for 7 years. There seems to have been a large change of staff from greeters to wait staff. Our 2 concerns: Reserved dining for birthday surprise. When we arrived, no recognition of special event. Had to ask if they were aware.  Waiter needs more training. He brought the bill as he brought dessert. ",4
 Excellent celebration of graduation from ASU for our son in law. ,4
" Awesome dinner. Had the special which was beef short ribs and misoyaki butterfish. Both were fork tender, moist and great flavors. We split a wedge salad, which was more than enough for both of us. We ordered the Pineapple Upside down cake, which is always a favorite. But, this time is was burnt around the edges. We should of brought it to our servers attention. But, it takes at least 20 minutes for one to be baked and we really were full from dinner. Not usual for our favorite place. We’ll be back! ",5
 We came for fish and we got what we came for. The mixed plate of 3 fishes was a perfect mix. Started with a canoe for two appetizer that was more than enough food. ,5
" Our trip to Roy's was due to a groupon prix fre  meal.  We were promptly seated in a requested booth.  The service was impeccable. Our waiter was Chase.  He was very attentive without being pushy or rushing us.  There were multiple wait staff with assigned duties that they all carried out perfectly.   The appetizer spring rolls were very good. For the main entree we both had the macadamia nut crusted fish in lobster sauce. It was delightful.   We finished with the chocolate tort! Oh, don't hesitate to order this if you have a sweet tooth! Because of our ""clean"" eating habits we generally don't eat out often. Roy's was a nice treat.  I would recommend this for a special occasion or if you are used to eating rich, buttery food, anytime! ",4
" The food was good. We had a sushi appetizer, my fiancé ordered the filet and shrimp, and I had the macadamia crusted mahi mahi. The service was a little slow to place an order and get drink, but the food came out timely. ",3
" We bought a Groupon for fixed price 3 course meal. We were familiar with their fixed menu offering, but surprised that the Groupon was different than their standard menu albeit ""VIP"". Ha! We had i think 4 choices of entree + extra $ for other offerings. One of us chose one of the upgrades which was a delicious 3 fish sampler. The other the macadamia nut crusted fish, also very good. Service was spotty as the server had his favorite table he hovered. We chose a lemon tart dessert which was just ok, should have chosen the chocolate. ",4
" Service was outstanding and the food was quite good as well. Although, the filet that was ordered was medium well rather than the medium that was ordered. ",5
 Great food &amp; great waiter! ,5
" Steaks were truly amazing.  Loved the maple bacon appetizer and the French onion soup.  Classic steakhouse, well executed. ",5
" My husband and I consider Fleming's one of the best steakhouses we've been to! We always have an amazing meal, whether it's steak or any of their other offerings. Service is awesome and we would recommend it highly. Can't wait to return! ",5
" The food was incredible: the filet was the most tender I have ever eaten. The service was excellent: the advice was spot on; the waiter was attentive, but didn't hover. ",5
" As always, great food. ",5
" We eat at various Flemingse.  We were seated in the back room.  While it was less noisy than the main room, the air conditioning was very uncomfortable.  It was apparent that since the a/c vents were partially covered, management was well aware of this issue.  Someone from management should test this out.  This should not meet the standards of Flemings.  Cudos for outstanding service. ",3
" All 4 of us greatly enjoyed our dinners. My 6 oz Filet was on special with 2 shrimp. It was very good but a bit overcooked from the Rare that I had ordered. Perhaps because of the smaller size or being a bit of a thinner end piece? We will return again!  I was not going to send my Filet back while the other three were eating their 12 ounce Filets and meals.  I did send the accompanying French Fries that I ordered as a side dish back because they were not hot. The replacement fries were fantastic, and very hot! ",5
" It was great, but it is loud. Won’t stop us from going back though. ",5
" Fleming's has been one of my favorite places.  I always say -- very pricey AND well worth it. For whatever reason, this was not a positive experience.  Because of the good history, of course I will return and give it another try.  Yet I have to express this -- had this been my first time, I would probably never return, as there are many other options to spend over $100 pp for dinner. ",2
" Kerry the server was amazing. The drinks were right on point. The fresh bread and cheese were delicious.  The the French onion soup was over the top delicious.  The wedge salad was fresh.  The dry rub ribeye with sauce was the best my husband has had in years.  The flemings potatoes, Brussels sprouts and Mac and cheese were delicious!!!!  👍👍👍👍👍 ",5
 Room was too cold! ,5
" Excelent in all aspects, enjoyd the dinner.  Only downside was excessive ambient noise, which made conversation difficult. ",4
 The food and service is always good but the open design of the eating space makes it very noisy and hard to carry on a conversation. ,4
" Prices are exorbitant. Shoestring fries were over cooked, cold and chewy. Steaks were good. ",4
" We love Flemings and this latest visit did not disappoint. Mt steak was perfectly charred on the outside, med rare on the in side and superb taste. ",5
 We had a very enjoyable evening. Jason our server was excellent. ,5
" Bone in filet was not tender, it was ordered rare and should be the most tender. I felt like a K9 tearing apart a skirt steak. Great waiter, beautiful ambiance, just not the best value for the kind of meat offered that evening. Fast service, accurately mixed drinks, nice establishment. Leery of going back as $400 bill got me a poor example of a filet, I'm not concerned about cost, but value yes. ",2
" Mark, our server, was fantastic. We were sat in a nice, large booth and had a fantastic meal! A great way to spend New Year's Eve! I'm still floored at how many people wear PJ's and jeans to a nice restaurant!?! ",5
 It was very nice and met our expectation in terms of quality of steak. But it was slightly noisier that expected because of crowds of this restaurant. Service was excellent. ,5
" I was pleasantly surprised with Fleming’s. I had heard that they had good steaks, but there is another steakhouse I go to that trumps all of them. Fleming’s  could give my other favorite a run for their money! The  12oz Filet mignon was great! I will definitely be returning to Fleming’s! And the service was great! The wait staff was very on top of things and we never waited for drink refills. Love that!! ",5
 Good food we'll prepared and great service make this a go to for a good meal ,5
" My wife and I totally enjoyed our date night with wine, great food, and excellent service. My wife ordered a Caesar salad and a small plate of Filet Mignon. I ordered their Fleming Salad and small plate New Zealand lamb chops. Both meat orders were cooked to our requests. The salads were good and our Small Plate orders were delicious. It was a delightful time together surrounded by good food and conversation. Fleming’s was an excellent choice that we would do again. ",5
" Celebrating the engagement of our son and daughter to be! Our waiter, Byron, was excellent as were all staff members. Great evening! ",4
 Our meal was perfect!  The lobster was succulent and sweet and our steak was pure perfection.  Service was outstanding.  Couldn't ask for a more fabulous evening. ,5
 Great food however they ran out of shrimp for the mixed grill ugh. ,5
 Early Christmas Dinner with family from out of town.. ,5
" The food was excellent!  Our servers were great and very attentive.  Overall staff was excellent.  But excellence comes at a price and Flemings is not cheap.  However, it was worth it if you want to splurge on a great meal for a special occasion. ",5
" Overall great as always. However, I do not recommend getting any seafood. Scallops were gritty and lobster was tough. I know it is a steak house but if you cannot get it right I say leave it alone. ",5
" Friendly staff, excellent service and delicious food. ",5
" My wife's filet was delivered COLD and way undercooked. I ordered a strip and was presented with a rib eye, fatty at that. Noise level was the highest I ever experienced in a ""better"" restaurant. Uncomfortable when you can't hear the person across the table. The wait staff were either running or walking swiftly creating a distraction, like the place is on fire or hurry up and get out of here.  The ""Manager"" had the filet removed from the bill which was the thing to do. I didn't get into I ordered a strip and got a rib eye, I wanted to get out of the place at that point. The whole experience was a disappointment.  In closing, an individual from Flemings called me the day after my miserable experience since I had responded to their solicitation to complete a survey. Of course he was apologetic and hopefully embarrassed by listening to what he probably already knows goes on in that place. He wantonly invited me back ""to make good"" assuring me the finest in service and food product. I'll have to think about it. ",1
 Lovely experience. ,4
" We had a wonderful time celebrating my wife's birthday as we were seated promptly even though we were early. Our server, Jason W., was wonderful as he was attentive throughout the evening. We even had a chance to speak to the manager about different cuts of steak and he gave us some great information that we will remember for the next time we come. Having the complementary gifts (chocolate and a coupon for next time) was a nice touch to end the evening.  We can't wait to come back!!! ",5
" Thanksgiving dinner with my family, didn't get seated until 7:40 for a 7:15 reservation. No apology and the waiter quickly told us they were out of green beans. This was a standard side for Thanksgiving dinner.  The service was good but the time between courses was long, and after we placed our order the waiter returned to tell us that they were out of mashed potatoes and they would need to make more to accommodate us.  All the rest of the food came about 30  minutes later sans potatoes and they arrived 10 minutes after that. Dinner was good, I had the tenderloin and the other 5 had traditional turkey and stuffing etc.  Upon ordering dessert, we were again told they were out of something else on the standard holiday menu, pumpkin cheesecake and they would have to substitute something else. Overall  the experience was poor and I was very disappointed in the way the meal was handled. This was a trial for our family as we normally stay home and cook ourselves. But, I suggested we try something new since our group was small this year. I can say nobody had a good feeling about the way things went and it has really soured us on going out for Thanksgiving ever again. You dropped the ball Fleming's. We would have most likely made this place our new traditional Thanksgiving spot. ",2
 Steakhouse that screws up a steak! Not going back. ,3
 Great service and great steaks. Good caesar salad also ,4
" Four of us had a wonderful Prime Rib dinner...the Sunday Special.  It was excellent as was the service.  Great Value!  Special included any salad, any side and desert for $43.00.  Can't be beat. ",5
 Staff was very professional. Met our needs way and beyond. God was cooked beautifully ,2
" Excellent spot for a milestone birthday or other special occasion. Super service, Fantastic Food, all around great time. Kennedy was our server and she was top shelf like everything else there. Busy night but you wouldn't have known that. Special surprise for the birthday girl at the end of the night. Super place for that ""certain""  night. Classic and Classy ",5
 The restaurant was very noisy so we requested to be seated in the patio area which was great!  Enjoyed our meal and the tranquility of the patio dining area. ,5
" Great ambiance, chill place to go to enjoy a great meal, loved the signature drinks, very friendly staff. ",4
" Good food as in all Fox restaurants but portions were really small for the money. My ""cheap salad"" as it is named was $5 and was about 1.5 cups of lettuce with a dusting of blue cheese dressing. I guess I won't be going cheap any more:) the butternut squash canneloni were wonderful and the place quaint so we may go back. ",3
" As a group of mostly 60ish, we descended upon Culinary Drop Out at the suggestion of one of our members, who said there were many food choices and a good range of prices.  Another of our friends came with specific suggestions from her daughter (fried chicken - delicious, caramel corn - a treat).  We had a reservation, were seated promptly enough, the ladies who assisted were wonderful, the food was really delicious except for the ahi on the salad, which was too fishy-tasting to eat, was returned to the kitchen, and replaced with a kale salad with grilled salmon.  Oh, and the live music was great.  We enjoyed ourselves immensely, even though the crowd averaged 20 years our junior, and the ambiance was noisy.  A little energy and some delicious food were good for our old souls.  Thank you!  We'll come back. ",4
 I had a nice vibe from this place. The waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and supper friendly. We sat outside and it was really nice. The food was a little heavy for my taste and diet. Not enough choices for dieters. ,3
" Culinary Dropout confirmed our reservation and let us know ahead of time we would be outside in the patio. Our group of nine was promptly seated upon arriving and had a great experience. Our waitress was helpful and attentive, and we all enjoyed our food and drinks. Would definitely come back here. Plus, parking is so easy compared with the Phoenix location. ",5
 My wife and I were given a gift card for our twentieth anniversary. We chose the Culinary Dropouts because it had the most diverse menu. We were greeted at the door with smiles and shown promptly to our seats (we made a reservation before going). The food was delicious and the atmosphere was relaxed. Thank you for a wonderful evening. ,4
" We visited Scottsdale for the first time recently and this restaurant was recommended by a local friend. It has a hip,  fun vibe, but more bar foodish then I was expecting.  My friend got a kale/corn salad that he always gets and loves. I got 36hr ribs, which were alright. My husband got a steak, that came out sliced under a salad (kind of odd). The vibe was really fun though,  and the drinks and people watching were worth it for sure. ",4
" Love this spot. Very consistent. Good food, good service. Interesting assortment of drinks. ",5
" I wish I could remember our server's name. Male, 20's, glasses, on the patio.  Very helpful in every way, especially in reviewing menue options. My water glass remained empty most of the time, but other than that, a perfect evening. ",5
" Vegetarian friendly. Decent food quality, great service, but more to hang out with friends than a foodie or special date night. Had an Italian sub that was overpriced for level Of quality. Pretzel basket serves 4 people very well. ",3
 We went there for my husbands birthday (his choice) and we had a great meal. Pretzel cheese fondue a must. I had the meatloaf and he had the Korean ribs. ,5
" We just had salads for lunch, but they were delicious and different.  Service was wonderful and the decor very interesting. ",5
 Everything ordered tasted amazing. The waitress had great recommendations. Overall a great experience! I do recommend a reservation in the evening though! ,5
" I loved the atmosphere here! I loved everything, from the lighting, to the decorations, to the food, to the staff. Our server was extremely patient with us and I was impressed with that, since we had a big group coming in. It was also my birthday and she offered me free desert, which is also a plus. ",5
 great food! great staff! great time! just in town visiting for the weekend and this was a perfect spot for a Saturday in Scottsdale ,5
" Food was good &amp; reasonably priced. Very loud inside, sometimes hard to hear across the table. Because the food and service was very good, we will go back. ",3
 Great menu with non traditional options.   Service was excellent.  Very friendly and helpful.   Relaxing atmosphere.   Highly recommended ,4
 I was taking my girlfriend out for her birthday and wanted her to have a special dinner. Everything went great and better when at the end of the dinner the staff surprised her woth a somg and some delicious desert ,4
" I would recommend Culinary Dropout to anyone who enjoys good food. In particular, the pretzels and cheese fondue are a must-get. The prices are a little high, but worth it in my opinion. ",4
" We were there celebrating my husband's bday and when I made the reservation I noted that but the staff did not acknowledge that. Also, three of my 6 guest received cold food from the kitchen. That was disappointing. ",4
" Very cool atmosphere,service was great and the selection on the menu is diverse ",5
 We had a reservation for 7:15 pm and didn't get seated until 7:45 pm. The notice was so loud we could barely hear conversation across the table. Our waitress was the only decent part of our night. We were less than thrilled with the overall experience at Culinary Dropout. ,2
" Went here for Az Restaurant week; what a bargain! $44 for two people and the food was wonderful. We had an awesome waitress, too. So attentive. I am so glad I tried this for AZ Restaurant week, I actually did not know how great this place was until today. What a great marketing tool.  Great interior space. Loved the design, but the food is the star here. Good affordable place for all. Kudos, Culinary Dropout! ",5
" I had the Gorgonzola Chicken Salad which had little, if any, gorgonzola flavor.  The other person with me had the house salad and a bowl of French Onion soup.  The soup was heavily flavored with beef broth and had little cheese in it.  We did have the house potato chips, which were good.  Overall, I was disappointed in the food.  They were crowded and it seemed like a great place to people watch.  There was live entertainment, which we enjoyed. ",2
" I made my reservation using opentable. Upon arrival (15 mins early) the inside of the restaurant had several open tables. The outside was busy except for lounge seating. They confirmed with us that we made the reservation with opentable and I said yes. They then told us that we may not be aware but by using that it means that we would be sitting outside. I said that was not clear and how long to be seated indoors (since it was 90 something degrees), she told me at least 30 mins. We said but us outside then which they did at a table comfortable for drinks and appetizers, not dinner. With having 5 people it was very uncomfortable. They did tell us to also call for a reservation next time and not us the app, ""it would be better for us"".   The food was good and server was nice. Our bill was over 200 which I would not do again there because of how we felt we were treated and heat. Small side note, I could see the main dining area and at not time was it full. Shame... ",3
" Ambiance is outstanding, drink list is wonderful! The food was very good but nothing wowing.. ",5
" Good variety of food &amp; drinks, really cool atmosphere &amp; the service was great. ",5
" I made a res on Open Table for my daughter's 8th birthday for Culinary Dropout.  It is my daughter's favorite restaurant.  I mentioned this in the comment section of the online reservation.  The only contact I had with the restaurant prior to lunch was to call the day before and ask to move the res by 15 minutes.  When we arrived at the restaurant, there were birthday decorations, balloons, party hats, and special straws.  The manager had called the waitress (Jaime) before she even came into work and asked her to pick up the decorations on her way into work.  They did all of this without asking and without expectation in return.  I was so elated.  It made it that much more special and fun for both my daughter and me.  On top of it all, the food was fantastic (as always at a Fox Restaurant). ",5
 All was fine except music volume was too loud. Service was excellent and very friendly. Atractive interior as well. ,4
" With exception service and outstanding food, it is an outstanding place to take first time visitors to the area for a lunch time get together. ",5
" We wanted to go to Culinary Dropout for the food and speak-easy feel for a flapper themed bachelorette party. The food was amazing, the drinks were delicious, but even more we had amazing service. Not only was our server so sweet and accommodating to a large group, but everyone there was very friendly. From the confirmation of the reservation, to graciously splitting our tab start to finish was a wonderful night. Thanks for helping us celebrate! ",5
" Every time we are in Scottsdale we make it a point to stop at Culinary Dropout.  Comfort food fit for foodies, great vibe and drinks. Soft pretzels and fondue are a great start. Our server, Jake was very attentive. ",5
" Extremely disappointed at how we were treated. After making a reservation, I was called to tell me that wouldn't work and I couldn't come in unless we left at a certain time. Then they moved us halfway through the meal. Not how you should treat guests ",2
" We booked our reservation using the Open Table app while poolside at the Firesky Resort. The app made everything so simple. When we arrived at Culinary Dropout we were seated immediately. Our server was very pleasant and mindful, without being intrusive. I had a White Russian to drink which was perfectly made. We had the pretzels with cheese fondue as a starter. The dish was excellent, but more than two people can finish if you still want an appetite for dinner.  My fiancé had the ribs, which was a large enough order it could easily feed two people. The meat was excellent. I had the turkey pastrami on a pretzel roll style bun. I enjoyed the flavor, but felt it was a little salty. Also the turkey used, looked like something I could've purchased at a supermarket deli.  The quantity of turkey was impressive, and I was unable to eat the entire sandwich. The atmosphere was very nice. There are multiple TVs with sports being broadcasted and it has an overall fun feeling. ",4
 Food presentation beautiful! No problem adjusting for lactose needs.  Very tender steak paired with asparagus and golden roasted potatoes melted with each bite!  Delicious chocolate fancy dessert.  Other parties in the group enjoyed a gourmet burger and fish/chips along with almonds prepared in deliciously in olive oil as an appetizer along with several other choices of which we chose assorted olives!  Very lively for a Thursday night!  Our out of town guest was very pleased and we will definitely return. ,5
 We have been to Culinary Dropout for lunch and then tried dinner. The four of us had the fried chicken which we all enjoyed. It was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside with honey a part of the coating. The mashed potatoes and gravy and the coleslaw were also very good. Our server was very knowledgeable and was attentive to our needs. The place is very noisy at night and we enjoyed it more at lunch because it was quieter. Be aware that for dinner entrees there is a limited menu and there were no specials. ,4
 This restaurant was fantastic.  They found out it was our anniversary and treated us like royalty. The managers went our of their way to make us feel extra special.  We will never forget the service on our special night. ,5
 Great food value. Always wonderful service. Great drinks. A casual but good place to go out. Their charcuterie options are plentiful and those portions generous. ,5
 Cool restaurant.  Great for a group of girls to laugh! We ordered a variety of items to share. ,4
 Very accommodating to large parties. ,4
 Excellent choice for down home cooking that's better than what mom makes.  Great fried chicken and meatloaf.  Cocktails were perfectly made.  Noise level is high and diners can watch a variety of sports. ,5
" Loved this restaurant! Great food, spectacular service and great even with a toddler! Excited to return! Especially knowing the meat is hormone free!! ",5
" We had a reservation but we're made to wait about 15 minutes before being seated.  We were also told that a ""very important group"" needed to be seated and our wait for the table may be affected by that.  I guess we were not considered very important.  The host offered us cocktails as an apology then told us to talk to the GM if we wanted those cocktails.  ???  Food was good, server was good.  Initial welcome - not so good. ",3
 Server was good but took too long to take order. Fried chicken (was recommended to me) was overcooked (coating too crunchy to eat). Salmon was overcooked as well. Drink menu is interesting and unique. ,4
 The drinks were really good..mixed..they were creative and taste. We started at the bar and then sat down for dinner. The menu is limited so it really works as a bar menu. The food was good. The problem was that it was soon hot inside. It was 108 degrees outside and they opened every window and door in the place..probably to try and entice people to come to the bar. But it was ridiculous. We were way inside and could feel the heat all the way in back. We ended up and left and went next door. the staff was delightful and service was very good. If the temp was better I would give this a much better review. ,3
" Food lived up to expectations as did the service.  However, the high ceilings and wooden floor and crowded tables made for for a terrible din as the evening went on.  We were dining with friends to catch up and mostly, we two could only talk to the person next to ourselves, couldn't hear the others even across a small table.  I would go back but not on a Saturday night! ",3
" While we all know Sam Fox has many successful concepts this one isn't his best.  The live music on the weekend is just way to loud. You can hardly hear yourself think on what to order and don't even think about talking to your company unless you are shouting. The wait staff all looked like they came from a class on learning how to dress hipster /boho chic. One girl wasn't even wearing a bra- and she really should have. That's just unprofessional. The waitstaff was slow and yes, there were multiple large parties in our area inside and more outside and we were just two but we sat for more than 10 minutes without someone even dropping some waters down. Once we finally ordered food was fast. We didn't order drinks so I don't think our server really cared about us and we had to ask twice to get our water refilled. We are both in our late twenties/early 30's so this isn't an old couple reviewing this place. Maybe we will try again on another night sans live music, or maybe we will stick to the other Fox concepts we enjoy. ",4
" Great food, creative drinks, killer caramel custard thing for dessert! Just really noisy inside, but outside by the misters worked out fine for us. Service was awesome ",4
" Great place to bring out of town guests for an urban scene.  Prompt and attentive service, solid and tasty menu for multiple palates. ",5
 Quirky restaurant serving decent food with an eclectic range of servers.  Had a reasonable meal which was not too expensive.  The fried chicken is worth going for! ,4
" We liked the overall style and ambiance. Our server was attentive and delightful. Cocktails were good, presentation of the food was good, unfortunately the taste was mediocre. We didn't order anything past the appys. ",3
 Service friendly and efficient.  Food excellent  Enjoyable experience.  Will definitely return ,4
" The food was good. However, it could have been seasoned a little more for me. ",4
" I came to Culinary Dropout on Camelback  for dinner with girl friends while visiting Scottsdale. We LOVED the vibe at the restaurant. Fresh decor, fun, real menu (cheap house salad-ha!) with all kinds of food I love, busy with interesting people and friendly service (particularly at the bar). Totally enjoyed the appetizer (we built our own from the anitpasti menu-that was fantastic, though the bread was a bit too crunchy). However our dinner entrees were less than pleasing. First, everything was cold. I mean everything. Fries, potatoes, steak, salmon. None of it was hot. We ordered one late entree for a late arriving friend. His came out fast and hot. Ours, slow and cold. My food (steak and potatoes) was pretty good as far as taste goes. The Gorgonzola sauce was more ""sauce"" than ""Gorgonzola"" and the asparagus was a little woody, but the steak {pieces} were prepared medium rare and were as expected. Overall, it was edible, but not amazing. The salmon entree-totally not good. The salmon appeared to have been pan fried. So there was a crispy, coating around the overcooked salmon inside. It was not good, and certainly not prepared medium as the server recommended, and we desired. We are from the Pacific Northwest and that is just NOT how salmon is prepared at a good restaurant. Or even a pub. That was disappointing. My other friend had the ribs. They tasted fine and were tender. But again, cold, as were the fries. Iverall I would recommend this place as a fun spot to get a drink and an appetizer, but I don't know that I'd risk the $25 entrees again. Maybe a burger next time? ",3
" Wait staff is excellent, knowledgeable, and fun.  Food is v. good.  The ""list"" of ""starter"" options that you are presented with when you first sit at your table is a bit of low value item for the customer but a great little money maker for the restaurant - the portions are too small.  I think some explanation by the wait staff re:  ""the list"" would be helpful and I would have felt less ripped off - just saying. Good people watching. ",4
" This restaurant does not offer any celebrational signing, dancing or even a bowl of icecream. ",3
 Service was top notch. The welcome girls at the front door were very friendly. Beer was cold. Foot was hot. Presentation was excellent. Overall a great experience. ,5
" Food was awesome. Although the menu for happy hour was small, everything in it was excellent. Portions were generous even during happy hour. The patio was spacious and airy and the noise level was low. ",5
" This was my first time here and i am definitely coming back. Descent beer list with a good number of craft and local taps, bottles and cans. Definitely order the pretzel balls with cheese sauce. Great appetizer for sharing. Burgers were big and juicy with lots of flavor. ",4
 Visited this spot a few months ago. Enjoyed it a lot but never wrote a review. Was sitting at dinner last night at one of those restaurants where you need a dictionary for every other word when we started thing about our previous experience at Culinary Dropout.    Realized how much we enjoyed the experience and thought we should share. Will visit again when we are back in Scottsdale area next winter.  Would be a regular spot if we lived in the area. ,5
 Enjoyed a great meal with friends. The Korean Ribeye was wonderful and fit the requirements of my diet. One friend had a hamburger and was completely satisfied. The ladies in our group had large salads and were very satisfied as well. We were seated on time and our service was good. ,5
 Took and a chance an was rewarded with one of the best dining experiences on our trip...we will be back ,5
" We came on a Sunday night and the spot wasn't very crowded. The service was wonderful! Our waitress was very bubbly and personable. The restaurant manager, Matt, came to our table to make sure our experience was going well. We felt very taken care of! They have tapas style plates for appetizers. We got almonds, olives, salami and manchego - all very Spanish and very good! For entrees, my boyfriend and I both got fish; I the salmon and him the rainbow trout. The salmon was good and the trout was very good! We'll definitely be back. The customer service alone will make us loyal patrons. ",4
" What a fun vibe! We picked a bit of a chilly windy evening for outdoor dining but it was fun and tasty, especially the pretzel ball app. Good for a casual night out. Lively and busy. ",4
" Tried it on a recommendation while in town for Giant's Spring Training and were not  disappointed.  The worst part was the parking.  A little noisy for our likes, but the quality of the food washed out a lot of the noise.  Will go back the next time we are in town.  Go Giants!!! ",5
" First, a friend recommended Culinary Drop Out as THE place to go in Scottsdale.  So we went, without reservations.  Second, we were given the best seat in, or outside of the house.  The left front corner seat; more quiet, great people watching point and a view of the TV for March Madness madness.   Third, we had a fantastic server/dinner partner in Jessica.  She was energetic, fun and knew everything about the menu.  Fourth, we had a great meal; from the appetizer plate of meats and cheeses, to the deviled eggs with a touch of truffle oil, to the port belly toast (great!), to our dinner  of Famous Fried Chicken (huge plate with mashed potatoes and gravy) to my Ribeye Cap (perfectly cooked and with some heat).  And finally, to top it off, some of the best caramel corn in the world.  This place is fun, energetic, is full of employees who want to be there and makes dining out worth it. ",5
 The four of us absolutely loved this place. Great food and even better atmosphere. Will definitely visit this restaurant again when I am back in Phoenix. ,5
 Loved the big round table with the over-sized chairs.  It was perfect for our group of four.  I would definitely go back and request that same table. ,4
" We had a late lunch here at about 2pm; the place was pretty busy, and the music was a little too loud. However, all of the employees were extremely friendly and helpful.   The pretzel fondue was excellent; I think we could have been happy with just that. We had the buffalo chicken meatballs, which were good, and the fish and chips, which was good but unexceptional. I would definitely eat here again, but maybe sit on the patio, where it seemed to be quieter. ",4
" This is my favorite restaurant in Scottsdale.  Unfortunately, something was amiss the night we went.  Service was very slow, food was not served timely or together. Appetizer was served before cocktails.  Hopefully, this was a one time occurrence. ",1
" We decided to just go ""tapas"" style so we could try all the appetizer &amp; salad selections.  There were many choices that an entre wasn't needed.  Food was delicious.  The meat and cheese board were good except that it would have been nice to have crackers or bread with it.  Service was great.  Ashley was our server and was very accommodating with us putting in addional orders as we finished a set of appetizers.  She did not ignore our kids but even refilled their drinks without us having to ask.  She anticipated our needs and was thoughtful to have our salad split as we were sharing everything.  With the service we received, we will definitely come back soon. ",4
 Went with a party of 8 from out of town. There were some really great interpretations of classic Italian food. ,5
" The food here was incredible!  Only two complaints.  I thought you had the valet included, like the other Culinary Dropout in downtown Phoeinix.  Wrong.  They charged and that didn't include the tip.  Wasn't expecting that.  Plus the volume of the music was so high you couldn't hear who was netxt to you.  We requested that it get turned down and they did...for awhile.  Then they turned it back up  We had to leave because we couldn't converse.  Service and food was fabulous though. ",4
" I was disappointed at their service and handling of big parties. They assigned a single server for a party of 15 failing to refill drinks and to attend to small requests. A second hand would have been helpful, especially when there were approximately 4 greeters/servers standing by the front  door. They brought out two plates 15 minutes after 12 other plates and they completely forgot to bring my order. They realized my plate was missing once my party had finished their meal. The server said he would contact  the manager who never came  out to at least apologize. Ihad to request a manager who was conpletely unaware of the situation. At the end they reduced the bill total and offered other credits, but it still was a poor experience and my party was not impressed,especially since I had originally given it too much hype. ",2
 Great food at a reasonable price . Love the music on weekends. ,5
" Small menu, great food and service.  We will go again. ",5
" We had guests from out of town and wanted to invite them to a place with good food and have visit with them but it was way too LOUD, the waitress had to literally yell out answers to questions. It was very dark, had to use cell phones to read menus and the AC was set very cold, this was at PM on a Wed. evening. ",2
 The sweet potato cannelloni was divine.  Not to be missed. ,5
" The overal experience was awesome. Our server, Mitch was polite, fast and attentive. The atmosphere is vibrant, cost was right in line, and the overall experience was great. Definitely a recommend for anyone! ",5
" and even if you are full, order the bourbon black bottom pie and share it. Of course, this is only if you like gooey, chocolate/caramel graham cracker crust goodness. We've eaten at about 200 restaurants in the Phoenix area and this is a top dessert. My wife also enjoyed her crispy shrimp salad and liked my kale salad with salmon on top. parking is free below ground; enter off Camelback and look for Valet drop off sign ($6) or turn left to park yourself). Crusty bread and olive oil are extra ($3) but nicely done. ",5
" We haven celebrated our anniversary for the past 3 years with dinner at Ditskas.  Each time we have had an excellent dinner and a special anniversary dessert compliments of the restaurant.  Great service, we would definitely recommend. ",5
" I just discovered this west valley gem and I will definitely be going back!  Who knew?  The food and service were phenomenal, and the prices (while not inexpensive) were in line with the quality of the dishes.  Everything from fish / seafood to old-fashioned comfort food.  Fantastic! ",4
 Everything was exceptional from seating to service! ,4
 We love coming here. Not many good places to eat in Laveen but the staff is always great and so is the food. Very quiet even with the casino floor right there. ,5
 The food was incredible. The atmosphere was very relaxing and the service was excellent. ,5
" I would recommend this restaurant for special occasions or casual dining. Very elegant, clean, quiet, great service, and the food is wonderful. ",5
 It was a great experience. The service was great and very friendly. It was the perfect place to sit and eat as well as having good conversation.  It was my first time eating at Ditka's. I will be coming to eat there again in the future. Thanks again for the great experience. ,4
" We had a family get together at Ditka's and the food and service was excellent.  The manager who oversees the operation, Steve, is always friendly and makes a great Tom Collins.  Will be back again soon!!! ",5
" Server was rude, there wasn't any gravy for the southern fried chicken, hardly anyone was there (possibly due to the high menu prices), server was walking around staring at things because he didn't seem to have anything to do, and when I got up to find him for my friend's birthday surprise, there was a graphic conversation going on among employees ",3
" I have been to other Ditka's and always had a great meal. This location was not the quality I expect from a Ditka's. The bread roll was good the wine was excellent. The rest of the meal was tasteless from the Caesar salad, red potatoes, asparagus and steak fillet's we had.  No butter or seasonings on any of it. The salad dressing was really sweet and nothing like Caesar dressing.   I think someone needs to work with the chef there and turn this around. The place was really empty. Another thing I have never experienced at a Ditka's. So I think the food is why.  Thanks. ",3
 Steak was not as good as before.  To much gristle but the rest was excellent. ,4
" food for the price was great ,  the service was horrible it took an hour for a glass of  wine have to remind the waive 4 time ,then she came back to ask us what kind  we had order ,my prime was good cook right mushroom  very good  salmon was increbidle  , the dominican steak was very good heavy rub  dessert menu good selections ch cake was a 10   the manager apologize for the service  if you want a salede get the blue cheese wedge ",3
" This is in a casino. Be prepared to be pelted with noise and cigarette smoke before getting to the restaurant. Our server, Amanda, was awesome. The Mike’s Salad was delicious. ",5
 Food was fair - low quality meet. Waiter did not seem aware of what specials were available or size of portions ,3
" This is definitely a hidden neighborhood gem.  The ambiance of the restaurant could easily be an intimate setting, but large enough to handle good size parties.  This was the first visit and most likely not the last.  I ordered the crab bisque for an appetizer and steak salad for my entree.   It doesn't happen often, in fact I can't remember the last time, but I couldn't finish my salad.  Costs are reasonable, the servers are attentive and the quality of your meal is better an anticipated.  The other meal consisted of sweet potatoes, and some kind of meat entree.  Regretfully, I can't remember, but I can share with you that the plate was clear and someone was looking like a satisfied customer.  Nice job! ",4
" Always love Ditkas, very pretty inside, great food, great service. I have been there several times And will visit again.  Thank you for a great evening!! ",5
" Very good service and food was delish, went here for my birthday and did a little gambling after! Great atmosphere ",5
 Good service but my crusted steak was more crust then steak. I could barely test it. ,5
" We both had their Friday special of the day , which was a fish fry. The fish on both dinners was not done properly, where the fish was flakey white, so we sent them back. They remade them both and they were not done right either. We are both lovers of fish fried, have been to LOTS of them, but never had fish that was so bad! We won't go back. ",2
" It was our first time their for our wedding anniversary and it won't be our last! The food was delicious. Our server was very friendly and amazing. The manager, Steve, took the time to get to know us. Can't wait to go back! ",5
 Best calamari I have had in 17 years in Phoenix.  Friends really enjoyed Meatloaf and Seafood Pasta. ,4
 We had the rib eye steak dinner with dinner salad. The food was great. ,4
" The service was great.  We had been here twice before and found the ribs and steak weren't as great as we had remembered (maybe a new Cook), but it was still good.  The slab of ribs is huge, enough for two people.  The prices were very affordable for a special occasion. ",4
" Our meal was amazing! We tried the caesar  salad, crab cakes, New York strip steak and the Meatloaf! All to die for! ",5
" Excellent Service, Food and atmosphere.  Anniversary dinner and they made it great. ",5
" We had been to Ditka's twice before.  Our first time was great, our second was horrible so we decided to try it one more time.  We went early and were the only couple in the place.  My wife had the Maui Maui over risotto and she said it was very good.  I had the Fried Shrimp over French fries with cole slaw and it too was very good.  We each had the Crab Bisque soup to start out with and it was delicious.  By the time we left, only two other couples came in.  Ditka's is a nice place located in the Vee Quiva Casino but I feel the clientele is not a group of people that will keep Ditka's in business.  Service was good but there were 5-6 staff members just hanging out at the front desk chit chatting.  You could tell they were bored due to the low amount of clients in the restaurant. ",4
" Good but not great. Great service, food ok. Had the 29$ three course dinner, good value and fun. Will go back. ",4
" The filet mignon was not properly cooked. I ordered my steak at a medium rare, the middle was still frozen solid. The waiters resolution was to ""heat it up"". When they came back with the steak it was still cold. I was very excited to try Ditka's for the first time but was very disappointed in the way the food was prepared. Especially after spending 130.00 dollars. ",2
 I was surprised to find freshwater Perch on the menu. It was very good. We like this restaurant. We have been to the Chicago restaurant also and although they are quite different we like them both. You'll see us again. ,5
" The food was very good.  Service was excellent as Ray took exceptional care of us.  Unfortunately, the ambiance was tainted by the strong smell of stale smoke coming in from the casino.  What a shame!  Too bad as I cannot recommend this place to anyone and we will not be returning. ",2
" I am still dreaming of Ditka's!  What an amazing meal we had there a few nights ago.  There were three of us and we had the nightly special for $29.99 which was  HUGE value.  The crab bisque was so rich, creamy, and positively delish!  Then my ribeye?  Well, at first I was worried because it looked a little thin so I worried that it would be overcooked and not very tasty.  WRONG!  It was so juicy and flavorful and the accompanying sides of potatoes and asparagus were great as well.  Then the icing on the cake?  OMG the cheesecake!  Fab-u-lous! ",5
 our server was very nice she was very pleasant to our needs. all the staff the made sure were ok were very friendly.  great customer service from all your staff ,5
 Lovely garden setting.    Great description of each menu item by server. ,4
" The service was outstanding.  I was told by a friend that they had an amazing pineapple martini but they were out of pineapple so no martini.  There were three of us and one of my friends was willing to split the Big 20 oz steak and they had split the steak for us on two plates at no extra charge.  Most places do charge extra for splitting.   Unfortunately, the steak  was spoiled.  Once we informed the manager, he took care of it immediately and replaced our meal with prime rib.  He was very apologetic.  The prime rib was delicious.  We also ordered cheesecake for dessert and it was amazing.  However, do not know if we would give it another try but like I stated in the beginning, the service was outstanding-maybe I will call ahead to make sure they have pineapple just to try martini-still anxious to try one or maybe I will try chicken.  I would like to say Thank You to the manager and because of him, maybe I will try Ditkas again. ",4
 Absolutely fabulous experience!  I will be returning soon...loved everything! ,4
" Fantastic food and top shelf service. If you want prime rib, Wednesday is the best day. Any of the seafood and freshwater fish selections are excellent as well.   Eat here!!! ",5
 This was an anniversary with a special surprise gift for my husband.  The service started out great but by the time we finished our main course we waited for quite some time for the table to be cleared while we watched our server stand at the hostess station.  And the reservation was marked as a special occasion of anniversary but they never acknowledged.  The food was good but the lack of attention to detail made the dining experience less than ideal. ,3
" Enjoyed Ditkas, and found it to be a great value with very high quality.  Bit puzzled as to lack of crowd given that it was really good and a good price, but could be result of location SW of Phoenix ",4
" The food was delicious!  We had Prime Rib and salad and twice baked potatoes.   Awesome good food. BUT.   They got our drinks wrong and wouldn't remake them. That really upset my husband because it was our Aniversary and I don't usually drink. They were training the server which made her feel really bad. Wasn't her fault she got it right, they didn't. We told the manager, but he said policy they cannot remake the drink.   That is obsurd!   They make a mistake and they don't make it over?  Very Dissappointed! ",4
" Ran out of bread, slow service, over cooked food , advertised specials not available. Not a pleasant night, would not recommend ",3
" If you were expecting the Ditka's from Chicago, you will be disappointed.  I'd compare it to a Chili's inside of a Casino.   If you are expecting Chili's quality, menu selection, and wait staff quality, you'll be happy with Ditka's. ",3
" The staff are always very knowledgeable, cheery, and helpful. Great cocktails, great wine list, great menu. ",5
 Noise level was off the charts. Had to almost yell to have a conversation. Unfortunate. ,4
" Virtu was highly recommended and it delivered.  To start the Polpo was fabulous, but so too was the Oriecchie and the Asparagi.  We followed that up with both kinds of pasta, where the Gnocci was the standout.  We threw in a few scallops to go along with the Ribeye and we were set.  The Ribeye was a bit tough for me and undercooked, but flavorful and traditional.  The dessert was delicious and the service was great.  I go back at the end fo the month! ",5
 We love Virtu - it was a Bday lunch ,5
 Exceptional. Ivan was our server. He was the best. Great recommendations for our dinner. We split the spaghetti which is nothing like I’ve had before truly unique. Our entree s were fabulous. After we placed our order we walked around Bespoke...it’s a beautiful boutique hotel. When returning to our table our napkins were perfectly rolled back up. They do not miss a beat. Will most definitely dine there again. Absolutely loved it. ,5
 Very unusual and adventurous menu. Unusual wine list. ,5
 We were there for brunch. It was very nice. Good food and service in a great setting. ,5
 First time.  It was fantastic.  The food was outstanding.  A little snafu.  They forgot one of our pasta dishes. But were fine when we noted it. ,5
" Beautiful night. Great patio. Prompt, attentive service but food was all in the two to four star range. No disasters but nothing memorable.  The house specialty octopus was perfectly cooked but the seasoning was quite salty. We’ve had better. The pate was good as was the gnocchi but both the scallops and halibut entrees were undistinguished. Not on our return list. ",3
 Virtu staff always nails it! Introduced some friends to Virtu since we are all foodies. Did not disappoint and reminds me of a New York restaurant.... with a gorgeous patio. Always one of my favorites and it is tucked away off the beaten path of Old Town. ,5
" Beautiful setting, great food, wonderful service/ ",5
 Have been to Virtu for dinner and now brunch and both times have been phenomenal.  Really love this place!  The pork ragú and grilled octopus were amazing! ,5
" Absolutely remarkable!  Drinks, menu, food, presentation, staff all amazing.  This was truly a top 5 meal for my wife and I. Chef-stay true and keep exploring!  This is now my go to! ",5
" A group of 4 had a table on the patio the evening of February 1.  The ambience was lovely with table candles and lights - there was little to no street noise.  A patio heater provided all of the heat necessary.  Matt our waiter was fantastic - knowledgeable about the menu, affable and fun.   We enjoyed the menu which featured a limited number of the chef's choices for the evening rather than an overabundance of options.  Two ordered the fish of the day, one the scallops and one duck.  All dishes were amazing - each with its own unique take on the ingredients and combinations of ingredients.  We highly recommend the sticky chocolate toffee pudding cake with gelato.  One of our member ordered 2 plus one to take home.  (we helped him eat it of course!). There are no promises regarding certain limited diets/allergies and the chef will not make substitutions, so be warned if that will be a problem. ",5
" We celebrated my husband's birthday with you, and it was our first time dining at Virtu.  It was a delightful evening and far exceeded our expectations.  Our wait person was outstanding and provided just the right level of assistance and prompt service in a most genuine way.  Every dish we tried, including the butterscotch pudding (who knew a pudding could be so sensational) and warm chocolate cake, was delicious and every morsel was consumed.  The craft cocktails were an added bonus!  Even with a large, noisy party next to us we found sitting on the patio very cozy and comfortable.  Thank you for a memorable evening on our first visit to Scottsdale. ",5
 Our meal under the stars was a special birthday treat with another couple. Service was wonderful - at last servers trained not to but into conversations just to ask unnecessary questions.  Every dish was a delight! ,5
" The chef and staff obviously care about your meal - from the cocktail to the innovative dishes, beautiful courtyard and outdoor dining compliment the cuisine and service. ",5
 We enjoyed our time at the bar and dinner.  Food and service are great.  There was an air of pretentiousness with both the bartender and waiter.  A bit too serious about their craft and uniqueness.  We laughed it off and had a good time. ,4
" We were in Phoenix for a wedding.  Virtu was amazing.  Food was excellent, service superb.  Highly recommend. ",5
 Exceptional! Excellent on every level! ,5
 1st time for both guests. Waiter was very knowledgeable on all food &amp; drink choices. Tables a little close together. Definitely will be back to see Chef's new creations. ,5
" We simply cannot get enough of Virtu!  While we were only in Scottsdale for 3 days, we ended up dining here 3 times - it is just that good (brunch and dinner)!! ",5
" Sat outdoors. Lovely setting. Waiter was outstanding. We let him basically make most of the selections. Enjoyed a wide variety of palate pleasing appetizers and entrees, but always start with the grilled octopus. . Couldn’t have been happier. A great evening. ",5
" Loved Virtu!  Had been recommended by a good friend, and I finally made a reservation and met a good friend for lunch and catching up .... we both enjoyed it immensely!  Lovely outdoor patio table, divine food (octopus was incredible), creative drinks, perfect service.  It was a little slice of Heaven on every score! ",5
" The best asparagus I've ever had.  The food, service and atmosphere were excellent! ",5
 Terrific food  by knowledgeable service staff! Such a delightful meal in lovely setting! The Chef has amazing talent and so very creative! ,5
 One of the Best we’ve experienced in a long time ,5
" Food was an artistic reflection of the chef, the wine list was a great compliment of the food.  Amazing ",5
 We had a wonderful meal—the octopus and gnocchi were some of the best I have ever had! The butterscotch pudding was also amazing! ,5
" Wonderful in every respect: food, service, and ambience. Kudos to the chef for an outstanding and creative meal. I would highly recommend this restaurant to those who appreciate fine dining/elevated cuisine. ",5
" Fabulous brunch food, and dessert! We enjoyed conversing with people dining at neighboring tables. ",5
" One of the best meals we've had in a long time.  Fantastic food prepared in unusual and delicious ways.  And really fun atmosphere.  Our waitress was super knowledgeable, made great suggestions, we loved every  course.  Can't recommend it enough. ",5
" Waiter was not aware of the wines that were listed on the by the glass menu. Also, stated that the lentils were not soupy but they had to be eaten with a spoon. ",3
" Excellent service, great food and amazing staff. It is a beautiful restaurant, very cozy. ",5
" Excellent meals. Wonderful, friendly service. Lovely dinner with our 2-year-old sitting outside on the patio. ",4
 Enjoying friends ,5
" Excellent service by Evan this evening, and all other service providers have been very good - professional and friendly.  Menu has ample selection for all courses, but not too many as to be overwhelming.  We were a group of 6 and we shared appetizers, all which were very good, in particular the octopus which was extremely tasty and tender.  Everyone enjoyed their entrees which were perfectly prepared with the freshest of ingredients. ",5
 If you can only have one meal in the Phoenix area it should be here.  Beautiful food and setting. ,5
" We saved Virtu Honest Craft for our last night in Phoenix. We were not only not disappointed, but were thrilled with the experience we had there. We travel a LOT and I would put it at one of the top meals in memory. The plate selections were wonderful and eclectic. The wine list was diverse, and the service was impeccable. We had two small plates and split a large plate. They not only were accommodating, but served the large plate already split on two beautiful plates. Virtu Honest Craft is definitely on the top of our list for our next trip to the Phoenix area. ",5
 Love this place...BEST SALADS and PAVLOVA ever....and their pizza crust is super thin. Truly a favorite for me and friends. ,5
 Base is our neighborhood pizza place. It is consistent and the ingredients fresh. We love the owners! ,5
 Love this place ,5
" Seated right away and made to feel welcome. The waiter was very personable, answered questions and explained how the food would come out. We didn't feel rushed. Great salads and pizzas. Drinks were pricey, but water was plentiful. Lovely atmosphere. Australian owners. Never left waiting and lots of smiles. They happily took photos for us and were helpful with ordering and portion sizes. Our 2nd time there. I'm sure we'll be back. ",4
" LOVE this place! LOVE The Pavlova and yummy food, and great wines. ",5
 Base is perfection. Outstanding food and outstanding friendly service.  We love it every time! ,5
 The food was fabulous.  We will definitely go back! ,5
" The bruschetta is amazing, the service was wonderful and the outdoor view was enough to go back again. ",5
" The food and service, as always, was great.  I cannot recall our waitresses name but we were impressed that she could recall my daughter's custom pizza. That and the rest of the great service made for a really pleasant night. ",4
 We were there on the first evening cool enough to sit outside this summer and that was the best part. The pizza was very average as was the salad. There are many better and less expensive  options. ,4
 We love this restaurant.  They are so nice and we go every Tuesday night.  Since our anniversary was on a Tues we went and they gave us complimentary Champaign.  The best.  Jack and Diane ,5
" We LOVE Base. Tuesdays all pizzas are half price. The Doughman's Platter is decadent. Best charcuterie board we have ever seen. You will not be hungry after sharing this platter. They recently introduced a vegan pizza (one of us is vegan). Regular pizza's are very creative, something for everyone. Owners are so friendly and warm. ",5
 Always interesting choices. The Amalfi salad is incredible. I think it's great that the owners wait on you and aim to please. ,5
" Wonderful salad &amp; pizza!  Interesting flavors, simple, healthy eating.  Nice atmosphere. Very attentive service. We'll go back when we can try the wines &amp; dessert. ",5
 This place continues to be amazing. Both for the food. And the service  ..  Go here!  Now what are you waiting for? ,5
 Did not disclose a large 35 person party when I called to confirm reservation.  Was interviewing a candidate in a casual setting but it was way too loud and we were rather small fish in a big pond.  Not likely to go back. ,3
" WE LOVE IT THERE. Food as always amazing as well as the owners! Try their breakfast/lunch place called ""The Smith"" on Indian School Rd near 32nd ",5
 Love this place. Owners very nice. Their  Ploughman Platter (cheese/meats/etc) AMAZING ,5
 This has become my #1 spot in all of Phoenix. It was the best experience possible. I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone and everyone. I'll be back for sure ,5
" Pizza so-so. $18 for a margarita pizza with pesto mozzarella is steep.  Guess I wouldn't mi d if the crust/flavors/ingredients were amazing but sadly it wasn't.  Spinach, pear, pecan salad so-so. Mostly just spinach. Don't rush. ",2
 Awesome place.  Super friendly owners and staff.  The food is to die for.  Great pizza and salads.  Great beer.  Owners are from Australia so great accent too!! ,5
" My friend and I had wanted to try this restaurant for some time.  The pizza  and the salad we tried were very good, and there were specials with innovative choices but we wanted to try a more basic pizza for comparison.  They hit it!  Our server was one of the co-owners and he was a treat.  The owners are Australian and were familiar with the folks at Craft 64, which we also enjoy.  A great addition to the wonderful pizza places we have in the valley. ",4
 Great food and very friendly service.  We have been twice and look forward to going again. ,5
" I can only say that this restaurant/pizzeria is out of this world. The decor is clean, crisp and inviting, and the food was spectacular. The staff was upbeat and friendly and it's definitely a restaurant not to miss. It will be a never miss when in Scottsdale. ",5
 We always love coming to Base! ,5
 Waitress seemed new.  Did not know menu items and brought in correct items.  Food is amazing so still worth dining there ,4
 We love Base Pizzeria and the entire staff! The service and food are outstanding. ,5
 Awesome!!  Great service.  Owner was super nice.  Service outstanding . This is a great neighborhood find.  Will be back for sure.  Loved everything about it.  Great views.  Beer choices were spot on. ,5
 Wonderful restaurant. The staff is amazing and the food is consistently great. ,5
" Awesome food! The charcuterie board (the big one) was the best we have ever had. Served with Noble bread, all sorts of meats, cheeses, fruit and different spreads. We each had pizza and both ",5
 Everything was delicious! ,5
 Service slow. Pizza barely warm but good. Setting is great if you can eat outside. Great share salads ,3
 Probably the best pizza I have had in town if not anywhere.  Add to this the fact that the salads are terrific and the wine/beer options are well done and you have an ideal place to go.  The owners and staff are also very kind and fun so the environment suits the food.  Its like that commercial - I don't always eat pizza but when I do I make it Base. ,5
 Interesting and tasty choices in pizzas.  A wonderful ambiance of family owned and operated establishment.  We wIll return often! ,5
" Great place - fun, neighborhood atmosphere; good food; and best of all the very friendly Australian staff who truly make the evening. Plan to make this a regular dining out joint. ",5
 Great food and good service. Nice atmosphere. Our group loves it. ,5
" BEST PIZZA EVER! The homemade spicy pepper infused olive oils are an outstanding topping for the pizza! The service is amazing - the owners are incredibly nice, friendly, and  welcoming! ",4
 Very fun for family dinner!!! ,5
" Absolutely loved our first visit to Base! The outdoor seating area had a great mountain view, it was quiet, the owners were the servers and they were friendly, helpful, and really great to chat with. It's apparent that they love their business and that's something I really appreciate. Fantastic food, great ambiance, and great people. We'll certainly be back! ",5
 Love this place. Always fantastic food. Service is always great. Family owned… Organic delicious food! Can't beat it. ,5
" EXCELLENT.......as always!! Food, Service, Ambiance, on and on!! ",5
 Always crowded..even on a Tuesday. Food is quite nice and service excellent ,5
" Very disappointing.  This place is known for ribs and our ribs at home are better!  Our baked and twice baked potatoes were burnt.  Prices were high for what we had. Would have liked good bread with the meal; not crackers, etc. We were sat a table in the middle of this packed room, did not feel comfortable. Waited a long time for food to come. ",3
 Great food and great service ,5
 Absolutely GREAT. My first time and now my favorite. Will be back ,5
" Very impressive with new waitress. Stephanie was delightful and efficient, a very nice person.  Service was quick too.  Food was great as always. ",5
 Great food with fabulous service. The memorabilia is plentiful too!  Love this restaurant. It’s one of our favorites and it never disappoints. ,5
" Be sure to try the bone in rib eye. Exceptional. Great menu, many selections for return visits. Desserts are decadent and delicious. ",5
" everything here is fantastic. the best baked potato and cole slaw ever.  great broasted chicken, to chicken snitzel, to fantastic steaks, the best prime rib, and of course the most amazing ribs. ",5
 Don and Charlie’s is somewhere we eat whenever we are in Scottsdale. We’ve been going over 25 years. Lots of sports memorabilia and great food. Never a disappointment. ,5
 We haven't been here in a few years and I can't figure out why.....this was awesome. Becky was a GREAT server and even though it was packed we never felt like we waited. The food was awesome and that turtle pie was amazing. We won't wait so long to come back again. ,5
" great food and service - altho I think the restaurant really needs updating . .it's dark, filled with memorbilia but looks dirty.   The golf tourney is in town so it's great to see the restaurant busy, however, the noise level was off the charts . . ",4
" Such a fun environment.  Even on a Wednesday night, it was hopping.   Good food and people watching! ",5
" A solid choice for steak or char crusted ribs. I use to like going when Shelley was behind the bar. Ever since her departure, it is not the same. Consequently I go there far less frequently. ",3
" Great classic old steak/bbq restaurant.  Ask for Pam, she was great! definite repeat. ",5
 Great service and great food made for a very enjoyable evening. Our server recommended dishes for us to try. We loved the Shrimp Scampi Chicago Style and  the Filet Duo was delicious. Our waitress Mary also recommended the Creme Brulee which was outrageous. ,5
 Very nice fun evening. There is a reason this restaurant has been around for a long time. ,5
 Pam was excellent.  Provided great feedback and dinner options. ,5
 Great food outstanding ribs! ,5
" The waitress didn't offer to take out drink order, and after taking our meal order we waited for about 20 minutes until she came back and said they had run out of the spicy broasted chicken.  I said she should give me the plain.  She didn't tell me that it would be another 20 minutes or so. We got our entree an hour after we sat down.  I have dined at D&amp;C a number of times before, but not again. ",3
" Great from start to finish! Perfect prime rib, perfect ribs, very attentive server and entire wait staff. New favorite place for price point and we eat out almost every night. ",5
" After a 30 minute wait with a reservation, we were finally seated. Our waitress Stephanie was very sweet and very attentive.  She said she was new and was really excited to be working for LEYE. I told her I used to work for the company and my niece works for Wildfire in Glenview, IL.  Great food, great service.  The best restaurant in Phoenix by far. ",5
 Was fine. Been there forever. ,4
" Awe haven't eaten here in years.  The atmosphere is all baseball, so it is fun to look at.  We heard we had to try the ribs, but they were tough.  If that is what they are famous for, they should be better than that.  Also the service was bad, we had to keep asking for everything. ",3
 Always a treat and experience to dine here. ,4
 The online check-in system was easy and painless service and food was great will always come back thank . ,5
" We had no problem making a reservation or changing it. We sat at our table right on time and had a nice drink at the bar before doing so. The food was excellent, had a great time and we'll be back. ",5
" I was introduced to Don and Charlies over 12 years ago on a trip thru Phoenix. This whole place is filled with sports bar memorabilia from legends of sports and celebrities. It is a true sports fans dream. You could wander for hours to see it all. We got in before the dinner rush which was the perfect time to see most of it. Then the Chicago style Steakhouse food choices were PERFECTLY PREPARED. From the old fashions in the bar, to the steaks and wine in the dining room. They have a great variety on their menu and old school fine dining service. The staff was very friendly and informative, not stuffy at all. It is definately an icon that should not be missed while in Scottsdale Arizona. It is now a tradition for us every time we are near! ",5
 Ribs were great as well as everything else! Definitely worth the ride. ,4
 Food every bit as good and as expensive as Carson's Ribs in Chicago. ,5
" Consistently one of the best in Scottsdale. Great service, ambience , value and quality of food. ",5
 The sports memorabilia is what Don and Charlie's is known for. Their collection is extensive.  We had two of the signature dishes and the food was so bland it could be served in a nursing home. We were packed in like sardines. The server was excellent however and very attentive. I asked some locals about the restaurant after eating there and they said the same thing ,2
" Sports memorabilia and the BBQ ribs were fantastic. Crowded and noisy, buy fun ",5
 A must every visit to Phoenix   Great memorabilia and atmosphere.  Best bbq around.  Awesome steaks as well.  The rib appetizer is the bomb as is the creamy slaw Reasonably priced.  Do yourself a favor and go ,5
 Great food. Great service. Always consistent! ,5
" Everything was great, food and service! Serving perfection since 1981! ",5
" Our dining group have enjoyed cuisine at most of the finest (&amp; most expensive) restaurants in the Phoenix area. Don &amp; Charlie's is, without a doubt, as good as any food  at any other upscale restaurant. The difference is a reasonably priced menu, without pretentiousness. The servers are a joy to interact with.  ENJOY!!! ",5
" It was very busy the night we were there so service was slow and server was not very attentive.  But food was, as always, great. ",3
 Food was great as always. Love this place! See something new every time! ,5
" This is an ""old style"" restaurant: dark wood, green lampshades, crowded tables and noisy, serving ""real"" American food.   The restaurant has a LOT of baseball memorabilia, which was interesting to peek at  during the long wait for our table (even with a confirmed Open Table reservation!).   Basic food seemed to be the best choice, so we went with steaks, cole slaw and baked potato. We weren't disappointed! Steaks were excellent. Side dishes were undistinguished but good.  While there was a long wait to get started, once we were served, wait staff were friendly and food was timely.  If you are a sports fan, we learned many baseball players / staff regularly visit the restaurant during spring training. ",3
" Very nice.  We went to dinner here on a Wednesday night.  We arrived about 15 minutes early for our 7pm reservation.  The casual Sushi bar area had lots of customers enjoying their happy hour specials.  We were seated in the dining room which was empty, nicely decorated and very quiet.  Service was excellent.  We had edamame and seaweed salad as an appetizer, both very good.  For dinner we tried the Chirashi and the Sushi dinner.  Both were excellent, the Chirashi especially.  Rice was very good.  All the fish were delicious, fresh, lots of variety and adequately sized.  We also had dessert which was good.  Overall, a very good value and we would definitely eat here again if we find ourselves in the Chandler area.  4.5 stars overall. ",5
 We had Mike as our Chef and he made some incredibly delicious sashimi - the scallops dish was to die for! ,5
 The sushi is excellent here I have been coming for years! WE love it and will continue to come visit this awesome dinner spot! ,5
 Great experience. Will be back! ,5
" Fantastic!  We lived in Asia - and this is the best Japanese food we've had in the Valley, and an incredible value! ",5
 Amazing!! Great food and service! ,5
 It was very good ,4
" Love this tiny sushi restaurant!! Happy hour from 5-7 is a smoking deal!! Great selection and have never had a bad roll. The two of us were “starving “ and had 5! Rolls including the Shimagamo roll( just a hint of lemon), the Las Vegas roll, Big and Spicy and my favorite caterpillar roll. With two large Asahi and tip total was just over 70$. We eat here when in town and if lived in town would be there atleast weekly. ",5
 Awesome as always ,5
" I have been going to Shimogamo for years. Consistently great service, food and atmosphere all the time. They do get booked up because of this so plan ahead. ",5
 Delicious food and good service. This is a small place that you would never know about unless a friend had tipped you off. Really delicious and definitely worth the drive. ,5
" Love this place, excellent sushi, great value. The staff is excellent. Have to visit for a meal whenever in town  town. However must pre plan and make reservations as always a busy place! Last visit was a Monday and not as packed as went early but quickly seemed to fill up. Shimagamo  roll probably my favorite  with just a hint of lemon but have never had a bad roll here. Did I say love this place?! ",5
 The sushi was delicious and very fresh! ,5
" Great food!  Service is slow, but that seems to be Korean mode of operation especially on check out ",4
" We have eaten at many sushi restaurants that were good and original. If you want really great sushi in a cozy family owned restaurant, this is the spot. This was a a hidden gem in Chandler that serves authentic sushi with the best and freshest ingredients. Great happy hour bargains and a superb wait staff who can tell you anything you need to know about the menu. Specials change each night. Not to be missed! ",5
 Amazing food and a wonderful friendly and inviting atmosphere. Great mixed tempura. Cappuccino jello is a new favorite. ,5
" We got a two top table in the back that was too small, next to the biggest table that seated a large family—with screaming kids. The food was amazing, but for our little romantic celebration, it was awkward. The food was THE BEST SUSHI IN TOWN! ",4
" Always delicious food - ask for the yellowtail ""cheeks"" ! ",5
" This cozy place in a strip mall on the SW corner of Dobson and Warner is a favorite. We try to stop by atleast once when we are in town--just need to plan ahead and make reservations as it is always busy. The staff is friendly, the food is excellent and inexpensive at baseline but even a better bargain during their happy hours.  Love the Shimagamo roll, the big and spicy roll--in fact have not been disappointed with any of our choices. Worth the drive. ",5
 Stellar as always ,5
" Food was delicious, service was great! Sushi and sake is always a great night out. ",5
 Our second dinner here this week. Never disappoints!! Had our favorite rolls and tried a spicy one with smoked jalapeños ( unfortunately don't recall the name of the roll)... amazing! Will be back soon..planning for next visit already. The happy hour includes a wide selection of rolls and alcohol options making early dinner even a bigger bargain. ( and more importantly the food is delicious) ,5
" This little neighborhood gem tucked away in a strip mall has rapidly become our favorite sushi place. The rolls are delicious,some unique especially the shimagamo roll with that light touch of lemon. We visit for at least one meal when in town.....provided I plan ahead. Always packed so reservations typically a good idea. ",5
 For years - This is my go to Japanese restaurant when I'm in the  east valley. The food and service is always great. I discovered a new favorite dessert on this visit. If you like coffee - try the Japanese jello coffee dessert. ,5
" It was ok, not good or great. Fried pork gyozas were very good, as was the accompanying sauce. O-Toro sashimi - smelled too fishy, sliced too thick &amp; not worth $32 price tag for 4 pieces. Rolls were ho-hum...have had better selection &amp; quality at Dozo Izakaya. Server never asked if my partner wanted a 2nd glass of wine, anything else or if we wanted desert. ",3
 Excellent service &amp; excellent sushi ,5
" Shimogamo, is  by far one of the best places for sushi n Phoenix.   My husband and I have been here a few times it's been consistently good.   He had the crazy roll and Las Vegas roll, both were really good, I had some of his crazy roll and loved it!  I would definitely order it for myself when we go back.    They also offer wonderful entrées,  I had the grilled blackened snapper it was excellent !  Shimogamo  also has chicken, pork and beef on their menu for those who do not like seafood.  They are hidden in a strip mall,  one of those hidden gems.  I look forward to our next visit! ",5
 The best quality fish I've had in AZ for sushi. ,5
 Best sushi in Chandler - maybe in all of Phoenix. We came here for a date and asked if we could do omakase. The chef was very accommodating. Will definitely be back! ,5
" Probably the most authentic Japanese food you can find here in the Valley. Top notch sushi, sashimi, seafood  and fish dishes, good tempura and salads. Haven't try the udon yet or sake. They have a wide selection of sake, server will help you pair sake with food. Portions are quite small, enough though if you're not starving.  Overall, good dining experience, good service and atmosphere.  Will definitely come back. ",4
 Reserve a table! The restaurant is quite small so don't be turned away because it is very popular. ,5
 Always a good time. Never enough belly for all the deliciousness ,5
" Shimo is simply the best authentic Japanese restaurant in the valley. The food, service and ambiance are without comparison. The sushi is ridiculously fresh and the taste is out of this world. Zach and his team behind the sushi counter deliver gourmet dishes that will knock your socks off. Don't come here for California rolls. Go to Safeway for those. Get the uni, monkfish liver or the buttery escolar. Thanks to Mr Yoshi and Mama San for another amazing meal. ",5
 Great food. Worth the visit. SushI is great as are some of the beef options. ,5
" Shimogamo is my go to spot for sushi and there frequently - neighborhood gem, fresh fish, great service and best sushi I've found. ",5
 AMAZING!!!!!!!! ,5
" Great service, great food. Our favorite place to enjoy Sushi. ",5
" Have been enjoying Shimogamo for years, continue to go every chance we can ",5
 Place is incredible ,5
" We introduced friends to our favorite Japanese restaurant, and they were impressed.  Everything was perfect on this visit.  We ordered salads and some appetizers and asked for them to be served before our other orders.  We were given a lovely table and had a nice time catching up with our friends---never once did we feel rushed---and we spent two hours dining.  Our server was very attentive, checking in regularly to refill drink orders, etc.  We ordered a variety of dishes on this visit and all were delicious.  My friend introduced me to ""agetashi tofu.""  I've never been a big fan of tofu, but I will be ordering that again.  So much flavor and a creamy texture. Yum!  If you haven't tried Shimogamo yet, you should.  There may be days when they're busy and things are off just a little, but I'll always go back. ",5
" Ehhh.For all its acclaim I was quite frankly underwhelmed by Mora.  The pork and veal meatballs  app were luke warm and dry. Dinner was good ,not great and as noted by others, small portions for the price.  including the signature Pasta Pomodoro is a very small portion. Probably better as a shared plate.  Also tried the Orata (Branzino);nice flavor. Very good bar service and creative craft cocktails .Service was a bit slow but competent and our waiter had good knowledge of their ample wine list. ",3
 it has been a pleasant and tasteful experience. Food &amp; service were great ,5
" Enjoyed the Chef's choice Prix Fixe meal, with wine selections.  Had a really good selection of  courses, all the wine pairings were very good. ",4
" Great ambience, excellent service.   Food was ""hit and miss"".  Some of it was very ordinary and over priced for the quality.  For example, Misto Fritto, heavily breaded and over fried calamari with a few shrimp. A common dish served everywhere, but the quality of this one was at best average.  The shell fish main course was excellent though. So was the steak my colleague ordered. Good wine list with a variety of selections. ",3
" It was really good, but the street noise was noticeable.  The food was interesting and delicious. The service was outstanding. ",4
" After being served dinner the waitstaff was nowhere to be found when finished and we wanted to order dessert.  Other than service, the experience was great. ",4
 Amazing on all levels. Cannot wait to return. ,5
 Worth the 35 min drive from ahwatukee . Loved the ambience . Service was great. Food was all great except Burrata portion was very small for the cost. ,5
" Let me start off by saying that Mora Italian makes the best pasta outside of Italy.  Absolutely wonderful every time.  And the crudo was out of this world!  Wine list is extensive with lots of options at all price levels.  My only negative comment would be the service level.  We waited quite a while and no one came over to our table to serve us.   It happens.  Since there was only 2 of us, we moved up to the bar and ate there.  Management apologized and were very gracious.  Overall, our meal was outstanding.  We will certainly be back. ",5
" My 2nd visit to Mora. There might not be a third. We waited almost 25 minutes for a drink at our table, just one cocktail was ordered and some shared San Pelligrino for 4 people.  Food was subpar too. Octopus dish consisted of maybe 2 oz of cooked octopus. What was there  was dry and burnt. Meat cheese board was average and over priced. My pasta with porcini and sausage was OK but under seasoned. Would it kill them to put some herbs in it???? Service was lousy. I really doubt I’ll be back. It was busy but not overly crazy. Nothing like our first experience. ",2
 Dining at Mora was a delight and a great way for this first generation Italian to celebrate her birthday! ,5
 The porterhouse steak was amazing! The spaghetti pomodoro was delicious and the homemade bursts was so fresh ,5
 We had a wonderful time.  Great food great wine. ,5
 Lots of buzz in a uniquely Phoenix setting. Excellent service. Great fun! ,5
 It is loud there but lots of good energy and excellent pasta. ,5
 Great service.  Great food. ,5
" We were so excited for our evening at Mora Italian and it did not disappoint. We started early at the bar and had wonderful drinks and appetizers. The sangria is delicious. Loved the fried chickpeas and meatballs. We then moved to a table and did the tasting menu. We LOVED everything. And I’m very picky. Our waitress was amazing. Just the right amount of service and information. Her name was Jordan and she may have been the best server we’ve ever had. The value, variety and quality of the tasting menu were fantastic. We got to taste a good bit of everything. And the ability to customize our choices was much appreciated. Thanks for a wonderful night and a meal we are still thinking about. ",5
 It was a great place for a birthday celebration ,5
" I was really looking forward to eating here based on the write up of the chef but I was disappointed.  The service was good but unfortunately the food was just OK.  I ordered the pumpkin soup and it was flavorless and the ravioli was too salty.  I didn't finish either dish.  It wasn't terrible but I have no desire to return and it was expensive considering the taste.  I don't mind paying a lot for food when it's fantastic...you know, when it's so good you have to return and eat it again!  But unfortunately this was not the case. ",2
" This was our second time dining at Mora.  Both times the service has been sub-par... mostly because we felt like our servers weren't around much.  This most recent time, we did not see our server for at least 10 minutes.  We flagged down a server, ordered appetizers and drinks and we were finished with our appetizers before our server came around.  He said he was busy, which I understand can happen, but to not acknowledge us until after we've finished our appetizers seems a little absurd.  He came over, didn't tell us his name, gave us an excuse for what took so long, took our dinner orders (which like our first time, took a while to come out), and when we were finished, we once again, had to flag down another server to get our check and boxes for our food.  There are plenty of other restaurants with food just as good and much better service. ",3
 Food amazing Wait staff warm and attentive Sat by fire Perfect ambience ,5
 There were bugs in our drink and very slow service. ,3
" Food, service and décor are all wonderful.  However, the restaurant is extremely noisy making it difficult to carry on a conversation.  They should turn the music down quite a bit. ",4
" We were celebrating my Wife's Birthday.  I made reservations online with ease, but was concerned there was no space provided for comments (birthday, anniversary, etc) as I was hoping to get a nice table.  I had seen reviews stating the restaurant was ""too loud"". We arrived  5 minutes before our reservation and asked our hostess for a nice table as it was a special occasion .  She promptly seated us at (IMO) was the best table in the restaurant just inside the patio looking west as the sun set.   Service was spot on and the food was very good.  I saw a gentleman walk by a few times as if checking out quality of experience.    I am 50 an did not find the ambiance ""too loud"" but rather bustling with conversation.  I would recommend to friends. ",4
" From start to finish, Mora delivers on fantastic food, nice and knowledgeable staff and an overall fun and unique experience. The decor is creative and interesting and the menus are reused in an interesting way. I highly recommend it, the only caution I would give is next time I'll request a table away from the bar/patio. The doors were open all night and our area got cold. Next time I'll know to request a table closer to the kitchen. ",5
 Amazing food and amazing service. The staff is knowledgeable and friendly and the food is some of the best Italian I have had outside of Italy. ,4
 Kinda loud. Awesome food. Amazingly good. ,5
" Fantastic tasting menu experience. Each of the 6 courses was impeccably presented, perfectly paired with a wine selection, and served with obvious pride. We have watched the restaurant mature in its first year and couldn't be more pleased with the food, service and beverage selections. ",5
 Three course meal and all aspects were phenomenal. I highly recommend. ,5
 We were told it was a great restaurant but we had a terrible experience  The pork was burnt on the outside and tuff to chew. Pasta had was plentiful but sauce was scimpy ,3
 Delicious!  Our server was exceptional.  Ordered faccacia instead of regular bread and it was incredible.  Must try. ,5
 Really good food.  Great vibe.  Service was fantastic.  We will dine there again. ,5
" Great ambiance, service and the food was amazing! Get the meatballs! ",5
 Excellent service and food. Did feel things needed more salt/seasoning but would return! ,5
" This experience at Mora was an enjoyable one!  Our server was attentive and enthusiastic about sharing wonderfully unique choices off of the wine list.  The mushroom fettucini was OUTSTANDING...the perfect balance of flavors and pasta prepared with that perfect al dente firmness.  Completely delicious!  We were able to stay and relax a bit after dinner and have a few friends join us for drinks and birthday dessert, and the server continued to be helpful and friendly.  As always, the environment is completely stunning and relaxing.  We'll be back! :) ",4
" WOW amazing food, service ambiance, just a great place to go and be part of the neighborhood. The bread cart is worth going for alone and don't even get me started on the deserts. Every pasta dish is exquisite in its own right and unlike others the pomodore is not my number 1, but I understand why it is to them. Highly recommend Mora as a complete experience, romance at a table, activity at bar or high tops and will sure explore sitting outside in spring. ",5
" small portions for the price so you add other dishes , not cheap. chairs are not comfortable ",5
" My only complaint would be that family style pasta is a bit cumbersome for a tasting menu, but otherwise everything was amazing. Some of the best pasta I've ever eaten. ",5
" Loved the ambiance at Mora - the bar area is a nice, casual place to grab a drink with friends or a date.  The food left something to be desired for both myself and my husband. I have a large Italian family and am very familiar with Italian cuisine (northern Italian) and I just didn't feel like they did the pasta dishes justice.  They do, however, have a pretty wide range of gluten-free options which is nice to find at an Italian restaurant.  I ordered a sausage and porcini ragu dish, but it tasted more like ground beef. It didn't have the spicy, fennel flavor I was expecting from an italian sausage and left me feeling like I was eating hamburger helper.  My husband had a so-so seafood pasta dish.  We did really enjoy the polenta appetizer though.  We might try this restaurant again, to see if the other options might be better - but it's quite a distance from the house, so probably only if we're in the area for something else. ",3
 Long wait for table and we had a reservation. ,3
" The food was excellent; there is no better New England clam chowder outside of Boston, and the shaved prime-rib-and-cheddar sandwich is a favorite for a very good reason.  The service is similarly excellent.  On this occasion, one of the party was so busy that she forgot the lunch meeting, and she was one hour late.  Nonetheless, the staff could not have been more gracious despite having only one person occupy a booth.  An outstanding place to dine. ",5
" I found for the quality of meat, that this steakhouse was fairly overpriced.  I’m not sure if it’s still living off its reputation in the past - but the food was average at best.   I expected to bite into something very tender for the selection and price I paid.  I also found the steak to be on the saltier side.  The wine selection was ok, nothing great. ",2
 Always a not notch experience. Fantastic!!! ,5
" The Stockyards team provides a warm welcome, excellent service and delicious food. ",5
 The service was fantastic. My iced tea and water glasses never got below half full. That's a peave of mine. The waiter was very pleasant. The food was excellent. All four of us were happy. It was a good choice for our lunch. ,5
" Average food for the price.  Food was tasty but was not served hot. It's like they forgot to serve it for a few minutes.  If your not dressed to the standards of the hostess,  she will try to seat you in the bar.😒 ",4
 FANTASTIC!   One of the best ribeye steaks that I have ever eaten! ,5
" Great food and a great environment. I was disappointed that the bar seating was as small as it is. I arrived before my guest for a 5:30 meal and could not sit down at the bar, not enough seating. Plus, someone with a laptop, drinking pop, controlled a table for 4 while many others had to stand, leaning against a rail. I recommend you review your policies associated with such a thing. ",5
" Our waiter Bob, did an excellent job and made the evening very enjoyable. Can’t wait to go back as it’s a must see for visitors as it was the first time my father was in town and able to join us. ",5
" As usual, excellent filet and prime rib! ",4
" Outstanding steak, impeccable service and an all around delightful experience! ",5
" very good food, but very loud, service was very good ",4
 Was fantastic meal with great service ,5
 Always a treat to dine at this first class Arizona Landmark.  Service was excellent as usual and was the perfect place to take our out of town client to.  The food was perfect and the beef was the best tasting entrée I've had for a long time.  It won't be long before I have another reason to visit one of my most favorite restaurants in the valley.  Great job Stockyards team! ,5
" Our group had Filet, Ribeye and Shrimp Scampi and all were excellent. Also like that soup or salad and potato are included, not ala carte. We’ll be back! ",5
 We had an excellent dinner at The Stockyards!  Steaks were delicious and the sides were all great as well. ,5
 Fantastic meal.   Started with a relish tray and dip along with soft hot bread.   Husband ordered special Bison Ribeye with asparagus Parmesan potatoes and cheddar broccoli soup.  I ordered strip steak with Parm potatoes and cheddar soup.   Both steaks were cooked to perfection and simply fantastic.    Our server Bob was also great ,5
" Great food and service. Unfortunately it was so loud, it was really hard to even hear the people at our own table. Probably no different then any other place though really, we just don't go out often enough I suppose - and / or the places we go to are a much different setting. ",4
" Birthdays at the Stockyards Restaurant have become a tradition for me. Consistently good food, service and atmosphere make this my yearly favorite. With almost a half century of dining at the Stockyards, I see no reason to ""try"" something different when satisfaction reigns right here. ",5
 If you're looking for a top notch steak dinner in an old West historical setting the Stockyards never disappoints.  It's my favorite place to take out of town business visitors to. ,5
 I took my friend there for a birthday dinner. The prime rib was cold. The chili was terrible it was like mashed meat with no onions. The muffins that they gave us were stale.  Ambiance was decent however very loud. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. ,1
" Great ambiance for a business dinner, rich in Arizona history which is very intriguing to out of towners.  Food is good quality with great service! ",4
" As usual, the food and service were outstanding.  We had a very special evening from the minute we walked in.  Our server Alice was very attentive, and our meal was more than delicious!  Can't wait to be able to go back! ",5
" The food was very good and hot. The waiter charged too much for the drinks, it was happy hour, he changed the bill. I don't know what happened. If happy hour is 4 to 7 PM then charged the right price!!! ",4
" Our server, Alice, was so great AND INFORMATIVE.  The four of us had such a relaxing dinner and the treat of a strawberry shortcake as anniversary gift.  From the moment we walked in to leaving, everyone, including the manager, were great. ",5
" We had  a small table for 4, but the wait staff kept it clear and tended to us with little disruption to our conversation. Excellent staff. ",5
" Service was outstanding, as usual, however, the prime rib was dry and not cooked to order.  Free strawberry shortcake was nothing to brag about. ",3
 We enjoy eating in the saloon on the upper deck as it is unique and comfortable.   There is a reason this restaurant has been flourishing for 70+ years; highest quality food served by a knowledgeable and friendly waitstaff at a fair market price. Always greeted by management personnel upon entering the restaurant by the hostess station. ,5
" The service was excellent. We had the calf fries as an appetizer and they were very good. The drinks were well mixed and our steaks were done perfectly. The prime rib was perfection. We ordered two different potatoes: the Parmesan stack and the whiskey mashed sweet potatoes - both excellent. The NY Strip steak came with a delicious steak butter. Because it was a birthday in our group, we got a strawberry shortcake on the house that was also delicious, even as full as we were! The western decor and ambience was very nice, and all the patrons while we were there seemed quite happy! ",5
" A great place to visit, but sometimes the service is a bit too frequent to allow for a business meeting ",4
" My wife and I always enjoy our experience at The Stockyards. We had ribeyes, both very flavorful. The ambience is old school elegant. ",5
" This was an amazing place.  The food was only surpassed by the exquisite service!  Bob Hale was not only informative, but very attentive but not overbearing.  His suggestions were on point.  If Bob worked at a Burger King I would go just for that reason... this is no Burger King.  The food was perfect!  5 stars from top to bottom!  Thank you Bob for a fantastic evening.  I will be coming back!!! ",5
 The food was good atmosphere was good but service was slow wait staff was nice kitchen and bar made the dinner drag ,3
 Our waitstaff was amazing! He made New Year's Eve an experience to remember. ,5
 Went there to celebrate my parents 55th wedding anniversary. Had a great meal. Great service and good history. Was worth the drive from Gilbert for sure.  Reasonable prices for top end steak. All four steaks were served perfectly cooked. Not one complaint. ,5
" Superb meal! Presentation, service and quality of food was excellent. Must visit this steakhouse in a Phoenix. ",5
" Excellent service and food.  Though the restaurant is well decorated it is too dark.  Also, group next to us was loud and lacked finer dining etiquitte.  Felt something should have been said. ",5
" Ordered 3 steaks medium rare.  Son’s steak needed to be sent back to kitchen THREE TIMES.   Each time he cut it only to discover it was too rare.  Final time returned it was in 4 sections and charred on the outside. VERY, VERY disappointing.  The compensation was to cover 1 desert and 3 coffees.  This was supposed to be a celebratory dinner for his homecoming.  Steaks is what they are supposed to be best at.  They screwed this up and didn’t make good by us.  WE WONT BE BACK AND WE’LL spread the word about the POOR experience. ",3
 The owners and staff are preserving an iconic restaurant with superb food traditional for the restaurant and superb service.  A great place for lunch or dinner. ,5
" I had very high expectations for our evening!  I read countless reviews and was confident the experience would be memorable.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed on several fronts.  The food, all around, was lukewarm and seemed undercooked.  The serving plates were even cool to the touch.  Our reservation was early in the evening, and I gladly offer the benefit of the doubt; however, a top scale dining establishment such as this, with a long standing tradition in the city, should produce a better “first time” experience.  I will select other “tried and true” alternatives in the Valley for our next meal. ",3
 We had a great meal and outstanding service.  Highly recommend Shiloh as your server.  He was so attentive and made great recommendations. ,5
" Group of 4 sat outside for an early (5:30) Sunday dinner. Service was just right, and everyone loved their pasta selections and drinks! ",5
 Came here to celebrate a birthday and drink all you can drink mimosas and we had an amazing experience. The staff was polite and never let our glasses get empty! Highly recommended ,5
" I had the Veal Marsala was done to perfection. A light dredge with flour, a rich marsala with earthy mushrooms,  served over a marscapone polenta. Paired well with a Nebbiolo available by the glass.  The wife had the Calamari which is beyond compare. ",5
" Great food but slow getting the food. Our water Shiloh was very nice and accommodating, though. ",4
" The fried octopus was amazing, for my main dish i had the sea bass which was amazing. I did not care for the fancy citrus greens and  prosciutto. And the butterscotch pudding dessert was beyond amazing!!  A definite must go !! ",4
" Another incredible meal at Nico’s! Brunch, lunch, dinner, drinks you can’t go wrong! ",5
 Went to the restaurant with high hopes . Atmosphere was good with a nice table near the open front patio. Unfortunately all our dishes were so salty we couldn’t experience the various flavors one would expect. Perhaps the menu shifted to accommodate demand which if so is too bad. Except for the Tuna tartare appetizer which was nice. The wine list was great and they did have a great Barberesco by the glass. ,3
 Amazing food! Octopus and Seabass was cooked to perfection flavors were amazing. ,5
 Was not expecting such a loud atmosphere but still s great experience. Food was excellent and service was nice. Only thing I didn’t enjoy was the noise level. ,4
" This is the second time we have eaten here and we really like it! I will say that from one visit to another, I felt that the food was not consistent but was still good. I would say their appetizers and cocktails were the best parts of the experience for us. The staff was great too. Love that we can find this kind of a place in Gilbert and not have to drive to Scottsdale. ",5
 Kiana was terrific. We came back and asked to sit at her table. She is a delight and had the best recommendations. The food was excellent and we will be back. ,5
 Always a treat to dine at Nico’s. Very lucky to have this gem in Gilbert! ,5
 The food was excellent and the server was very helpful and attentive. ,5
 We have been here a number of times and each one has been amazing.  This time was NewYears Eve and my experience of other places in the past is the food being marginal at best.  We tried the Filet Mignon and it was probably the most flavorful and best cooked steak ever.  Brandon the waiter is phenominal.  He is fun and makes each experience an event.  I highly recommend. ,5
 Birthday dinner ,5
" Great vibe, food and service. Went for New Years Eve. ",4
 First time eating here and glad we chose it. Food and service were excellent. Try the octopus appetizer ,5
" Nico Heirloom Kitchen never disappoints! The wine, the menu, the service, and the ambiance is always top notch! It is our favorite place to come for a nice date! ",5
" The Simple salad made no mention of arugula on the menu but was mostly arugula. Had they ‘simply’ stuck to the ingredients listed, I would not have had to send it back to be prepared as the menu stated. It was great as advertised though! ",4
" Our waitress , kiyana, was absolutely phenomenal! The food was amazing as well ",5
" Michell was awesome. She was friendly, offered great suggestions and was responsive. We loved everything she suggested! ",5
" I love this place and have ate here often, but this time the food was just awful. Hardly any cheese on my grilled cheese sandwich and no fig jam and not told until after the fact that they were out ( I wouldn't have ordered it ) - but service and bottomless mimosa's made up for it. ",4
 So delicious.  The selection of wine by the glass was not particularly extensive. ,5
 Outstanding service. Great food. ,5
" Since I found this restaurant, close to my house, in Gilbert, I finally don't need to drive almost one hour to find some decent place to have good dinner. Very good food and drinks. Best in Gilbert. ",4
" The baked lasagna was incredible, the staff was nice, and the decor was interesting too... but it’s pretty noisy and the metal chairs leave something to be desired ",4
" Great meal and great service, completely accommodated for my wife's nut allergy, and the food was great wife said the sauce was like her Nonna's she wanted a bottle to take home. ",5
" Great food, everything is top notch here. A little pricey though. ",5
" Such a cozy and inviting dining spot.  The food was amazing.  Our waiter was wonderful.  We love servers that aren't afraid to make suggestions and honest opinions, which he did.  I enjoyed an extremely moist and flavored grilled salmon and brussels sprouts dish.  My date is a lasagna connissuer (?) and loved the lasagna.  Dessert was to die for with a addicting toffee sauce over cake.   Highly recommend. ",5
 I have visited Nico's several times for brunch/lunch and food is always outstanding...and love the Bellinis! This visit was a late lunch after attending a matinee at Hale Theatre with members of my widows' group on my recommendation and all loved the food. Waitperson was great and dealt with all of us and separate checks in goid humor. One friend was so impressed she purchased a gift card to give to her son for Christmas. ,5
" This was our fourth time dining at Nico, and I am now very comfortable in my declaration that this is the best restaurant in the East Valley.  We love everything about this place - the atmosphere, the food, the service - even the prices.  Nico truly stands out among all other East Valley restaurants, and can definitely hold it's own with some of the top restaurants in the city.  The vibe is upbeat, but relaxing and comfortable.  A fairly large bar with bar seating, and a spacious, but still intimate, dining area.  The menu has plenty of strong options, but I could not imagine skipping the grilled octopus or Nonnas meatballs.  These are both outstanding, and staples of our visits.  This time we had the lasagna al forno and the rigatoni  in pork sugo, with a side of the mascarpone creamed corn.  All three were absolutely top-notch, and at $14 for a pasta dish, you cannot beat the prices.  Even with 2 appetizers,  a few cocktails, 2 entrees, a side and a desert, our bill was only about $100.  For food of this caliber, that is incredible.  Nico is an outstanding top-shelf restaurant that you could easily eat at 2-3 times a month. ",5
" Food was good Atmosphere was wonderful Overall would have been better had our service been better.  Service was not friendly, even when we first walked in.  I think our waitress might have smiled two times.  She wa prompt and efficient but not friendly or patient. ",3
" Been coming here for a while, never had a bad experience. I wish they would bring back the Peruvian Pisco drink. Our favorite sever is Penny, her cheery attitude is great and the rest of the staff are all very good too! ",5
" This was our third visit to this restaurant. The previous times, they had half price bottles of wine if you had early dinner. They have stopped that now according to our waitress.   We ordered our favorite appetizer, the asparagus with pork belly and fried egg. It tasted good, but the presentation wasn’t the same quality as previously. This time the asparagus were limp and just piled on the plate.   We also ordered the octopus and calamari. We asked for the sauce on the side since the menu stated that the sauce had chili pepper and we are not keen on really spicy food. The octopus was very tender but even without sauce was spicy hot. The calamari was lightly battered and crispy. The sauce was very spicy and we ended up not using it.   If you like chili pepper, you’ll like the food here. ",4
 Everything was fine except for the service coming out of the kitchen.   Sat down at 6:15 and didn't get our food until 7:35 ,3
" Although a Caesar salad may not sound like something that should get you excited, at Nico it is. Probably the best that I've ever had. The shrimp scampi pasta was very. Spicy and delicious. My wife wasn't too impressed with her smoked salmon pasta. The service was good, but a little slow. Our drinks came out late and server said he'd comp them, but they showed up on the bill. Overall good experience. My wife and I love this option in a stacked downtown Gilbert. ",4
 Made my online reservations for 7:30 we got there a little early and we're promptly seated at a table. I had made a side-note online that it was my wife's birthday and would like a nice table out of the way of foot traffic and when we arrived they greeted her with a happy birthday as well both from the hostess and our waitress was very nice and pleasant. ,5
" Restaurant was OK, but way overpriced.  We felt like our food should have been half the price.  Nothing special. ",3
 Amazing cuisine. Attentive service. Handcrafted drinks (barrel aged selection). ,5
" The food here is consistently delicious! I love their sushi. They have so many interesting combinations, and they are all amazing! ",5
" Service was outstanding and the food was quite good as well. Although, the filet that was ordered was medium well rather than the medium that was ordered. ",5
 Great food &amp; great waiter! ,5
" Steaks were truly amazing.  Loved the maple bacon appetizer and the French onion soup.  Classic steakhouse, well executed. ",5
" My husband and I consider Fleming's one of the best steakhouses we've been to! We always have an amazing meal, whether it's steak or any of their other offerings. Service is awesome and we would recommend it highly. Can't wait to return! ",5
" The food was incredible: the filet was the most tender I have ever eaten. The service was excellent: the advice was spot on; the waiter was attentive, but didn't hover. ",5
" As always, great food. ",5
" We eat at various Flemingse.  We were seated in the back room.  While it was less noisy than the main room, the air conditioning was very uncomfortable.  It was apparent that since the a/c vents were partially covered, management was well aware of this issue.  Someone from management should test this out.  This should not meet the standards of Flemings.  Cudos for outstanding service. ",3
" All 4 of us greatly enjoyed our dinners. My 6 oz Filet was on special with 2 shrimp. It was very good but a bit overcooked from the Rare that I had ordered. Perhaps because of the smaller size or being a bit of a thinner end piece? We will return again!  I was not going to send my Filet back while the other three were eating their 12 ounce Filets and meals.  I did send the accompanying French Fries that I ordered as a side dish back because they were not hot. The replacement fries were fantastic, and very hot! ",5
" It was great, but it is loud. Won’t stop us from going back though. ",5
" Fleming's has been one of my favorite places.  I always say -- very pricey AND well worth it. For whatever reason, this was not a positive experience.  Because of the good history, of course I will return and give it another try.  Yet I have to express this -- had this been my first time, I would probably never return, as there are many other options to spend over $100 pp for dinner. ",2
" Kerry the server was amazing. The drinks were right on point. The fresh bread and cheese were delicious.  The the French onion soup was over the top delicious.  The wedge salad was fresh.  The dry rub ribeye with sauce was the best my husband has had in years.  The flemings potatoes, Brussels sprouts and Mac and cheese were delicious!!!!  👍👍👍👍👍 ",5
 Room was too cold! ,5
" Excelent in all aspects, enjoyd the dinner.  Only downside was excessive ambient noise, which made conversation difficult. ",4
 The food and service is always good but the open design of the eating space makes it very noisy and hard to carry on a conversation. ,4
" Prices are exorbitant. Shoestring fries were over cooked, cold and chewy. Steaks were good. ",4
" We love Flemings and this latest visit did not disappoint. Mt steak was perfectly charred on the outside, med rare on the in side and superb taste. ",5
 We had a very enjoyable evening. Jason our server was excellent. ,5
" Bone in filet was not tender, it was ordered rare and should be the most tender. I felt like a K9 tearing apart a skirt steak. Great waiter, beautiful ambiance, just not the best value for the kind of meat offered that evening. Fast service, accurately mixed drinks, nice establishment. Leery of going back as $400 bill got me a poor example of a filet, I'm not concerned about cost, but value yes. ",2
" Mark, our server, was fantastic. We were sat in a nice, large booth and had a fantastic meal! A great way to spend New Year's Eve! I'm still floored at how many people wear PJ's and jeans to a nice restaurant!?! ",5
 It was very nice and met our expectation in terms of quality of steak. But it was slightly noisier that expected because of crowds of this restaurant. Service was excellent. ,5
" I was pleasantly surprised with Fleming’s. I had heard that they had good steaks, but there is another steakhouse I go to that trumps all of them. Fleming’s  could give my other favorite a run for their money! The  12oz Filet mignon was great! I will definitely be returning to Fleming’s! And the service was great! The wait staff was very on top of things and we never waited for drink refills. Love that!! ",5
 Good food we'll prepared and great service make this a go to for a good meal ,5
" My wife and I totally enjoyed our date night with wine, great food, and excellent service. My wife ordered a Caesar salad and a small plate of Filet Mignon. I ordered their Fleming Salad and small plate New Zealand lamb chops. Both meat orders were cooked to our requests. The salads were good and our Small Plate orders were delicious. It was a delightful time together surrounded by good food and conversation. Fleming’s was an excellent choice that we would do again. ",5
" Celebrating the engagement of our son and daughter to be! Our waiter, Byron, was excellent as were all staff members. Great evening! ",4
 Our meal was perfect!  The lobster was succulent and sweet and our steak was pure perfection.  Service was outstanding.  Couldn't ask for a more fabulous evening. ,5
 Great food however they ran out of shrimp for the mixed grill ugh. ,5
 Early Christmas Dinner with family from out of town.. ,5
" The food was excellent!  Our servers were great and very attentive.  Overall staff was excellent.  But excellence comes at a price and Flemings is not cheap.  However, it was worth it if you want to splurge on a great meal for a special occasion. ",5
" Overall great as always. However, I do not recommend getting any seafood. Scallops were gritty and lobster was tough. I know it is a steak house but if you cannot get it right I say leave it alone. ",5
" Friendly staff, excellent service and delicious food. ",5
" My wife's filet was delivered COLD and way undercooked. I ordered a strip and was presented with a rib eye, fatty at that. Noise level was the highest I ever experienced in a ""better"" restaurant. Uncomfortable when you can't hear the person across the table. The wait staff were either running or walking swiftly creating a distraction, like the place is on fire or hurry up and get out of here.  The ""Manager"" had the filet removed from the bill which was the thing to do. I didn't get into I ordered a strip and got a rib eye, I wanted to get out of the place at that point. The whole experience was a disappointment.  In closing, an individual from Flemings called me the day after my miserable experience since I had responded to their solicitation to complete a survey. Of course he was apologetic and hopefully embarrassed by listening to what he probably already knows goes on in that place. He wantonly invited me back ""to make good"" assuring me the finest in service and food product. I'll have to think about it. ",1
 Lovely experience. ,4
" We had a wonderful time celebrating my wife's birthday as we were seated promptly even though we were early. Our server, Jason W., was wonderful as he was attentive throughout the evening. We even had a chance to speak to the manager about different cuts of steak and he gave us some great information that we will remember for the next time we come. Having the complementary gifts (chocolate and a coupon for next time) was a nice touch to end the evening.  We can't wait to come back!!! ",5
" Thanksgiving dinner with my family, didn't get seated until 7:40 for a 7:15 reservation. No apology and the waiter quickly told us they were out of green beans. This was a standard side for Thanksgiving dinner.  The service was good but the time between courses was long, and after we placed our order the waiter returned to tell us that they were out of mashed potatoes and they would need to make more to accommodate us.  All the rest of the food came about 30  minutes later sans potatoes and they arrived 10 minutes after that. Dinner was good, I had the tenderloin and the other 5 had traditional turkey and stuffing etc.  Upon ordering dessert, we were again told they were out of something else on the standard holiday menu, pumpkin cheesecake and they would have to substitute something else. Overall  the experience was poor and I was very disappointed in the way the meal was handled. This was a trial for our family as we normally stay home and cook ourselves. But, I suggested we try something new since our group was small this year. I can say nobody had a good feeling about the way things went and it has really soured us on going out for Thanksgiving ever again. You dropped the ball Fleming's. We would have most likely made this place our new traditional Thanksgiving spot. ",2
 Steakhouse that screws up a steak! Not going back. ,3
 Great service and great steaks. Good caesar salad also ,4
" Four of us had a wonderful Prime Rib dinner...the Sunday Special.  It was excellent as was the service.  Great Value!  Special included any salad, any side and desert for $43.00.  Can't be beat. ",5
 Staff was very professional. Met our needs way and beyond. God was cooked beautifully ,2
" Excellent spot for a milestone birthday or other special occasion. Super service, Fantastic Food, all around great time. Kennedy was our server and she was top shelf like everything else there. Busy night but you wouldn't have known that. Special surprise for the birthday girl at the end of the night. Super place for that ""certain""  night. Classic and Classy ",5
 The restaurant was very noisy so we requested to be seated in the patio area which was great!  Enjoyed our meal and the tranquility of the patio dining area. ,5
 THIS IS NOW MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT IN SCOTTSDALE!! WOW!! ,5
 An array of creative dishes using fine ingredients attractively presented makes a welcome dining experience. Menu changes will keep it fresh ,5
 We went to Virtu for my wife's birthday and we're not disappointed. The menu is very diverse and the ingredients fresh. We both had skillet meals and they were delicious. Would definitely recommend and will be returning soon. ,5
 This restaurant is another Valley gem. It belongs in the top five or six restaruants. It's quality high class food presentation belies its casualness. The grilled octopus was sensational and so was the grilled asparagus with duck egg. My wife and i split the massive 32 oz Prime rib steak. it was one of the finest steaks I have ever had and made for a great sunday lunch too! ,5
" Soon after Virtu opened, it seemed as though it was the only place that anyone was talking about. We were hosting an out-of-town guest and wanted to be sure to provide him a memorable meal and experience before returning home to Atlanta. Our night was fantastic...we enjoyed a few signature cocktails before being seated, each very different, but all very good. The menu had us oo-ing and ah-ing, so much so that it was difficult to make a decision, as everything sounded fantastic. 6 weeks later we are still talking about our meal which included: Octopus, Grilled Asparagus (starters), Scallops, Flat Iron Steak &amp; Pork Rib Chop (entrees). We can't wait to return. ",4
" very good food; creative mixture of tastes and textures. Much too noisy inside for my tastes and age but outside better; off beaten path--quiet area; would try again,lunch particularly since only had dinner; probably less noisy during week (there on a Friday). ",4
" Went upon reading local and national reviews of the restaurant. It certainly lives up to the great reviews. The scallops were perfectly prepared and delicious. The pork rib was generous and equally delicious. Enjoyed the white and dark chocolate creme brulees. We liked the intimacy of the place, although there is plenty of seating for patio dining as well. A perfect meal for our 35th anniversary. ",4
" We really enjoyed Virtu. The food was outstanding - particularly the Grilled Octopus and the Steak Tartare. We had the Tuna, the Halibut, the Scallops and the Pork Chop. All were excellent. The only criticism is that the service was quite slow. It was very cordial, but slow. The Chef spent some time with friends at the table next to ours, but ideally, should have come by our table of 6, which would have been a nice touch. We hope the restaurant makes it, as it is a great addition, but it is a little off the beaten path, so you have to know where to find it. The outside tables looked lovely and the windows of the restaurant opened to the outside. We will definitely return! ",4
 As excellent as the first. Innovative but not crazy and excellent preparation. I look forward to the changing menu. ,5
" Lighting in the restaurant is much too bright. There were lots of empty tables when we arrived, and for some reason the hostess made us wait. Which was okay. So we went to the little bar, and found out they had no Jack Daniels. Not a good start. We were seated at a nice outside table. But the restaurant is going to have to invest in heat lamps, as it started getting very chilly. The octopus appetizer is very, very good. The burrata very disappointing. Pork tenderloin entrée was okay. Pork chop was very good. All in all, the restaurant is too expensive for what we got. ",3
" What a great place tucked in the middle of old town scottsdale. Great location, to die for food and drink and friendly service. ",5
" Rarely a restaurant does everything right. Virtu does. Excellent food, appropriate services, great wine selection, well designed intimate but comfortable space, knowledgeable fellow diners... If only I could eat there everyday ",5
" Delicious food, good service, passable wine list, great craft cocktails, great outdoor seating. ",4
" We've made two visits to Virtu, the second prompted by the beyond excellent food at the first visit. The second trip did not disappoint. The first time the fish special was delectable and the flatiron steak at visit 2 was perfect. All was served with wonderful starters (don't miss the octopus) and the desserts are special. The meals were served by a most competent, courteous and friendly staff. On the negative side the noise level was unacceptable. Though the noise was still annoying, an outside table saved our evening. Inside would have been impossible. Still, Virtu is a must for Scottsdale visitors and residents alike. It's a little hard to find and we'll worth the effort. ",4
" We ate here a couple of weeks ago and had a really lovely meal. This time we were disappointed. The starters were tasty but the mains were disappointing. However, I would still recommend the restaurant as it may well have been our food choices. I feel I must remark on the service though. It was poor. There were plenty of staff but yet so inefficient. Firstly we were ignored on arrival whilst 2 members of staff were chatting to another diner. Then when we ordered pre dinner drinks, we had to wait about 10 mins before they arrived, by which time our starters arrived. We therefore then requested our wine, which arrived during our main course! The staff were pleasant enough, but overall a silly drink system. ",3
 It is a nice restaurant in old town Scottsdale. The food was good but not outstanding. It was char grilled. But the service was good and so was the ambiance. All in all it was an enjoyable experience. ,3
 The cuisine at Virtu is magnificent. Our party tried four different lunch entrees plus a salad and a shared dessert. EVERYTHING was a masterpiece! ,5
" Vibe, Svc and food rock,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ",5
" 4 of us went for dinner and had an absolutely wonderful meal. Food was creative and every dish significantly exceeded expectations. Service was great, the server very accommodating and knowledgeable. A small room, very pleasant, we will definitely go back and recommend it to others. You won't be unhappy. The pork chop is awesome, and unlike anything you've had by that name before! Grilled octopus was great. Wine list was varied and sensible. You owe it to yourself to go. ",5
 Presentation was beautiful. Unfortunately the pretty plates did not make up for my overcooked and bland entree of squid ink pasta with grilled octopus. The waiter asked no questions as he removed the barely touched plate - and promptly presented the bill. ,3
" Our nomination for one of the 5 best restaurants in the US!!! Outstanding food, presentation, and knowledgeable wait staff that is particularly friendly. Plus great cocktails. Truly an exceptional find. ",5
" My friend and I tried this restaurant during restaurant week and were extremely impressed. However the two subsequent times I've dined here have been even better. The octopus appetizer and scallops are two stand-outs. I loved the beet and butternut squash salad as well.  The patio is lovely and quiet and the service is usually excellent although this time we had a different server who was barely courteous and not willing to go the extra mile. Despite this one glitch, we will definitely be back again... and again. ",5
" Chef puts his heart and soul into menu; paying attention to truly honest, seasonal ingredients. ",4
" We love this restaurant ! The food is fabulous ! Everything is creative, amazing and fresh ! The setting is enjoyable and unique ! We loved our meal and our experience at Virtu ! Please try it ! You will love it ! ",5
 This is an amazing restaurant with a changing menu. They are passionate and deliver. ,5
 Virtu never dissapoints. Been here several times. ,5
" Dined in Virtu, what a fantastic find, great food, service and menu. Will definitely be back.Would give it 6 stars if I could ",5
" We had a fabulous time. Great on all counts. Can""t wait to take out of town guests. ",5
" Virtu was hard to find, but worth the visit. Excellent entrée choices and presentation and preparation. But on a busy Tuesday night, two waitresses couldn't keep up with customer requirements -- one hour to get an appetizer and another hour for entrees. But worth another try later when, hopefully, they will have their act together ",3
" Went with another couple for dinner. It took 40 min to be served wine after it was ordered and 2 hours for our mains to arrive and then they only delivered 3 of the 4 that were ordered and we had too wait an additional 8 min while our food got cold before the fourth entree was served. We thought it may have been an anomaly but ran into 4 other friends who, coincidentally were also there for dinner. Their experience was the same. Additionally there was nothing on the menu for vegetarians or pescatorians. None of the 8 of us will be returning, ",3
" Virtu Honest Craft is the step in the right direction, however, it has a ways to go before it reaches its plateau in culinary excellence. Serving portions are a bit on the small side, therefore, your value for your money is somewhat pricey.  The restaurant has potential, but we shall see. ",3
" Delicious food, nicely presented. Octopus appetizer world class. Waiter was great, non-pretentious and helpful. We sat outside, lovely. ",5
" Very pedestrian,  Lack of energy, abundant flies, chop overcooked but very good caramelized chokes and onions.  Octopus was good.  Does not compare to our other favorite restaurants. ",2
" Enjoyed grilled asparagus appetizer, lamb and snapper entrees, a wonderful Pine Ridge white blend, three chocolate dessert plate. Great dining experience, very attentive wait staff. ",5
" We visited Virtu Honest Craft for Restaurant week and am SO glad we did. Everything about the restaurant was perfect but probably the best was our server, George. We go out to eat a fair amount but the service George provided was the best we've ever had.  I can't wait to return and will recommend Virtu to everyone.  Thank you for a great restaurant! ",5
 Tried Virtu for restaurant week and our party of four was not disappointed. Three had the jumbo pork chop which was cooked perfectly. The chestnut Risotto a nice touch. Chocolate dessert was enough to satisfy any chocoholic! Glad we tried it. Will definitely go back to this little gem tucked away by a funky Little motel in old town Scottsdale. ,5
 Went there for restaurant week. The meat on the 'small plate' was way over cooked and tough. The flat iron steak was just ok but I wouldn't recommend it. The chocolate desert was fantastic! ,2
 This is my third time at Virtu and I have to say I'm probably not going back. Service Staff was well meaning but very low attention to detail - perhaps overworked but the restaurant really isn't that big. Kitchen did well to provide but overall execution was also less than luster. Ceviche had favor hints of old fish. The delicate duck breast drowned in costco barbecue sauce that together tasted like one very expensive hot dog. But the tender pork chop made up for some. ,1
" We're not from Phoenix, so we're unfamiliar with the dining scene. This dinner was fabulous! Amazing food combinations and great cocktail menu. Not right for a quiet date, but great for boisterous fun! ",5
 Virtu was amazing from the food to the ambiance to the service. Would highly recommend to anyone that truly enjoys great food. ,5
" Simply the best restaurant in Old Town.   There is some constrain the area right now, which somewhat detracted from the ambiance. Overall though, this restaurant is first class. ",5
" Came to PHX for a birthday dinner and found Virtu. on-line.  The excellent reviews were all spot on.  Food was excellent and creative.  The service by all staff was great, especially waiter (Ivan) - who was clever and simply took care of us.    Two in our party are vegetarian and had super options in addition to those who eat meat.  I look forwrd to my next visit. ",5
 Great staff.  Great flavor.  Not a cookie cutter restaurant. ,5
" We've been to Virtu many times over the last few years.  This time was the first that we weren't thrilled.    We started with the octopus and asparagus that were both as terrific as they have always been.  For our entrees, my husband had the pork rib and loved it.  I had the short ribs and definitely did not love it.  First, it was an unusual presentation.  The short rib was sliced like a steak and a little chewy.  It was fine but not up to what I expect from Virtu.  The ""short rib"" came with what was described as pananzella - heirloom tomatoes, cucumbers and Noble bread.  Unfortunately, it was just awful.  No heirloom tomatoes to be found, 3 slices of cucumber and a bunch of really chewy (dare I say stale) bread that was in a thick rust-colored dressing more like a gravy.  It was simply a really bad dish.  Dessert was good as always - sticky toffee and budino.    This time I rated it good but left feeling meh.  Really hoping it was just an off night... ",3
" There are three legs of dining. The food, the atmosphere and the service.  All three were 100% on. We had Ivan the waiter. He was attentive, made the best suggestions  as to my taste and went above and beyond. This restaurant is not to be missed when looking for an evening out. The scallops were cooked to perfection and my daughter had the pork chop. AMAZING. You will not be disappointed.   Will return EVERY time I visit Scottsdale. ",5
" Have been to Virtu several times. Probably our favorite Scottsdale restaurant. This time the experience was not quite as outstanding as usual due to some remodeling going on. (It was the summer season, so a pretty good time) No real fault of restaurant, but ambience was not as good as usual. Food and drinks were still very good, however. ",4
" Excellent, creative, sophisticated preparations cooked perfectly. Top ambiance. Extraordinary service from Nathan. Will become a regular go-to for fine dining. ",5
" The polpo (grilled octopus) is some of the best around.  The burrata with crusty grilled bread is also a favorite of ours.   This time I had the grilled swordfish in a thin tomato broth, which was perfectly light since we had already stuffed appertizers in our faces.    Cocktails are inventive and well balanced.  I had their ""Fortified Truth"" made with Amaro, Irish Whiskey, Lemon, Grapefruit and other tasty ingredients.  I'm not a whiskey drinker but was in the mood for something different, so I gave it a try.  I loved it so much I ended up having 3.  Virtu has become a local favorite of mine to take friends.  They're always pleased with a delicious dinner. ",5
" The food was outstanding and beautiful, but the service was extremely slow. I know that the staff was overwhelmed, but we waited for 20-30 minutes to even get a glass of wine! ",3
 The food is overpriced considering the portions. Some items were underwhelming and a few were very delicious. Outstanding cocktails! ,3
 Virtu is small and quaint. The staff was friendly and accommodating. The menu small but interesting. Nice find! ,3
" I love AZ Restaurant Week because it motivates us to venture out to a new place. Virtu Honest Craft is adorable, intimate, and downright charming. The bartender is top-notch and the drinks were excellent. I was served a perfect Aviation, and their gin is Oak aged on site. The Hemingway is also a lovely cocktail. I had the Chop and my husband had the flank steak. Our meals were both very good, and perfectly proportioned. I recommend this restaurant and wish I lived in the neighborhood so I could frequent it more often. ",4
" Had dinner for my husbands birthday. Wow.. what an amazing meal!!! Food, service and ambience was all perfect.  Must try the octopus and toffee cake! I will be dreaming of them both. My husband said the lamb was the best he has ever had. The scallops were also amazing . Can't recommend this place enough. The cocktails were delicious and innovative. Will definitely be back! And thanks to Ivan for fantastic service and recommendations. ",5
 Creative food that was delicious and well prepared.  Service was very good and person was knowledgeable about the food and wine. ,5
" This was a first rate dining experience. Appetizers, entrees, dessert, cocktails and wine - all were excellent. We also liked the ambience of the restaurant. Will definitely return. ",5
 Absolutely lovely food. Great job of combining very known ingredients in delightful ways. Good service with attentive staff. A bit on the noisy side when full. ,5
" Good place, a little pricey.  Appetizers are large... Could almost be a small meal if you're not that hungry. ",5
 Waiter and host was  awesome.   Both were knowledge.   The chocolate sticky cake rocked ,5
 We were a party of four and each of us ordered something different from the brunch menu. We all raved about our food and loved the presentation. We came all the way from the West Valley and left saying that we'd definitely come back again. ,5
 It's a very nice quiet place. Hidden from the public. Great food. ,5
" Pork felt under-done, but I trust the chef did it properly. I'm just not used to eating it medium rare. The drinks and service are always fantastic. Highly recommend this spot. ",4
" We celebrated a birthday at brunch, everyone loved their choices! Service was also perfect. We'll be back. ",5
 You have to try the pulpo appetizer. This is the best grilled octopus I have ever eaten. It melts in your mouth. ,5
 A wonderful experience. Food was excellent (smoked duck for me) and the staff couldn't have been nicer. ,5
 Overall a great little gem of a restaurant. ,5
" Love the crepe, salad and ice queens! Great way to start your day. ",4
 Date night ,5
 The food was excellent - lamb shank and scallops were our entrees. Great cocktails. We sat inside because of the extreme heat and the noise level was very high and tables close together.  Our waiter was knowledgeable but not very friendly and seemed to have a bit of an attitude.  We will return but definitely sit outside on the lovely patio when it's not so hot. ,3
 Been to Virtu and number of time. We took my father there for Father's day. It was his and my mothers first time and they loved it. Simply great food and their cocktail program is top notch. ,5
" Absolutely fantastic meal and service!  The place was jammed and my only ""complaint"" was the noise level, but the food was well worth it and the noise was the sound of everyone enjoying themselves.  We really loved it! ",5
 Great food. Get the octopus and the asparagus with the duck egg. ,5
 This made our 10th anniversary so special. Our server Taylor was fantastic!!! ,5
 Food was very good but not great.  Value was low for what was received. ,3
" This is our 3rd or 4th time choosing Virtu over any other place to celebrate. This time it was to celebrate 40 years with my wife, partner, true north, my everything. We both love Virtu. This is a small intimate place. Quiet, so you can really be in the moment with the one you love. The service is attentive and yet not intrusive. The food is creative, and presented as a piece of art on your plate. When we first get our food we take a moment and just look at it. Then those first bites cause us to hold our breath for a moment and then breath a sigh of pure ecstasy. Yea, its really like that. Every bite is pure magic. And if you like your before, during, and after drinks, the staff are very knowledgeable, and the selections of wines, and craft drinks are amazing. You should try one of their craft drinks. And if the night weather is right their patio sits more people than the inside, and yet it is a beautiful setting that allows for an intimate experience. You need to try Virtu if you have not yet. ",5
 Visited on recommendation of other Open Table reviews &amp; were not disappointed. Loverly combination of flavors and interesting menu. Lovely outside area to dine if weather permits (unfortunately it was 109 degrees when we visited so we dined inside). Burrata starter was excellent. Lamb and Pork rib were both fabulous. Very nice Tempranillo complimented food. ,5
 Food was great service was great thank you ,5
" Octopus and Lamb shank are good. More Middle Eastern than expected, but good. ",4
" We were in Scottsdale on business and asked a friend for a dinner suggestion. She mentioned Virtu so we made a reservation through Open Table. We were looking forward to a nice evening at the end of a busy week. Unfortunately, things went badly once we got there.  The outside area was inviting but there was no hostess/host to be found. A couple sitting near the entrance pointed us to the inside part of the restaurant. The hostess was nowhere to be found. We waited about 5 minutes and then she appeared. No apologies, fine, it was warm and she wanted to stay inside. She found our reservation and then in a panic told us our table needed to be checked. Eventually she seated us in the front where there was no one around. It was like being relegated to the bad kids table. Forget about the fact that the table was covered with leaves. When we asked her for another table she said ""there is no place else to seat you"" which was patently not true.  So, about the food: at best average. Grilled octopus was reasonable but nothing special. Pork chop with peaches was serviceable but lacked any wow factor. Mu buccatini was oily and had minimal flavor despite the multitude of ingredients.  Service was competent. Some might find being referred to as ""guys"" at a James Beard award winning restaurant off putting but by this point we were done. Too much hype, not enough substance. Pity because we have to come back for business and would have liked to have found something besides steakhouses and Mexican restaurants for our dinners. The only reason I am giving a 2 star instead of a 1 star was that I feel sorry for the wait staff. ",2
" As usual, the service was outstanding.  We both had excellent meals.  The noise level in the restaurant continues to be an issue for me as it detracts from the experience.  I also am very frustrated that the management is still not able to provide an up-to-date menu on their website.  What you see on-line is not even close to what you are offered when you get there. ",4
" This was for my husband's birthday. He loves Octopus and Virtu's was all that was promised. Our waitress was very professional and amiable. When we had questions about a dish, she was able to explain perfectly. A thoroughly enjoyable evening. ",5
" This restaurant was a bit of a disappointment if only because we had high expectations based on Virtu. The service was outstanding. But there were some misses that just shouldn't be. For one, we were served a Mojito that might have been someone's idea of a Mojito but it wasn't a Mojito. (If you want to riff on a cocktail, fine--but call it something else.)  For a restaurant that features house made pasta it was surprising that one of our pasta dishes contained penne that was clearly over cooked and falling apart. Another one of our dishes was simply lackluster in flavor--except when it came to the ingredients which had been salted. This is a place that likes salt, as do I. But when something is way over salted it just kind of ruins what is around it.  A highlight might have been the octopus, which we didn't order but which we were told is the same as that served at Virtu, which may be one of the very best things I've eaten anywhere ever.  Look, Nico seems like a terrific place and there is every reason that it should be. It's in a great area that is alive with restaurants and people and charm. But reputation and the energy of the places next door aren't enough; if you want people to come back again and again you can't disappoint. Nico is a good  enough place to eat. You ought to give it a shot because I might be wrong or I might have had the odd disappointing experience. But I'm going to try a list of other places before I circle back. ",4
" My husband and I had dinner here on a Friday night with a couple of friends. Although the dinner menu is a bit small, the food was great. The ambience was nice and the service was good. My only complaint is that the server took some of our plates/dishes away too soon. Otherwise, it was a great dining experience and I would recommend this restaurant. ",4
 The food and service were great! Nice restaurant. Not a large seating area. ,5
 The services and the food was very good. I will take my friends and my Wife again and again. I also be there with my family for special occasion. ,4
" The food was vey good and seemed fairly priced.  The service was good except the waitress  appeared too eager move the dining along.  She asked about dessert twice before we were half done with brunch,  she was polite but I found it annoying since we were not lingering for an extended period time - we were in and out within an hour.  It was so loud that we had a hard time hearing each other talk at a table for 4. ",5
" We arrived a little early for our reservation and were pleased to find out that they had a table all blocked out for us that was ready to go for our reservation time. Sadly, I've found this is not too commonplace these days it seems. We had 2 starters and 4 different mains between us at the table and everything was spectacular. Staff was friendly and helpful. What a great new addition to downtown Gilbert. We'll definitely be back!! ",5
" Was in the mood for Italian food, and found this on open tables website.  Had a very pleasant, enjoyable time, and loved the waitress we had.  Very knowledgeable on the wine selection, and her recommendations for food were spot on.  The duck was very good, and my dining partner did not have anything bad to say about his eggplant Parmesan.  Hard to find a restaurant that does Italian marginally well, we will return to  Nico's soon! ",5
" Had a great date night! Our waitress seemed very familiar with the menu and gave great recommendations. Started with the grilled octopus, I'd recommend if you like seafood. It had a nice grill taste and was tender and slightly crispy on the outside . My husband had the filet which was very flavorful and cooked perfectly. I had the spinach parpadelle with pork. It was good and meat was very tender, but I preferred the filet. We finished with coffee and the sticky toffee cake. The cake was delicious, but rich. It went well with the coffee. Overall we had a great experience and will return in the near future. ",4
" Great new place in downtown Gilbert. Wonderful food - the octopus and the porchetta were outstanding, and the cocktails are perfect for the hip ambience. Definitely a recommendation for all my friends. ",5
" Great to have the choice of a more up-scale restaurant in Gilbert  . We had  burrata , flat iron steak and toffee pudding.  The food was great , especially the burrata and toffee pudding.  The service was friendly and attentive without being overbearing.  Definitely will return. ",5
 Didn't love clams or octopus. Spaghetti and meatballs was ok. The pasta in pink sauce was pretty good. Cocktails were great. ,3
" Not enough menu items if you are a vegetarian or vegan.  Small portions and not enough sides to go with main dishes.  Did not offer bread with meal, prices were expensive for the amount of product. ",3
" Food was amazing, very loud and hard to hear your friends and family. Serving staff interrupted  us several times and we felt very rushed and staff tried to take my plate while mid bite. We would go back because the food was delicious and hoping just poor service that night was a one time event. ",4
" Extremely happy to have a restaurant in Gilbert, with most items house made, including sausage, meats &amp; *PASTA*! :) ",4
" Food and atmosphere were great...a welcome addition to downtown Gilbert. Only downside was the service. While our server was pleasant, she was very green and seemed to know little about the cocktail and wine list. Given the wine prices (normal for a restaurant of this type, but on the high end for Gilbert), I'd expect the server to be able to answer simple questions, or at least be proactive in getting an answer. Still, this was the only complaint. We'll definitely be back. ",4
 This is a new restaurant in old town Gilbert. I has only been open three weeks and I couldn't wait to try it. In spite of only being open a short time they run like a smooth machine.  The place had every seat fill which I was glad to see.   I was thinking about getting the chard octopus all week and it was a great as I expected. And every other dish was great.   We look forward to going back soon. ,5
" Had dinner with another couple, service was very good our server was knowledgeable and offer recommendations as they reviewed the menus with us. Food was excellent, the crispy kale salad place was outstanding as was the flat iron steak ",4
" Great service, friendly staff and fantastic food!  We will definitely come back!  Welcome to the neighborhood! ",5
" Great restaurant, we had the grilled octopus, grilled asparagus and heirloom tomatoes to start, excellent!   Had Sea Bass as entree, really good.  Dessert was milk and cookies, a mike shake with home made cookies, all very good.  Servers were very attentive, managers stopped by couple of times to check in.  Only opportunity was it was warm, had the huge overhead doors open, it was 106, and AC could not keep up. ",5
" Just opened (3-4 weeks), less e xpensive version of Virtu in Scottsdale. Excellent decor and atmosphere. Nice outdoor area, but too hot to use this time of year. Food was excellent. Only problem was a few service issues. Needed third choice of wine before they had it, and one enter was forgotten or lost temporarily. Not unusual problems for new restaurant. Staff was very pleasant and eager to please however. Dessert was on house because of problems. Wine list was good, but a little expensive for this area. This will certainly become one of best restaurants in SE Valley once they get over opening problems, and I would guess a difficult reservation in winter season. ",4
" I thought the food here was outstanding.  Our waiter, Nathan, took the time to answer a lot of questions for us.  We went on a Monday and the restaurant was fairly empty butwas told that is was the first time like that.  I enjoyed it myself.  Looking forward to returning this weekend and ordering some of their well known octopus.  Most, if not everything is word fired cooked.  My wife and I had a little trouble understanding the menu (NO PIZZA) but as stated above were help by our knowledgeable waiter.  Going again.  Downtown Gilbert is a hot spot.  Going to  have to find some more parking soon. ",4
 Food was amazing but the ambience was terrible. Too loud!  The metal chairs are horrible when you are paying these prices. Staff was friendly but very inattentive and slow. ,3
 The service and food was amazing.  I highly recommend the sea bass. ,5
 The food was outstanding! We are so happy to have food of this caliber in our neck of the woods! ,5
 Wonderful service and the food was excellent.  We will certainly be back. ,5
" The restaurant was decorated beautifully.  Slightly masculine yet warm and modern; a twist of farmhouse with after hours lounge.  The menu was simple yet extremely difficult to decide on.  The prices made it easy to order several items and pass things around.  The pappardelle was incredible and made you taste the labor involved in the depth of flavors.  My kids split spaghetti and I took the rest home to inhale for lunch the next day.  Happy hour drink specials were a great deal, $6 for excellent cocktails and $4 Stellas.  We dined early and there was no wait, we'll be back! ",5
" All the food we got that had been fire grilled were awesome!  The were to die for, especially the butter beans!  They advertise that much of their comes from agritopia.  All meals were well sized, except the oysters which were a bit skimpy.  The wait staff was a bit green yet, but we were there only after a couple of weeks after opening, so we overlooked this.  They our large party, with reservations, quite well.  Menu is a bit pricey for downtown  but they are aiming at a different than some of the restaurants. ",4
" The atmosphere made us feel as if we were on vacation. Our server, Kealy was a delight and so super efficient! The sausage finger food app was amazing followed by dinner and dessert that were nothing less than delicious with full flavor and cooked to perfection .  The wine list is carefully handpicked it seems and we tried to different wines that were new to us that were amazing and paired perfectly with our meals. Definitely a fine touch and attention to detail coupled with remarkable talent. We have already booked another reservation for Fathers Day. Gilbert definitely needed a kick in finer dining and Heirloom is just that within a casual but upscale environment and light, fun atmosphere! We are racing new fans and can't wait to go again! ",5
" Nico's Heirloom Kitchen is a great spot for E Valley Foodies. Definitely a step above the other restaurants in Gilbert's fast growing Heritage area and as you might imagine a step up the price list as well. We sat down and reviewed the menu and found a few things which seemed interesting. Our server took us through the selections and suggested a couple of items (the grilled asparagus with bacon candy, duck egg &amp; foie gras hollandaise sauce and the burrata) which turned out to be fantastic. We both agreed the burrata was the best we had either tried anywhere. We then split a serving of the porchetta with butter beans, salsa verde, rucola and charred lemon. This dish is rich but the acidity of the charred lemon was an excellent counter to the richness of the porchetta. A definite winner. After that I tried the Virtù Octopus which is named after the chef's more well known restaurant in Scottsdale. The cephalopod was cooked in the wood burning oven and was charred perfectly. Not at all chewy and very tasty. Loved it. The wine list while not long is interesting and has a good selection of boutique wines from both new and old world locations. Unfortunately we did not have the capacity to try the desserts on this trip, but will make the effort on the next trip. ",5
" We brought my MIL here for our first visit on Saturday. This is a nice upscale addition to Gilbert Road's restaurant area! We took our time with our meal and all of it was delicious - from the bread to the octopus to the entrees. The music was a little loud for conversations, but not so bad that it was an annoyance. I do feel like they went a little overboard on the size of the furniture and the middle support area in the restaurant as it's hard to get around tables that are full. Because we took our time (we were there over 2 hours), I felt the chair I was in was a little uncomfortable at the end, but only after being in it for over an hour and a half did I feel that way. We will definitely be back! ",5
" My wife and I called in and had a reservation made about a week before our anniversary. We are celebrating 8 years of marriage and with a little baby at home, this was a very rare opportunity to get out and have a nice dinner together (just the two of us). While setting up this reservation we were asked if this was for a ""special occasion"" and we informed them yes it was. We had 4 very nice dishes, the Octopus, Asparagus, Duck, and Fish. The drinks were well mixed and fairly unique. No issues here (I would expect not given a $140 tab). The real failure here was that nobody noted our anniversary. Why ask if nothing is to be acknowledged? When we went to POMO next door for my mothers birthday they at least gave us a cupcake with a candle. I feel that this extra touch is special, and the lack there of warrants a less than stellar review. ",3
 Nikos is a wonderful addition to Gilbert Restaurant Row.  The food is definitely for a sophisticated palate.  Very fresh  and tasty.  A standout menue with unusual offerings. ,4
 we were blown away that they they treated us to dessert for our anniversary!  Would highly recommend to friends and would love to go back again ,5
" My husband and I don't normally go to new restaurants until they've been opened a few months, as there are usually a lot of kinks to be worked out; however, Gilbert is pretty much a vast wasteland of fine dining, so we decided to check out Nico after their first week. Although the staff was very ""green"" (when we asked if they had a sommelier, the wait staff looked at us like we were from another planet) they were quite attentive and seemed eager to please. I do think they'd benefit from continued training...for example, the waiter asked us if we'd like to see the dessert menu before we'd even gotten our entre. In addition, when I asked if the bartender had any suggestions for a vodka cocktail, the waiter came back and said they hadn't developed any yet. Wrong answer as we were prepared to shell out $12 for a cocktail. Overall, the food was very good, the ambience was nice, and we plan to go back and try other menu items. ",4
 For just a moment we felt like we were in Italy as we tried each course. We started with an appetizer of warmed Marcona almonds and chickpeas. They went well with our drinks. Great cocktails and wine selection. Our next course which was the octopus dish was beyond words. The first bite made me feel like I was dining out on the patio at a tiny establishment in Rome. Our main courses were the pappardelle and pork dish and the dish with butter beans. (I wish the menu was online so that I could give them their proper names.) Desert was the fresh peaches dish which was light and flavorful. Service was just right. We had one of the most enjoyable dining experiences and will be regulars at this establishment!!! (Review also shared on TripAdvisor.) ,5
 Dined three times since the opening. Our favorites include the Octopus and Burratta starters.  The pork rib chop is excellent as are the pastas!  So happy to have a chef operated restaurant in Gilbert. I highly recommend Nico's! ,4
 Two out of five meals were not prepared properly and it took a long time to correct. Everyone was done eating by the time the meals were redone. They were more concerned about bigger parties. Not a place I’d go again. Very disappointing way to end a business meeting. ,2
" My spouse and I enjoyed a meal on a Sunday evening at this restaurant.  We were seated at a small table by the large windows.  It was after sunset and the views of the city to the north were very pleasant. We enjoyed our meals, artfully presented and tasteful.  Our waiter was pleasant and very accommodating to our preferences, as well as knowledgeable on the wines that were offered.  We recommend this restaurant for its unique views, style and cuisine. ",5
" Been here several times over the last few years. Great location and usually above average food. We both had the filet this time, which was seasoned with too much salt. We did not comment to our server as we have learned that sending meals back really ruins our evening.  The meat cuts were not the quality expected. We get better cuts at Whole Foods.  We will likely not return for the value. ",4
" Food was marginal, halibut was undercooked  the view was great, the architecture of the space is cool ",2
" Overall I was very unsatisfied; although the views are spectacular , the portion sizes were extremely small and the food quality was poor. On a 6 person  table, no order was cooked to the desired temp. Soup was salty,  ect...$500.00 and I had to make a snack at home because I was still hungry....would not go back. ",2
" Beautiful view,but the $44 ribeye was tough, appetizer cold, patio heater didn’t work.  Not a good value. ",2
" Top of the Rock is a real treat in Phoenix. It has absolutely stunning views and is a sanctuary in the desert in the city! Just entering the grounds makes you take a deep breath and appreciate the true beauty of the Southwest. The food was fantastic, too!!! It is definitely a perfect spot for a special occasion! ",4
" Server was great, wish I could remember her name. Nysa?? ",5
" BEAUTIFUL VIEWS OVERLOOKING THE VALLEY AND DELICIOUS MENU SELECTION. WE HAD THE LOBSTER RAVIOLI, THE HALIBUT, THE CHICKEN AND THE DUCK AND ALL WERE PERFECTLY PREPARED AND PRESENTED. OUR SERVER WAS ACCOMMODATING AND FRIENDLY.  THE PRICES ARE A BIT STEEP - AND WHEN WE ASKED FOR A DECENT ""POUR"" ON A SECOND SCOTCH, WE GOT UPCHARGED. GIVEN WHAT WE WERE PAYING FOR THE REST OF THE MEAL, THAT SHOULD HAVE JUST BEEN GIVEN FOR FREE. ",3
 Celebrated wife's birthday here.  The view is spectacular but that is about it.  Food was not worth the price. I got the rib eye and wife got the filet mignon. Have had better steaks at a much cheaper spot. ,3
" Made a reservation through OpenTable &amp; our table was next to the window, best view! Excellent &amp; unique food! Very quick service. The thought of ""when will the food arrive?"" never crossed our minds. We were very pleased with the flow of how our food arrived. The chicken donuts were amazing &amp; perfect spicy kick, highly recommend this appetizer! Plus, the bread basket after our appetizer &amp; before our main course was an excellent touch! My boyfriend &amp; I were celebrating our 7th Anniversary, &amp; our waiter paid for our dessert as a gift/treat to us. All around great experience. ",5
" For a restaurant that is supposed to be very good, it was, at best, mediocre. Don’t get me wrong, the service was very good and the food was good, I just expect something better for a restaurant of this caliber and these prices. ",3
" Because of my specific dietary needs, I checked the menu beforehand and made sure there were options available for me.  Unfortunately, the menu changed within the two weeks I checked &amp; the two options I had were no longer available. The menu states that there are no substitutions. The waiter boasted that the chef was creative &amp; that’s why the menu changes. However, the chef wasn’t able to accommodate me. For an extremely pricey restaurant, with a creative chef, I would expect I would have options. We left after a drink and salad, disappointed, as we came for my 40th birthday dinner. ",2
" Great view of the valley and that part was awesome. The service was good, but the food was not good at all. They sell a piece of Halibut for $40 and it was very dry and tasted old. The Chef should be embarrassed to plate such garbage! At the end of the day, Top of The Rock is just a hotel restaurant. Don't waste your time for dinner! ",2
" Was not the right place for ladies night, oops! My younger sister was in town for a special occasion with her friends. ",5
" Greeted nicely, offered Happy Anniversary!  Food good.  Views awesome ",4
" Food was just OK. Slow night but very slow service. Dessert took 45 minutes and was wrong when it came out. Valet service was MIA. I had to fetch my keys from valet desk myself and get car, as well as a few other people. ",1
 The service was very poor. The restaurant was not very busy and they completely forgot to give us an entree. When we reminded the server who never checked on us after dinner was served. They gave us an appetizer while we waited for the entree but by the time we got the missing entree everyone was finished with their dinner. The server was very casual about the mistake and blamed the kitchen. The food was excellent but the error truly ruined our dinner. ,3
" The food and service were fantastic. We sat outside looking over Phoenix on a beautiful night. Very attentive wait staff, great wine and dinner was excellent. I would recommend this for a great place to dine. ",5
" Wow what a view! I couldn't have picked a better date spot on our first night in Phoenix. My fiance and I enjoyed a charcuterie plate and cocktails during happy hour. We loved the food, drinks and dramatic views so much that we stayed for dinner! If you're looking for stunning views and great cocktails in a romantic setting, look no further. ",5
 The service was excellent.  Our server made recommendations and was attentive.  The atmosphere is among the best in the city ,5
 Very good food and service. Dined in the evening and the view of the city was enjoyable. ,4
" Excellent food. Everything we tried was top notch and well presented. It is Ala-carte and the prices are high, but worth it for a special occasion. ",4
" The view was wonderful!!   The staff was above outstanding!! We enjoyed the food, we hope next year you will have a different menu for variety.. for New Year’s Eve..   Will plan to bring our friends to enjoy the wonderful service and that view... ",5
" Overrated and overpriced place.   NY eve limited/fixed menu - 3 pre-selected dishes.  Asked for well done meat, was told only medium rare is available.  Ordered bottle of sparkling wine from Italy (1 of only 3 sparkling wines in total in the menu), again it was not available in normal size (750ml), was offered couple of tiny ones (120ml) as substitution, twice the price per glass.  Decided to order another one local then (from California). It looked very cheap with screw-on cap. Servant spilled it when tried to open it. It came warm, room temperature, they didn't even bother cooling it.  Buffalo meat came over burned, with strong burnt charcoal taste. Not eatable. View of night city is OK, but nothing close to spectacular.  0 entertainment.  And all of that for the price of 300USD for the family of 3. ",2
" Went here for New Years Eve dinner.  Excellent view from the patio and heaters were provided.  Food was fresh, unique and presented well. ",5
 New Years eve ,2
" Went for New Year's Eve, could not have asked for better service.  One slight problem, one of the wygou steaks had a tremendous amount of grissle and fat.  They knocked $20.00 off the bill, would have rather had a good steak. ",3
" First, we requested outdoor dining and as it was getting chilly a heater was brought over. The heater went out and  after 15 minutes of waiting, with nobody coming over, we moved ourselves indoors. During this 15 minutes the only service we received was an introduction and waters brought to the table. Another 10 minutes indoors and we finally got menus. We ordered and got the chicken &amp; donuts. Not as good as I remembered; way too much cream cheese. Our main courses arrived after another 30 minutes. The carbonara was mildly warm with the plate burning hot. The poor server burnt her fingers (she told us) so one would have thought the food would be warm. The steak (and my father is not picky) tasted spoiled so it was sent back. He had a hard time cutting the medium rare meat and I felt horrible for bringing him to get a bad tasting dinner. The view is great but I’ll not be returning here. I’ve visited 4 times over the years and it continues to get worse. Too bad as Tempe really needs some good restaurants. ",1
 Highly recommend. Wait staff was incredible. View was amazing. Food was tremendous. Parking could be better only negative. Cannot say enough good things about this restaurant and our experience. ,5
" Price was a bit high but can’t beat the service, the food, the unlimited mimosas, and especially the view. ",5
 Just a Christmas dinner with my mom and older brother.  Great venue and food!  Thanks so much for accommodating us even though we were running 30 minutes behind. ,5
" If you want the best of the best, you find The Top Of The Rock exceeds your expectations in every which way you think. It is one of the most scenic, tastefully decorated place to spoil yourself and your special company. Your gourmet taste buds will be jumping of joy. A MUST in Phoenix. Enjoy! ",5
" Very nice Christmas brunch.  We were seated at a table by the window with beautiful views and watched the sun set.  Delicious seafood bar, prime rib with horseradish was excellent. ",3
" I was looking for a place for Christmas dinner for a party of eight.  My party included 4 adults and 4 children I needed somewhere that would appease so many culinary taste buds. Most venues had a set menu and only one price.  I appreciated the child price, even though I think my 13 year old grandson and his cousins ate like the adults. My 1 year old grandson very much enjoyed eating from any plate that passed by him.I’m generally not a fan of buffets but this worked. There was a variety of selections. The staff was very accommodating and professionally, the view was spectacular, and we definitely enjoyed the food selections. Seating was a breeze I would definitely consider the Top of the Rock restaurant in the future for a special occasion. ",4
" We were looking forward to a memorable experience for Christmas.  I was disappointed.  It was like going through any cheap restaurant buffet line and the food was no better, maybe not even as good as some.  The price was high for me and I felt we got not much for it.  The service was nonexistent and yet you charged me 18% for a tip.  The total of the service we received was a refill on water and a pickup of dirty dishes.  The views are beautiful but not worth the 175 dollar bill.  Sorry to have to say this, but we won't be back. ",3
 Our server was great....and the whole staff was warm and gracious. We have eaten at the Top of the Rock several times. The view is great but the friendly staff is greater. ,5
 Excellent food. However the restaurant had almost nothing for vegetarians. My spouse is a vegetarian. Also the people that served had no knowledge about vegetarian food. This is surprising for a 5 star hotel! ,3
 Christmas Day brunch...very nice spread and selections - nicley attentive service. An excellent experience ,5
" We enjoyed Christmas brunch at the Top of the Rock. The food was very good, service excellent and views incredible. We would certainly return!  Our favorite was the turkey even though the short ribs were a close second. ",5
 Always excellent food a d service at reasonable prices ,5
 Bob is Great! ,5
" Very memorable experience, entire staff friendly and on point serving our small group. I will definitely return for my next special occasion, Great place for date night or an anniversary. Keep up the Great work! ",5
 Our server John was the best! Food was very good.  Steak a bit pricey but included sides and not Ala  cart like most steak houses. Overall enjoyed our meal and would return when visiting Phoenix. ,5
" OK...I might be a little ""opinionated"", because this is one of my FAVORITE place to eat in Phoenix.. I have always had exceptional service, top quality food, and I think all at a very reasonable price.. I read one previous review from a customer and she stated the place looked ""dated""!! Well, DUH...this is a Historic Restaurant, fantastic restored bar, and is, in fact, where ""The Stockyards"" of Phoenix used to be located! Maybe that is why they say ""1889""!!! Fantastic staff, great food..Come and enjoy!! ",5
" Well worth the 20 minute drive to get there. Nice atmosphere, friendly feeling, guest staff. Food was hot and served on time. ",5
" Dated decor but excellent food, good service, and excellent wine list. I'd come here again. ",3
" We enjoyed our dinner date with our first visit to The Stockyards. The wine, the wedge salad, the filet and Parmesan potato stack were delicious!! ",5
" For a famous staek house, the 16oz ribeye was dry. I am able to make a better steak on the grill in my yard. A steakhouse's chef should be able to prepare a staek better than I. The food was not bad but I will not return, still looking for great steakhouses; going to a new place tomorrow! ",4
" We were expecting better quality food. My filet mignon was slightly overcooked and not particularly tender.  My wife's prime rib was slightly tough too.  Perhaps the cuts of meat served were choice, not prime.  We expect prime cuts at upscale steakhouses.  One of our dining partners asked for plain  butter for his baked potato but was given raw horse radish instead.  His first bite of the potato lathered with raw horseradish almost sent him to the emergency room.  He did not have a pleasant dining experience  I doubt we'll return since several competing steakhouses in Phoenix seem to serve a better quality steak. ",3
" My wife and I were celebrating our 45th wedding anniversary, we thoroughly enjoyed our dinner.  A little more than we normally spend out to dinner, but well worth the cost.  Great ambience, great history, outstanding service and great good.  We will return. ",5
 Excellent!! ,5
" The service, food and atmosphere were exceptional. Our waiter was friendly and efficient, all the wait staff were attentive without being intrusive. Would highly recommend for a memorable dining experience. You never know who'll be at the table beside you, we saw Curt Warner the night before he was inducted into the Hall of Fame. ",5
" We have been the the Stockyards numerous times and be always enjoyed excellent food and great service,  it not last night. We invited friends to join us, some of whom had not been there before. We had told them how much we liked the food and service, but neither came through. Our server greeted us, took drink orders,  but one in our group, who had arrived earlier and wanted to order a second glass of wine, was overlooked and we almost had to stand up to get her attention. It was a busy night, but we've been there on nights just as busy and have found that service does not decrease with the increase in number of diners. We all place dinner orders and the food was served in a timely manner. The prime rib and rib eye were not up to par (cool and the rib eye was overcooked) and the salmon Oscar was tasteless. Our server did check on us, but we did not call attention to the issues as we'd just been served and, as we ate, decided it wasn't worth going through the order again.  Drink service continued to be a bit slow. One other comment- our friends who were new to the restaurant arrived 30 minutes early (they misremembered the the reservation time) and were seated at the table. When we asked why they didn't go to the bar to wait, they said they hadn't been offered that option and, since they hadn't been to the restaurant before, didn't realize it was just down the hall. I would have thought someone coming in that early would have been offered the bar as a waiting area, especially as it is an iconic element of the Stockyard.  Overall, we were disappointed in the service and the food. We will go back sometime, but not in the near future. ",2
 We enjoyed a wonderful meal which was facilitated by the outstanding service of our waiter who made the food recommendation and remained attentive without being obtrusive. ,5
 Have not been there for over 20 years. My parents used to go theresllot for date night. Great memories so we spent our Anniversary there. Very enjoyable. ,5
 This was our first time and it was great! Would definitely go back again. ,5
 Always a great experience and a great meal. Generally try to go there before events ay Celebrity Theatre. ,5
" This was my first time to his restaurant and I was pleasantly surprised. We waited for our friends in the bar, we were early. The drinks were outstanding and the draft beer was extremely cold!  After our friends arrived we were seated and were quickly attended to by a fantastic waitress. I am sorry I do not recall her name but it was Thursday 7/28/17 and we were there at 5:30 pm. Our food was great, we all had steaks, salads and a bottle of wine and desert. The only reason this doesn't rate a 5 is the pricing. The prices for appetizers and steaks are excessively high. Although the food was great and the location reallly nice, excessively overpriced menu items take away from the overall experience. ",4
" Great atmosphere, great food.  Would recommend for anniversaries, business meals, or group setting. ",5
 Excellent service every time. ,5
" Though the noise level is a bit high, this is a great place for, especially, Prime Rib.  It had been 30 years since last there, and like 30 years ago, it did not disappoint. The difference was, the building has been modernized and upgraded to a fine dinning restaurant.  This is a special place ",4
" Great steaks, nice atmosphere, reasonable prices, friendly staff ",4
 I have been going here since I was a child with my family for everyday dining and special occasions. It is still a favorite!!! ,5
" This is a Phoenix gem. The dress, like most Phoenix places, is a mix of casual and up. Regardless, the historical significance, great wine list, excellent meats and dedicated service makes you happy you are dining. My husband and I had a great time and will def be back. Note: save room for the ancho chile brownie dessert. ",5
" I love Stockyards. The ambience is definitely one of a kind, and the bar is like a flashback to old western saloons. I love the food and service, A+! ",5
" It was my 70 th Birthday.  I had been there once before, but none of my family had been there before.  They all liked it as much as I did.  It is primarily a Steakhouse, and the steaks were great, but we had some seafood that was great too.  I recommend it especially for special occasions like mine.  We will be back. ",5
 The service was OUTSTANDING. The relish tray is a nice touch. Very disappointed in the ribeye steak. When you pay $45 for a steak I would expect a better cut of meat. The strawberry shortcake was fantastic. ,3
 Good food great ambiance but quite noisy and hard to carry on a conversation with other guests ,4
" Celebrating mom's 80th birthday!   Excellent choice!  Our steaks, prime rib, liver and onions and burgers were outstanding.  Clearly something for everyone.  Dessert was delicious.  The chocolate fudge brownie with ice cream was mouthwatering and the creme brûlée refreshing. Our server was excellent with just enough attention to us and giving us plenty of time to socialize. Everyone was so kind to my mother, congratulating her on 80 years! ",5
 Both of us had the bison meatloaf and it was amazing. Kent is an attentive but not intrusive waiter. ,5
" Little on the pricey side , but after service and quality of food it was worth the price. ",4
" We had been invited back by the owner Gary Lesko due to a few disappointments on Father's Day and so glad we returned. Service as always was stellar! Parker is so wonderful, she is warm and friendly but most importantly has great suggestions and is very attentive to the guests needs. I had the 12 oz. rib eye which was perfectly cooked medium rare and very tender along with the mashed sweet potato (has to be the best side). Parker introduced me to the house steak butter which is a combo of butter, garlic and sage and  it was wonderful not only on top of the steak but also complimented the sweet potatoes fabulously.  My husband had the 1/2 rack of ribs and they were tender fall-off the bone good and he loved his side of the cowboy beans that he raved about. Stating they were the best cowboy beans he ever had. For dessert we thought we would try something different and got the chocolate mousse. It was very thick and creamy. Of course the Stockyards has the very best biscuits and cornbread and topping it with the softened honey butter always makes this restaurant memorable. We will be back! ",5
" Bob, our waiter, was very informative and very personable.    The food was excellent. ",5
" We went to the Stockyards last night for my husband's birthday and we both thoroughly enjoyed everything about the experience. The service exceed our expectations in that we were even given. wine tasting prior to having to select a wine, which really aided in us making a selection for a bottle.    Our steaks were cooked perfection! The sides were delicious and the atmosphere lovely.  The only recommendation I would make to the hostess, is that sitting a rowdy group next to a couple looking for a romantic dinner is not advisable.  Other than that there was not an error anywhere.  We will definitely go back to this restaurant. The quality and value for the food was on point. I would also highly recommend this for anyone looking for a business dinner location to entertain out of town guests or board members.  We'll be back! ",5
 The write ups in recent magazines were more tempting than the real thing. The overall flavors of the food were average nothing over the top for the price. ,4
" While vacationing in Scottsdale we were lucky to stumble onto this wonderful restaurant!!! They start you off with delicious biscuits and corn muffins as well as a nice assortment of veggies (carrots, jicama, watermelon radishes, celery...)with dip. From there we went with soup and salad. The broccoli cheese soup was very tasty as well as the caesar salad. Main course was divine. NY strip cooked to perfection along with the yummy onion rings. I was in 7th heaven as were my husband and son. It's pricey but worth every darn penny!!! I highly recommend this restaurant without any hesitation what so ever. ",5
" A historic restaurant with the great, vintage steakhouse vibe. I liked the branding irons chandeliers the most... next to the steak! ",5
 We always love our business lunches here! ,5
" I wavered between 3 and 4 stars but due to our server John being awesome I decided on 4 stars. First their starters of celery, carrots, jicama sticks and olives with ranch dressing is a great touch. Then add to it the best biscuits and cornbread topped with soft honey butter and you are pretty much happy and full. But then you have a choice of salad or soup. Several of us opted for the salad and it seems the citrus vinaigrette was a good choice but a couple of us opted for the soup du jour  which was seafood bisque which had several pieces of fish in it and was very tasty. For the entree first all the steaks were cooked perfectly to order. The 2, 5oz filet's, were very much enjoyed but the special was bison rib eye and my husband complained of it being tough and my 12oz prime rib was also tough and in the past I have thoroughly enjoyed the prime rib  here and would have recommended it to anyone as one of the best I've ever eaten. So gone was my past reviews of 5 stars. I had the parmesan potato stack but wasn't wowed and it is their signature potato according to John nor was my father-in-law who thought the potatoes tasted like they came out of a box. We ordered 2 desserts. One strawberry shortcake which was definitely enjoyed because it was easily devoured. It had 2 slices of a sponge cake topped with fresh whipped cream and lots of strawberries. I had the citrus burnt creme which is their version of creme brulee. It was very good and very light in citrus because I really didn't taste any citrus which, for me, made it even better. The service again was wonderful, very attentive and even John's helper Jordan was very helpful and friendly. On the evening my review posted the owner Gary Lasko contacted me to resolve the issue and invited us back to join them again.  It will be our pleasure to return! ",5
" Very nice.  We went to dinner here on a Wednesday night.  We arrived about 15 minutes early for our 7pm reservation.  The casual Sushi bar area had lots of customers enjoying their happy hour specials.  We were seated in the dining room which was empty, nicely decorated and very quiet.  Service was excellent.  We had edamame and seaweed salad as an appetizer, both very good.  For dinner we tried the Chirashi and the Sushi dinner.  Both were excellent, the Chirashi especially.  Rice was very good.  All the fish were delicious, fresh, lots of variety and adequately sized.  We also had dessert which was good.  Overall, a very good value and we would definitely eat here again if we find ourselves in the Chandler area.  4.5 stars overall. ",5
 We had Mike as our Chef and he made some incredibly delicious sashimi - the scallops dish was to die for! ,5
 The sushi is excellent here I have been coming for years! WE love it and will continue to come visit this awesome dinner spot! ,5
 Great experience. Will be back! ,5
" Fantastic!  We lived in Asia - and this is the best Japanese food we've had in the Valley, and an incredible value! ",5
 Amazing!! Great food and service! ,5
 It was very good ,4
" Love this tiny sushi restaurant!! Happy hour from 5-7 is a smoking deal!! Great selection and have never had a bad roll. The two of us were “starving “ and had 5! Rolls including the Shimagamo roll( just a hint of lemon), the Las Vegas roll, Big and Spicy and my favorite caterpillar roll. With two large Asahi and tip total was just over 70$. We eat here when in town and if lived in town would be there atleast weekly. ",5
 Awesome as always ,5
" I have been going to Shimogamo for years. Consistently great service, food and atmosphere all the time. They do get booked up because of this so plan ahead. ",5
 Delicious food and good service. This is a small place that you would never know about unless a friend had tipped you off. Really delicious and definitely worth the drive. ,5
" Love this place, excellent sushi, great value. The staff is excellent. Have to visit for a meal whenever in town  town. However must pre plan and make reservations as always a busy place! Last visit was a Monday and not as packed as went early but quickly seemed to fill up. Shimagamo  roll probably my favorite  with just a hint of lemon but have never had a bad roll here. Did I say love this place?! ",5
 The sushi was delicious and very fresh! ,5
" Great food!  Service is slow, but that seems to be Korean mode of operation especially on check out ",4
" We have eaten at many sushi restaurants that were good and original. If you want really great sushi in a cozy family owned restaurant, this is the spot. This was a a hidden gem in Chandler that serves authentic sushi with the best and freshest ingredients. Great happy hour bargains and a superb wait staff who can tell you anything you need to know about the menu. Specials change each night. Not to be missed! ",5
 Amazing food and a wonderful friendly and inviting atmosphere. Great mixed tempura. Cappuccino jello is a new favorite. ,5
" We got a two top table in the back that was too small, next to the biggest table that seated a large family—with screaming kids. The food was amazing, but for our little romantic celebration, it was awkward. The food was THE BEST SUSHI IN TOWN! ",4
" Always delicious food - ask for the yellowtail ""cheeks"" ! ",5
" This cozy place in a strip mall on the SW corner of Dobson and Warner is a favorite. We try to stop by atleast once when we are in town--just need to plan ahead and make reservations as it is always busy. The staff is friendly, the food is excellent and inexpensive at baseline but even a better bargain during their happy hours.  Love the Shimagamo roll, the big and spicy roll--in fact have not been disappointed with any of our choices. Worth the drive. ",5
 Stellar as always ,5
" Food was delicious, service was great! Sushi and sake is always a great night out. ",5
 Our second dinner here this week. Never disappoints!! Had our favorite rolls and tried a spicy one with smoked jalapeños ( unfortunately don't recall the name of the roll)... amazing! Will be back soon..planning for next visit already. The happy hour includes a wide selection of rolls and alcohol options making early dinner even a bigger bargain. ( and more importantly the food is delicious) ,5
" This little neighborhood gem tucked away in a strip mall has rapidly become our favorite sushi place. The rolls are delicious,some unique especially the shimagamo roll with that light touch of lemon. We visit for at least one meal when in town.....provided I plan ahead. Always packed so reservations typically a good idea. ",5
 For years - This is my go to Japanese restaurant when I'm in the  east valley. The food and service is always great. I discovered a new favorite dessert on this visit. If you like coffee - try the Japanese jello coffee dessert. ,5
" It was ok, not good or great. Fried pork gyozas were very good, as was the accompanying sauce. O-Toro sashimi - smelled too fishy, sliced too thick &amp; not worth $32 price tag for 4 pieces. Rolls were ho-hum...have had better selection &amp; quality at Dozo Izakaya. Server never asked if my partner wanted a 2nd glass of wine, anything else or if we wanted desert. ",3
 Excellent service &amp; excellent sushi ,5
" Shimogamo, is  by far one of the best places for sushi n Phoenix.   My husband and I have been here a few times it's been consistently good.   He had the crazy roll and Las Vegas roll, both were really good, I had some of his crazy roll and loved it!  I would definitely order it for myself when we go back.    They also offer wonderful entrées,  I had the grilled blackened snapper it was excellent !  Shimogamo  also has chicken, pork and beef on their menu for those who do not like seafood.  They are hidden in a strip mall,  one of those hidden gems.  I look forward to our next visit! ",5
 The best quality fish I've had in AZ for sushi. ,5
 Best sushi in Chandler - maybe in all of Phoenix. We came here for a date and asked if we could do omakase. The chef was very accommodating. Will definitely be back! ,5
" Probably the most authentic Japanese food you can find here in the Valley. Top notch sushi, sashimi, seafood  and fish dishes, good tempura and salads. Haven't try the udon yet or sake. They have a wide selection of sake, server will help you pair sake with food. Portions are quite small, enough though if you're not starving.  Overall, good dining experience, good service and atmosphere.  Will definitely come back. ",4
 Reserve a table! The restaurant is quite small so don't be turned away because it is very popular. ,5
 Always a good time. Never enough belly for all the deliciousness ,5
" Shimo is simply the best authentic Japanese restaurant in the valley. The food, service and ambiance are without comparison. The sushi is ridiculously fresh and the taste is out of this world. Zach and his team behind the sushi counter deliver gourmet dishes that will knock your socks off. Don't come here for California rolls. Go to Safeway for those. Get the uni, monkfish liver or the buttery escolar. Thanks to Mr Yoshi and Mama San for another amazing meal. ",5
 Great food. Worth the visit. SushI is great as are some of the beef options. ,5
" Shimogamo is my go to spot for sushi and there frequently - neighborhood gem, fresh fish, great service and best sushi I've found. ",5
 AMAZING!!!!!!!! ,5
" Great service, great food. Our favorite place to enjoy Sushi. ",5
" Have been enjoying Shimogamo for years, continue to go every chance we can ",5
 Place is incredible ,5
" We introduced friends to our favorite Japanese restaurant, and they were impressed.  Everything was perfect on this visit.  We ordered salads and some appetizers and asked for them to be served before our other orders.  We were given a lovely table and had a nice time catching up with our friends---never once did we feel rushed---and we spent two hours dining.  Our server was very attentive, checking in regularly to refill drink orders, etc.  We ordered a variety of dishes on this visit and all were delicious.  My friend introduced me to ""agetashi tofu.""  I've never been a big fan of tofu, but I will be ordering that again.  So much flavor and a creamy texture. Yum!  If you haven't tried Shimogamo yet, you should.  There may be days when they're busy and things are off just a little, but I'll always go back. ",5
 Food and service were excellent and was able to have conversation without competing with music or other patrons. ,5
" I asked for a ribeye medium and they served it to me burned black chard on the outside and raw on the inside. Servers seemed to be stressed out, took a while to bring bread and butter and they actually asked if I need some which was strange. ",2
 Waitress was especially special. Very good and attentive. ,5
 Amazing as always ,5
 Awesome service &amp; food. ,5
 I was very disappointed in menu selection and thought it  was extremely over priced. I had the 12 ounce prime rib which was tough and about one forth fat.  Next time I will take my date to Charlestons.  Ron C ,3
 I love Firebirds. I’ve been there many times and I’ve never been disappointed. Portion sizes are just right- not huge. My favorite is the 7 oz filet with a Caesar salad. Service is always good. Make reservations though. ,5
" Although we were there only for dinner (delicious!), there was a hopping bar scene separate from the dining area which looked like fun. ",5
" Great dining experience!   Our server Nadeen was friendly and knowledgeable, making excellent suggestions and answering all questions. ",5
" Took over a hour and 15 minutes to get our steaks. We had small children with us and we expressed the concern to staff, they said they couldn’t do anything about it. Food came out finally, but steak was cold. Brought to attention of staff and they asked if we wanted to redo them. Declined due to worry about wait and left. ",2
" I have been to Firebirds multiple times for both lunch and dinner.  The food is always excellent and the wait staff friendly, helpful with wine and meal selections, and efficient.  I recommend it a lot to my friends/neighbors who are looking for a good restaurant. ",5
" The filet melted in my husband's mouth, I loved the prime rib, my friend loved the salmon and her husband raved about the surf and turf.  Not cheap but food was worth it! ",5
" This great restaurant really tries hard to please. Bartender made a special Mai Tai drink per our request which was delicious. Waitress was very pleasant and attentive. The place is dimly lit and perfect for a nice couples meal. Steaks are aged and very tender. My grilled lobster tail was a bit overcooked but still enjoyable. Kitchen sent out the wrong potatoes with our meals, but it was quickly corrected. Be sure to try the amazing creme brulee cheesecake. It is to die for! The restaurant manager greets each guest after their meal to inquire about the food and service.You can tell that he really cares about your dining experience.  Can't wait to return to the Phoenix area to dine here again! ",5
" Just not what my wife and I were expecting for the price. Food was good and the service was excellent, but the setting was more of a “sports bar” setting and was not cozy for the price we paid. ",2
" Our server was professional, knowledgeable of the menu as well as personable / friendly.  Our meals were outstanding / delicious.  Great atmosphere. ",5
" Very good meal. My ribeye was delicious! Great BLT salad. Our server, David, was spot on. ",4
 I was looking for a good steakhouse that didn’t have that  “chain” feeling yo it.  The Tibeye was worth the $27.99 that I paid for it I added the side salad and was surprised at how good it was.  The restaurant itself is on the boarder of looking a little dated.  The uniforms of the servers was all black with a 70s Stevie Nicks metal belt.  Not sure how that blended with the Firebird name.  Get reservations it made it easy getting in. ,5
" We are so impressed with Firebirds. We were seated immediately even though the lunch time was busy. The ambiance is great. Nikki was our waitress and she is wonderful. She made the experience perfect. We took a friend from India there and he debated about the salmon or trying beef which he never had the opportunity to try. She suggested he stick with what he loved and when she brought the food out, there was a small plate of a sample of beautifully grilled sirloin sample for him to try. He was thrilled and after trying it, was so glad he had salmon. The price is fair for the quality of food and great service. ",5
 Amazing food and very solid service. Definitely make a reservation as the wait would have been an hour and thirty minutes without one. ,5
 Amazing as always ,5
 Met friends for a nice lunch to catch up. I believe everyone enjoyed their food. ,5
" Firebirds is our go to place for special occasion meals like birthdays, anniversaries, and the like.  We have never had a bad meal at Firebirds and we will continue to spend our special days at Firebirds. ",5
" My favorite local place for a BLT salad, good prime rib and an excellent choice of side dishes.  My guest had an excellent petite filet..  There was confusion on the wine order and Firebirds resolved it.  One of my favorite local American food places.... ",5
 Service was good but food was not. Steak came out too salty and over cooked  had to send it back. Husbands side dish was cold and his steak was over cooked also. For the price would not go back again. I had to get my food to go because appetite was ruined. ,1
 Trout fish not cooked and aged ribeye steak not very satisfactory. ,4
" It was New Year’s Eve and my birthday. We sat outside  &amp; it was perfect. The server was delightful , smart, helpful, prompt, etc.  Really a perfect evening!! ",5
" It's our go to for birthday's, anniversaries, New Year's and Valentine's Day. ",5
 We were at the restaurant on New Years eve and We were very very impressed. Everything seemed to be running very smoothly. All of our food and drinks flowed with perfect timing and the food was delicious as usual. ,5
 We celebrated New Year's Eve here. It was a little loud...which was expected. But the food and service was fantastic! ,5
 The food is always good. Preparation spot on.  The food this time took longer the normal.  Service is normally very good   Today Service is only slightly above average. ,4
" I brought my husband here for his birthday, this was our 1st time visiting the restaurant. Didn't start off good, after being seated waiter came over and took our beverage order. After 15 minutes we had to flag down another waiter just to get water. She was very helpful she even asked if we would like an appetizer. Shortly after the waiter finally showed up (no apology  for the wait). He took our food order and began to walk off when I said ""can we have bread"" he said ""oh yeah"" as if he forgot. Waited 45 minutes for food to come out. I ordered chicken and baked potato and husband ordered a medium cooked steak with green beans. The waiter said his steak is why we had to wait so long. Now that would make sense if he ordered a well done steak. The food finally comes and is pretty decent except for my potato that I specifically asked for no bacon which was covered in bacon! After dinner the waiter brings the check. I had expressed to him  upon arriving it was my husband's birthday apparently he forgot. I asked do they provide complimentary desserts for birthdays as most restaurants do and he said ""yeah, sure"". If I hadn't said anything neither would he. I looked at the check and was charged the wrong price for the glass of wine I had so we had to wait while that got resolved. Overall I wouldn't say a horrible experience but not the best especially for a special night. ",4
 First time eating here. Food was excellent. Will return soon! ,5
" Food was awesome and plentiful!!  Service was excellent!  A little noisy, but that’s the price of success! Next time wifey and I will split a meal,cause like ai said,it’s a lot of food! ",5
 Some of the best food I have ever tasted ,5
 Always great service and the prime rib is best in the valley. ,5
 This was our first time to Firebirds and a friend recommended firebirds. We had a reservation and were seated right away. We ordered coffee drinks that were good. We ordered different steaks that were really good and the sides were also tasty. The ambiance is really nice and as we left I noticed the outdoor seating in front of a large fireplace. Next time I will be trying out the outside seating area. We received a really cool surprise after our meal since we were celebrating our anniversary : see below ,4
 Great food and service together with pleasant athmosphere. ,5
" This was my first time here. My wife and I were very impressed with meal selections, and service. We will most definitely be back. This has to be one of the best options in Chandler! ",5
 We really enjoyed our visit. This was our first visit and will definitely be back. ,5
 We are regulars at this place. It never disappoints. Nice atmosphere and food. ,5
 Fish over cooked and sauce not on it. Sides were cold and skimpy   Way seared stared at heat lamp on pickup station. Can’t believe how long food sat there!  Over 15 minutes for some dishes. ,2
 Our service is for sure a 5 Star experience for friends whom hasn't seen each  other for over 10 yrs. ,4
" Lovely place.  We were able to dine out on their patio in the evening. They made sure we were placed by the gas firebowl and heater.  Beautiful evening and great service.  Our server ""R.J."" was outstanding. ",5
 Wonderful spot to get a bite to eat at the biltmore.   More casual than Wright’s    Easy with kiddos and excellent service.  .    Open kitchen and super cool sunroom sitting area. ,5
" We didn't eat a lot for breakfast/brunch, but what we had was very good! Lovely mixed fruit plate (not so generic) and tasty chicken sausages, and husband enjoyed his omelette with yummy potato galette. Nice, semi-outdoor seating with prompt service. (Always a nice location for a walk-around as well!) ",5
 Great food and excellent service ,5
 I felt the price for the food we ordered was just so-so.  Not awful but certainly not good value for the price.  Our waitress started out friendly but did not come back to retrieve our plates or ask if we wanted anything else.  Not worth it! ,3
 We were a party of four... each of us thought our meal was FABULOUS  Thank you ,4
" The patio is a perfect spot for dinner or drinks. The dining room was crowded and loud - we had requested to move seats outdoors and our group was so happy we did. The patio was a lovely setting with a great ambiance. At times we felt we were forgotten by the server - but we weren't in a rush, so it all worked out. ",4
" Both my steak (ribeye) and my wife's steak (strip) were not very good.  It is advertised as prime but I can not imagine that is true.  They were cooked perfectly medium rare.  The sauce was good but the steaks themselves were chewy and tasteless.  They tasted like Select where there is not enough marbling of fat.  I'm surprised at such a price point.  The waitress was very good, wished I remembered her name. ",2
" Great food, service and ambiance.   Things that were great: hummus plate, burger,  soup of the day, salads....all great.   Not but not least end dinner with a fun offer of s’mores! ",5
 Service was slow. We waited at least 15 min to even be greeted by a server and that was after we contacted a manager. Food was really good and the patio is a great setting. Just a little surprising that it took nearly 30 min to get our first drink before dinner. ,4
 Lovely posh atmosphere. Breakfast buffet will not disappoint. Made to order omlet was scrumptious! Servers attentive! ,5
" Nice, comfortable well served with good food. Noise level was high. A good casual place for friends. ",4
" Overall outstanding place for lunch, cocktails and dinner. We have celebrated Valentines, Thanksgiving and Christmas over the past couple of years. We have always had a nice experience for these special celebrations. Some of the waitstaff remember us by name and one sent us a gift of chocolates the day after we were served by her. We recently had only had one undesirable interaction with a waiter which is probably just odds and human nature catching up with us. When we shared our concern with a manager, he gave us a $100 food credit which we appreciated very much. We will come back to dine here whenever possible. ",4
" Have been to Frank and Alberts before with a good experience, this time , for Christmas dinner, not so much.  Had to go to hostess table to get a server to come to us. Not even a greeting from a server for 10 minutes or more... buffet was marginal. For the price per person, it should have been at least close to exceptional.  Dissapointing  tonight. ",2
 Christmas Day Brunch ,5
 Couldn't sit outside because they were filming something. Sat by a window but view wasn't as good. ,5
 We decided to eat here after flying across Country and checking into the Waldorf. The restaurant was slow and got much busier then we think they had planned for. Our food came out before the kitchen got really busy and the pizza and salad were both excellent. The services was friendly and attentive early and friendly and apologetic later when the restaurant got busier. We did not see anyone that resembled a manager pitching in to help out. ,4
" the meal was mediocre at best, the wait staff nice, but slow. ",2
 RJ was an incredible server!  We learned things about the hotel/resort/and surrounding areas that we never knew even though we live in the area!  He made the night a great and memorable experience! ,5
" We, as a group of friends / former co-workers of many years, went to celebrate Christmas as we do every year.  It's always decorated so nicely for the holidays.  Food was excellent,  service was excellent, and it was beautiful, as it always is. ",5
" We had a nice lunch and our salads were really exceptionally good.  However, this restaurant does not have any ambience at all.  It is just tables and booths.  Of course, the hotel grounds and lobby are spectacular, but this restaurant does not match it. ",3
" Good food, pleasant surroundings and great service.  I would recommend this place to my friends. ",5
" The ambiance of the Waldorf Astoria is wonderful.  We chose to eat outside at Frank &amp; Alberts.  That was our mistake.  The seat cushions were dirty and dusty, and the birds were more than annoying.  It probably wouldn't have been so bad if our server had been more attentive to our table as well as the table next to us.  The gentleman dining alone had to move his finished plate away from himself, because the birds were trying to get to it.  When the server still didn't remove the plate and birds started showing up in swarms - think Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds - he got up picked up the plate himself and moved in into the covered area of the patio away from our tables.  Our server came to our table only twice and that included the time she took our order and then to give us our bill.  Neve received water refills or checked on to see if we needed anything else or if our meals were satisfactory.  Thankfully they were.  Also, the buffet is the best value if you are looking for a basic omelet/egg breakfast. ",4
 This was a great place to be. Beautiful ambiance with great food! We really enjoyed getting the whole family together in an inviting and warm space for Thanksgiving. Food was top notch and no clean up :) ,5
" Ate here for the TG holiday. I always give folks a pass on the holiday, so giving it 3 stars, not 2. Not up to Waldorf snuff. Food was ok. The tortilla soup was good, but it came out 20 minutes earlier than my husband's soup.  Did the buffet for the holiday. Food was decent but was barely warm. Our waiter came by often but never cleared any plates. He kept rushing us to the buffet, trying to get us to get our mains before we got our soup, etc.  we had our menus and two courses finished with plates still on the table. He asked it he could drop the bill when my husband ordered coffee. When he brought the coffee, he told us it was the last cup and he was brewing another and he could get us to go cups with the fresh batch. The stale cup was full of coffee grounds. We were so disappointed, we just tabbed out and left since he kept hurrying us.  Was a $230 tab for fixed price meal, wine, coffee and auto-grat.  Was disappointed because it was also our anniversary. ",2
 Three of us went there for the Thanksgiving buffet. Two had the buffet and one ala cart. Good food. Great service. ,4
 Took 3 tries to get the coffee hot. Turkey &amp; prime rib were great. Not too crazy about the Salmon. Derserts were fun. ,4
" We went of the Thanksgiving ""prix fixe"" buffet and were not disappointed. While a more casual set up, the food was still excellent as was the service ""Z"" was amazing and made us feel at home. And the desserts!!! Worth NOT having a second helping (hard to pass up the buttermilk mashed potatoes) and loading up a full-sized plate with all the sweet goodies. A great place, in a great location, on a great day. ",5
 We loved Emanuel. He was very patient with my father who has Alzheimer's and had a passion about what he does.  Not a lot employees have that focus nowadays. Make sure you harness his talent. It is very rare. ,5
 Specifically came for brunch ergo an 1045 reservation ideal. They shut down the brunch buffet at 11. Staff was awesome and as accommodating as could be upon realizing the situation. ,3
" Every month I love to sit out on the patio with friends and order my favorite salad the F&amp;A salad. Only found at this restaurant. If it gets too chilly they will turn on the fireplaces. Sit out by the fire, listen to the fountain. Great service. ",5
" Food was just okay and the service was very slow.  Waited forever for server to come back and settle our checks.  Quite noisy location, conversation difficult. ",3
" The food was great but the service wasn't. Our appetizer, salads and entree were served within one minute of each other. I was at the Biltmore but thought I was at Dennys. ",3
 We frequent this restaurant while staying at the Biltmore for vacation.  The menu has changed since we were there three years ago and is now very inventive while keeping our favorites (the meatloaf w/mashed).  Also there is the ability to downsize the portions which is highly desirable when on vacation so that there are no leftovers.I️ love the new salads and the wine list is very good.  Very friendly staff...we love staying at the Biltmore!! ,5
" The F&amp;A salad, absolutely the best ever. Service was great. Outdoor patio a must. ",5
" My wife and I went to Frank and Alberts on a special date. Though pricey, the food and ambiance were worth it. We had an excellent dinner on their outdoor patio. Our server, Troy, gave us some great recommendations. ",5
" This was a real disappointment. The food was mediocre, but as important, the food was served before we had even started drinking our cocktails. Very expensive and not good. ",2
" Outdoor seating was very enjoyable. However, staff was mediocre at best (seemed distracted and aloof) and between the cold salmon dish and dirty glasses I can't give this place more than 3 stars. And 3 because of the outdoor seating.  Not at all what I expected from a Waldorf hotel, quite disappointing. ",3
" Nico's was a great place. We met for Sunday brunch and bottomless Mimosas. They were truly bottomless! My glass was never empty! It was great. The restaurant is small so I could see how it might get crowded during busy times, but we didn't have that problem at all. The food was delicious too! I will be back - hopefully sooner than later! ",5
" Get the bass, shrimp, octopus, and clams! You won't regret it! ",5
" First time at Nico after many trips to Virtu, and we will be back.  Great bar scene and vibrant, open layout.  Our server was outstanding - personable, knowledgeable and extremely attentive.  He was a pro, and you could tell that he truly cares about the restaurant.  Cocktails before dinner were excellent.  We had the octopus,  a Virtu staple and it was as great at Nico as it is at Virtu.  We also had Nonna's meatballs, which were amazing - and a very nice portion.  For our entrees, I had the branzino, which was very good, but not overwhelming.  My wife had the rigatoni with pork sugo.  It was also very, very good, but, like the branzino, was overshadowed by the octopus and the meatballs.  Once of the things that I really like about Nico is the prices.  These are very fair prices for this caliber of food, and puts Nico into a category of frequent dining, as opposed to special occasion dining.  It definitely suitable for both.  We look forward to coming back and trying new entrees ",4
" This was our first time at Nico Heirloom Kitchen and we loved it.  The food, waiter and atmosphere was excellent.  We'll definitely be going back again soon. ",5
" The first time I tried to eat at Nico’s the electricity went out and they had to close the restaurant. The second time I made reservations I got the flu and had to cancel. When they say three is a charm they must not have had this restaurant in mind. I ordered the Pesce Olio (poached butterfish) puttanesca with charred tomatoes, olives, capers and butter bean ragu. First of all, when I think of butterfish it comes to mind a light buttery fish with mild flavor that wants to melt in your mouth. This however, was a thick meaty fish without a speck of flavor. The olives were overpowering and the bean ragu tasted like mush. None of the flavors meshed with one another and were not complimentary. My friend had the sea bass which was crispy on the outside but again, slightly overcooked to not be light and flaky on the inside. My husband had their much-touted Lasagna al forno Bolognese; which apparently beat Bobby Flay’s. However, once again…cooked too long. On a positive note my other friend had the Veal Marsala and he liked it. The service was outstanding and the location is great but there are too many fabulous restaurants in the area to ever go back here. All around it was  a big disappointment. ",1
" This has quickly become my favorite, go-to restaurant. The pork sugo is my absolute favorite menu item, almost as good as my mom's homemade sauce... ",5
 This place was one of tbe best italian restaurants I've ever eaten at. The food was outstanding. Great modern italian decor. ,5
" Restaurant was very lively on Saturday - very loud.  My party was hoarse by the end of the evening.  The waiter, Tim - was great.  The food was pricey and not very good.  The pasta was tough and the pork ragu wasn't that flavorful.  I ordered the rigatoni and was expecting a great dish according to Tim as this was his favorite.  It was disappointing.  We ordered a polenta board  and got more bread than anything.  Polenta was more a grits texture.  The white sangria was the hit of the night as we ordered two pitchers. ",3
 Nico is a very nice dining choice for downtown Gilbert. The lasagna was outstanding. ,4
" Our group of 5 was celebrating our friends birthday and decided to try somewhere new. From the time we arrived we were treated like royalty. The service was amazing, the food and drinks were great, and we stayed there for quite awhile and never felt rushed. The restaurant is nicely decorated and even the restrooms were memorable. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to have a great time with friends. ",5
 Great new restaurant with a simple and perfect menu.  The service was impeccable. ,5
 Amazing food!!! ,5
 We love going to Nicos.  It has everything that we expect for a superb restaurant.  Thank you! ,5
 Best Flank Steak I have ever eaten. Nice selection of wine and craft beers. ,5
 Wanted to try a new place in the area for a special occasion. Nico Heirloom Kitchen did not disappoint as the staff warmly welcomed us and gave us our preference for a table. The server was knowledgeable and patient with our questions. Ordered the asparagus with duck egg and loved it. Homemade pasta  (lasagna and rigatoni is what we ordered ) was excellent. The pumpkin pie with cinnamon whipped cream was the best I have ever had. Highly recommend. ,5
" Outstanding service, ambiance and, especially FOOD! Loved the in house mozzarella cheese caprese salad. Homemade pasta was delicious and the fish was wonderful with the olives and white beans. ",5
" Food was good.  Service was less than perfect, but very good.  Restaurant was very loud acoustically.   Not the best place for a ""quiet dinner"" or date. ",4
 I can't say enough! It was amazing! Absolutely delicious meal and the server was awesome! ,5
" We were all incredibly impressed by the knowledgable and friendly staff, and most certainly the quality of the food and wine.  The in-house made pasta and fresh-pulled mozzarella are a must! ",5
" The food was tasty, but I'm not sure it was worth the cost for what we got.  The one thing they did absolutely right was offer a free birthday dessert and I chose the homemade salted butterscotch pudding.  It was one of the best desserts I've ever had!! ",4
" We went to Nico on a Saturday night.  It was crowded but the service was efficient and very professional.  We have been to the owners other restaurant, Virtu, in Scottsdale which was good but this was better.    We had the grilled octopus appetizer which we have had a Virtu but this was a larger portion.  I had Lasagna and my husband had a pasta dish with pulled pork and rigatoni pasta.  Both were reasonably priced and delicious.   The restaurant has an urban vibe and energy to it.  I have already recommended to friends. ",5
 Daughter had raved about the food and drinks when she dined there soon after it opened...our group of friends tried it and loved the food.   They have some great drinks listed we didn't try but will next time...dessert was great too.  Will go back again soon.  Our serving girl was wonderful. ,5
 Came here for my birthday and I have a new favorite restaurant! We had stuffed clams and grilled octopus for appetizers-both were unique and very tasty. Dinner was Branzino and Flat Iron steak. Fish was light and flavorful; steak was rich and very good. We dined outside and I love the decor and open concept. Service was stellar (ask for Grace - she's the best!) Can't wait to return! ,5
" This was my second visit to Nico's for brunch. Both visits food outstanding, fresh modern approach to primarily casual Italian. Location in downtown Gilbert great for me as I live nearby. First visit I enjoyed the crepe which was fabulous and a huge serving. Second visit ordered the gourmet grilled cheese - also delicious. Another plus is the endless bellinis for flat fee. Only disappointment is unlike my first visit on a Saturday,  this Sunday was busy and as a result very noisy making conversation very difficult. ",5
" We've been to Nico's twice in the past couple of months, both times to celebrate birthdays.  The food is simply wonderful and the atmosphere is perfect! ",5
 While the overall experience was very good - the service was the highlight of our evening there.  We will return! ,5
" Wonderful food, service, everything! ",5
 Nice elegant rustic vibe but still casual.  One gets very comfortable in its surroundings quickly.  I've eaten at the chef's other restaurant (Virtue) so the food is good.  I was surprised though that the food was a bit salty and the sauces on my veal and on my guests chicken was smothering - couldn't taste the meat or chicken. ,4
 We have been to Nico's Heirloom Kitchen twice and absolute loved it!  The octopus is to die for as is the Pork Rib Sugo. ,5
" Great food, great service, but the ambiance took the edge off.  Noise level was close to unacceptable. There is no wall between a very loud and lively bar scene and the eating area, so dinner becomes a shouting match, even with the person directly across the table from you.  Not the kind of dining experience I care for. ",4
" This restaurant is very nice, &amp; the service &amp; ambience are top notch, but I did not personally love the menu options. The quality of food was excellent &amp; cooked perfectly.  I just did not like my options. ",4
" Second visit,  cannot wait for the3rd. And 4th. Andso on... ",5
" Great food. Octopus was fantastic.  Veal marsala great, but one of the two pieces of veal was less tender than the other.   Visit everytime I come to MEsa.   Service variable, a little slower this time. ",4
" Love  this restaurant. Food is delicious, beautifully presented, and professionally served. Will return often. ",5
" We went for AZ Restaurant Week and a birthday celebration, besides waiting just a little for our food, the tastes the Chef created were superb. Well worth the visit! ",5
" The manager met us when we arrived and was very cordial.   The calamari appetizer was mixed with a few of the calamari over cooked but the sauce was outstanding.   The tube pasta was over cooked and starchy.  One of the tube pasta dishes was short changed on sauce, but the server corrected it immediately.    The white chocolate creme brûlée was overly sweet and a bit grainy.  The profiteroles  were described as ""peanut butter and chocolate inside"".  The reality was there was excessive peanut butter inside and a hint of chocolate swirled on the plate under the profiteroles.  The place is very modern and looks great.  Great atmosphere, but the food was a letdown. ",3
" What a lovely evening.  The staff couldn't be more welcoming. The food was incredible. I enjoyed the butterfish.  My girlfriends had the short ribs, and the lasagna.  There was more than enough on the dessert plate to satisfy all 3 of us!  And I loved it enough to come back a few days later with my boyfriend.  And I was greeted with ""You're back!"" ",5
" Second time there and just as impressed! Wonderful, will be back! ",5
" My husband and I were looking forward to taking our good friend to a birthday brunch gathering at Nico. Everything on the menu looked enticing. The whole mood was dampened by our server. He was bald with eyeglasses. Unfortunately, I do not remember his name. The restaurant was not busy at 11am on Sunday, though, he acted as if he had more important things to do than to serve us. His distracted, negative mood affected the whole atmosphere of our experience. He would constantly rush past us, avoiding any possibility for us to get his attention. It is unfortunate that one person can have such a negative effect on a restaurant. The food was good, however, we won't be working our way through the menu. Sadly, I don't think we will be back. We will spread our love to the many other Gilbert eating establishments. ",2
 The food is fantastic! We have been here several times and have always had a wonderful experience ,5
" We were seated right away on the first Saturday of Restaurant Week.  Tables are nice though a wee bit small.  My husband and I ordered off of the preset Restaurant Week menu.  He had the calamari served with focaccia which was very good though I would recommend a denser,  more toasted bread for a change in texture.  I had the mushroom crepes which were lacking in cheese (and therefore quite a bit of the flavor) and served almost cold.  For our entrees hubby had the short ribs on polenta and that was excellent.  I had the pasta with Sunday sauce which again was served tepid and was very dry, even difficult to cut with a knife.  Desserts were crème Brule (excellent) and profiteroles which were almost cloyingly sweet.  In my opinion, if you have a preset menu and you know that 80% of diners are will be ordering from that, those three items should be stellar.  Sad to say that was not the case. ",3
 Fun spot - staff so friendly - great food - one of he best spots in the Valley!! ,5
 Much too noisy.  Very inconsistent food.  Much very good some poor.  Too pricy for the overall quality.  Better overall values in Scottsdale. ,3
 Our meal was wonderful.  Food was tasty - generous portions - great overall.  The desserts were fantastic!  Can't wait to come back. ,5
 We've been here several times over the past few months. This might have been our least favorite time. The food appeared to be mass produced. Things arranged in the kitchen from warming plates. The noise level was loud -making it difficult to converse with companions. Better to come here on an off-day or an off hour. It feels more personalized. ,4
 Great food.  All three dishes we had were excellent from the lasagna (delicious!) to the two fish dishes which were each really good.  Portions were a good size and a great value overall.  Drinks were very good as well.  Definitely worth returning to.  Get the quality of a meal at Virtu without the Old Town Scottsdale price. ,4
 Had a great experience and the food was great!!! I would recommend it to my friends. ,4
" Excellent menu selections (not typical red sauce Italian) and wine list.   Appetizer, pasta dish, entree's, and wine that we had were all both unique and very tasty.   Can't wait to go through the rest of the menu and try both the standard items as well as those that change. ",5
" Outstanding food, grrat service, ambiance and noise level could be better given the prices. ",4
" Food was very good,  the ambiance and décor was nice, but the metal chairs were uncomfortable and not on par with a restaurant of this price and décor. The noise level was a bit high at peak dining hour, all in all a very good dining experience though. ",4
 Outstanding food.  One of the best Italian restaurants in the Phoenix Metro Area. ,5
 Loved the summer menu. Dislike the fall menu. Food was very salty and service was not very good. ,3
 They knew it was a first date and they went above and beyond. They took care of everything and made it a very special evening. ,5
" Sadly, we would not recommend this restaurant and I am not sure we will give it another try.  We were going there for dinner to celebrate our 22nd wedding anniversary.   We have traveled to Italy numerous times and when we first read about Nico on-line, we were super excited to try it.  The menu looked like a nice combination of Italian and Western cuisine.   And the wine list was extraordinary - even some from Gaja, one of finest producers in the world.      I am a big fan of a traditional, simple Italian dish called Cacio e Pepe; it is typically made with a long, thin noodle like a spaghetti and the big feature is the Pecorino Romano cheese and fresh ground black pepper.  It is one of those dishes that is deceptively simple yet takes a while to actually master.    When I saw it on the menu, given the chefs reputation, I was very excited to try it.   What arrived, however, was a wide egg noodle (very thin &amp; delicate, but wide) swimming in butter with very little pepper (and I don't think it was fresh ground) and not much cheese.   In and of itself it really wasn't very good (extremely bland) AND, if that's what you are going to serve, DON'T call it Cacio e Pepe.    My husbands flat iron served on a bed of smashed potatoes with garlic &amp; cippolini onions was not much better.   The flat iron was not carved, it was just a chunk of the end cut and the first go 'round of potatoes tasted like fish (it had clearly been served up with a spoon that had been used in a fish dish.)   The server took the chunk of meat off the dinner table, set it on a side dish to get cold on the table while she went in search of a new serving of potatoes.    I will say that we had an excellent spinach salad and the meatball starter was excellent.   They also handled themselves very nicely and graciously comped our meals. ",2
" We went on the first night of a new menu and there were a few things that went wrong-not the least of which was no lasagna available. But, our server made the night a success for us. It was pretty pricey for not getting the entrees we wanted. But, we may give it one more shot because the location is the bomb!  Downtown Gilbert!! ",5
" Been here a few times. Some dishes have been great while others horrible. Consistency one night to the next is a big issue. By far the best dish is the smoked octopus, but it's been served to us as pure perfection and as a burnt mess. If you hit a good night, you'll enjoy most of the food but on a bad night you're throwing money away. ",2
" Great food. Small dining area, felt a little cramped. ",4
 The food and service was great. We sat inside and it was very loud. Next time I will ask for patio seating. ,4
 Had reservation and arrived on time. We were asked to wait ten minutes at bar for an open table. The host forgot about us and we were finally seated 35 minutes after our original reservation. Food was nothing spectacular and the chairs were uncomfortable. ,2
" Noise level inside the restaurant was very high. Food was good,  but I didn't notice anything special or outstanding about it. I had a  pleasant time with my friend, but  I won't say that was very impressed by food and restaurant overall. ",4
 The touchs of flavors combined create to unusual combinations. Especially enjoyed the mixed green salad and chicken scallopini. ,4
 Food was amazing- even the house salad was delicious! We sat on the patio and it was the perfect ambience for a fun date night. ,5
" busy place, food is nice. Dessert was less than subtle...take it for what it's worth. Will be returning to try the pasta ",4
" Couple of things.  First, drinks were ordered and the pour was  very disappointing and when the check came, there was a charge of $3.63 for ice.  Secondly, the octopus which is one of their specialties came out spongy and cold unlike the hot grilled we've had in the past.  Not up to the standard that was in our first visit.  Probably won't be back for a while. ",3
" Love this place. Food is excellent, service is awesome. Bartenders are familiar with our cocktails of choice. Plus, Matthew Grunwald from last season's Food Network Star is one of the chefs. He is super nice and always stops to say hi. The octopus is the dish to try, but really anything you order will exceed your expectations. Love it here and will continue to go back repeatedly! ",5
 Great food and service.  Can't wait to try out their dinner menu and to try some more of their brunch menu ,5
" It was packed on a Saturday night, as expected, and there was a mighty din. We had the grilled asparagus and Nonna's meatballs with focaccia for appetizers and loved both, especially the candied bacon in the former and the herby focaccia in the latter. For entrees, he had the pancetta- and parmesan-crusted filet and I had the spinach pappardelle with pork sugo and black pepper ricotta. Everything was delicious and perfectly portioned. We also enjoyed the tiramisu for two for dessert, but thought there were too many non-torched marshmallows chilling in the layers - just the golden top ones would have been great. Still, it was tasty. ",5
" Food was outstanding! Fun menu, with staff that really cares that you're having a good time. Great experience! ",5
" Restaurant was very noisy.  The combination of the patron's voices mixed with the music trying to overcome the patron noise made it uncomfortable.  It quieted down later on, as we were there from 8pm to 10pm.  The metal chairs are uncomfortable.   Upon sitting down, we were immediately acknowledged.  We placed a drink order and we were then ignored for over 15 minutes.  Server came by and said our drinks should be right up.  We placed an appetizer order, then the drinks arrived nearly 20 minutes after placing the order.  After that, service was timely, as well as the food arriving.  The gentleman who brought out our 3 appetizers spent a couple of moments going over each dish.  That was appreciated. We'll definitely come back, hopefully the metal chairs will get replaced. ",4
 This was our second dinner at Nicos.  The menu is small but a variety of choices from pasta to seafood to veal.  Great appetizers.  The service was very good.  Good dessert and drink choices. We have been to their other restaurant in Scottsdale but enjoy Nicos as much.  Hope they succeed.  The last two times we were there the restaurant was very busy. ,5
 What an amazing experience. Gotta try the short ribs with jalapeño grits. Ribs were so tender...just fell apart with a fork and the grits...a little kick but not too bad. Throw in the barrel aged Manhattan and I was in heaven. ,5
 Nice variety on the menu and everyone enjoyed their meal. Service was great. Sat on the patio so it was nice. ,4
 Always enjoy eating here ,4
" Trey, our server was wonderful! Highly recommend this location and the great staff! Also Black Tea is amazing.   We were greeted multiple times by staff and the chef. I really appreciated that level of customer service.   Thank you, Grassroots! ",5
 Grassroots is always delicious! One of my favorites! ,5
" Grassroots is a wonderful place to share time with the special people in your life. The location, food, and beverages are excellent. I eat out a lot, and it's always very special when it's date-night at Grassroots. ",5
" Excellent service and food - menu is varied enough to please everyone, and so far everything we've tried has been very good. Great neighborhood spots - we've been to both the Phoenix and Scottsdale restaurants multiple times, and have never been disappointed. ",5
" We had a wonderful dinner on the patio. I was afraid it might be chilly but the patio has roll-down clear shades and overhead heaters which made it the perfect temperature. The food was delicious. I had the halibut special and it was fantastic. I would have to say the highlight was our server, Mary (from Michigan). She was knowledgeable, friendly and attentive. She gave us plenty of time to chat and didn't rush us through our meal. Overall, excellent service! ",5
 Great food! Service could have been better. I waited 20 min for a glass of wine on a Tuesday night and not busy. ,4
" Good food with interesting choices on the menu. Very accommodating with substitution. Poke was great as was  ahi tuna. Gumbo was good, not great. Short ribs were delicious.  Loved the asparagus and pork belly appetizers. ",4
" We've been to Grassroots plenty of times before and we've always found the food to be exceptional - highly recommend the shrimp and grits and tuna poke! Service was so-so this time around. I think we had about 3 different waiters during our entire visit, so we weren't sure who to flag down to get a refill on our drinks. Overall - good food at fair prices, although service could be a bit better. ",3
 Grassroots has become a staple of our “go to“ restaurants in the area… The salads and sandwiches are exceptionally good and last night we tried the baby back ribs for the first time and they were beyond heavenly! This restaurant is an excellent reliable staple that always offers fresh tasty fare in a relaxed enjoyable environment! ,5
" This was our first visit to Grassroots, celebrating our 27th wedding anniversary.  I can't say enough about the bar staff, wait staff, food and drink selection.  Everyone was so attentive!  Their specialty cocktails were delicious (we had the Sazerac &amp; Sangria - yum!) and the food was prepared with thoughtfulness and care.  Even thought it's somewhat out of the way for us, we WILL be back! ",5
" Anniversary dinner; wonderful, low-key restaurant located within a large strip mall.  Comfortable, casual dining atmosphere.  They specialize in 'farm-to-table' dishes and most if not all items are organic.  Service was excellent.  Varied unique menu.  My wife ordered the broiled rainbow trout and it was done to melt-in-your mouth perfection.  Side salads were substituted and were delicious.  I opted for the barbecue brisket.  It was so tender it almost melted in your mouth.  Topped with a nice sauce that didn't mask the wonderful flavor of the brisket.  The restaurant gave us a free dessert in honor of our special occaision and we ordered the very large brownie, topped with chocolated sauce, vanilla ice cream, caramel sauce and toffee crumbles.  We inhaled it as it was such a fitting end to a wonderful evening.  Thanks to our server Victoria for making it such a memorable occaision. ",5
 I like the Scottsdale location better.  Server was very attentive and helpful.  Menu is as other locations.  It's a good place to try something different. ,4
 I’ve don’t hear a few times and enjoy the atmosphere in the quality of food. On this particular evening ahead desire for the barbecue and enjoyed it immensely. ,5
 Awesome service and food! We threw a surprise bridal shower and the staff was more than flexible! ,5
 Loved our server great sense of humor and needed with our grump bunch ,5
" This was our first time at this establishment.  We had seen many good reviews on the restaurant and wanted to give it a try.  We were seated at a great booth.  We started with the Common Ground Burrata appetizer.  It was so very tasty.  The Jammin' Spicy Tomato jam was out of this world.   And you can buy a pint to take home.  Then we ordered the Short Ribs and the Brisket.  They both came with the amazingly yummy Jalapeño Cheese Grits.  Don't let the Jalapeño scare you, it was just the right amount of hot.  And I don't like hot.   The Shorts ribs just fell apart and were so juicy.  My date ordered the Brisket, but he liked my Short Ribs a little better.  We had a fabulous waitress, that surprised us with the Chocolate Toffee Brownie.  It was so delicious.  It was the perfect ending to a great evening at Grassroots.  We will be back. ",5
" Great food choices, excellent wait staff, nice place to meet friends coming from different directions within the metro area.  We will be back! ",4
 We have dined at Grassroots for years and but the service for our holiday staff lunch was offensive and non-attentive which we have never experienced before. ,2
" Always love Grassroots, we eat there a few times a month and take out of town guests there as well, they NEVER disappoint! ",5
" Grassroots is one of the consistently great restaurants in the valley.  My friends and I have had a great experience there every single time.   We have enjoyed both locations in Scottsdale and Phoenix.  Our server, Eliza, was excellent.  Our food was prompt and amazing.  They have the best pork chop and pork belly in town.  In a sea of many great restaurant options, we keep coming back to Grassroots. ",5
 Wonderful! Good food! A perfect evening with the woman I love. ,5
" Great service, fantastic food and lovely atmosphere. ",5
 Excellent food and service. Nice menu with a good variety of dishes. ,5
 Good food great service!  Always nice people that work there! ,5
 Service was fantastic. Food always great. ,4
 So good! The shrimp and grits was over the top amazing! ,5
 Food is always wonderful as is the service. We keep going back! ,5
" My husband and I were visiting Phoenix for a brief vacation and looked for a unique establishment for brunch and found GRASSROOTS. We were glad we made reservations there. The food was wonderful, just what we looking for, not too heavy a meal. Our waitress was very friendly and sincere. Next time we're in Phoenix, we'll dine again at GRASSROOTS and maybe bring some friends. ",4
 Will probably return but vegetarian options are very slim. ,4
" Very good food, good service, and busy  but well managed. Will definitely go back ",5
 Celebrated three birthdays on one night. Had a great time. Service was great and food tasty. We were surprised when our server brought us 3 pieces of cake! So sweet! ,5
" WE WERE VERY PLEASED WITH OUR ""date night"". Our waitress was very helpful and took the time to  explain the menu. ",5
 Food was OK--menu all over the map---not  really Italian and a bit overpriced on some items !! Sever was not very attentive--had to ask for refill of drinks --this was not a busy evening--going back for me is probably iffy !!! ,2
" Great pace for brunch on Sunday, we found our new Sunday restaurant . ",5
" We originally were sat at a little two seater table in the far corner which my wife and I aren't a fan of. However, they were very polite and accommodating when we asked to just sit at the bar. It was a great call because the bartender was super friendly and helpful when ordering everything. All the drinks and food we ordered were fantastic and the service was terrific. We will definitely be back. ",5
" Nathan was our waiter, and he did a great job explaining the bar, and dinner menue. The ingredients in all the dishes came out fresh and very delicous.  You can not go wrong with anything on the menue.  Check it out!!! ",5
" Our second visit in just a week. Great food, Filets were perfect. My  wife had flat iron steak and said it was  the best she had  ever had. Cocktails were good.  The service was excellent, was not rushed at all. ",5
 The food was excellent and the service was great. My wife and I celebrated our anniversary here and the server was kind enough to bring us a small dessert for the occasion. We'd both recommend trying it out. ,4
 It was our second time there and this time for my 50th birthday. Great food and service. ,5
 Whenever we visit Phoenix we always enjoying dining out a Grassroots.  The food is great and the stsff is always friendly and recommending different goods to try ,5
 Trey our waiter was fantastic! He read our table immediately and had a lot of fun with us. ,5
 Food was very good &amp; wait staff was super helpful with selections. ,5
 The food here is incredible. Southern inspired comfort food will satisfy your taste buds from start to finish. A group of four of us came here one evening and every dish we ordered was fantastic! Will definitely be coming back. ,5
" This restaurant never disappoints.  The food is fresh and enjoys an  inspired preparation.  Desserts are very large.  A few standouts are the braised short rib chili, blackened red fish, apple brined pork chop, salmon, key lime pie and strawberry icebox pie. ",5
 The food was great.  Just everything else seemed a hassle.  Getting a booth after being seated at a tall table with two small children.  Getting refills on drinks.  Being rushed by the server.   Just could have been so much better with such little effort ,2
 Nice lunch with family. Salads were large &amp; tasty. Service was accommodating.  Very difficult to find if unfamiliar with the location ,3
 Absolutely flawless dishes being put out by Chef Gio and his team. DT Gilbert is lucky  to have Nico in the neighborhood. ,5
" The food was excellent; there is no better New England clam chowder outside of Boston, and the shaved prime-rib-and-cheddar sandwich is a favorite for a very good reason.  The service is similarly excellent.  On this occasion, one of the party was so busy that she forgot the lunch meeting, and she was one hour late.  Nonetheless, the staff could not have been more gracious despite having only one person occupy a booth.  An outstanding place to dine. ",5
 You have to see the view from this restaurant. An absolutely spectacular view of Phoenix and the air traffic from Sky Harbor at night. The service was extraordinary and the food was just delicious. A very quiet and relaxed atmosphere. We would definitely go here again. ,5
" I found for the quality of meat, that this steakhouse was fairly overpriced.  I’m not sure if it’s still living off its reputation in the past - but the food was average at best.   I expected to bite into something very tender for the selection and price I paid.  I also found the steak to be on the saltier side.  The wine selection was ok, nothing great. ",2
 Always a not notch experience. Fantastic!!! ,5
" The Stockyards team provides a warm welcome, excellent service and delicious food. ",5
 The service was fantastic. My iced tea and water glasses never got below half full. That's a peave of mine. The waiter was very pleasant. The food was excellent. All four of us were happy. It was a good choice for our lunch. ,5
" Average food for the price.  Food was tasty but was not served hot. It's like they forgot to serve it for a few minutes.  If your not dressed to the standards of the hostess,  she will try to seat you in the bar.😒 ",4
 FANTASTIC!   One of the best ribeye steaks that I have ever eaten! ,5
" Great food and a great environment. I was disappointed that the bar seating was as small as it is. I arrived before my guest for a 5:30 meal and could not sit down at the bar, not enough seating. Plus, someone with a laptop, drinking pop, controlled a table for 4 while many others had to stand, leaning against a rail. I recommend you review your policies associated with such a thing. ",5
" Our waiter Bob, did an excellent job and made the evening very enjoyable. Can’t wait to go back as it’s a must see for visitors as it was the first time my father was in town and able to join us. ",5
" As usual, excellent filet and prime rib! ",4
" Outstanding steak, impeccable service and an all around delightful experience! ",5
" very good food, but very loud, service was very good ",4
 Was fantastic meal with great service ,5
 Always a treat to dine at this first class Arizona Landmark.  Service was excellent as usual and was the perfect place to take our out of town client to.  The food was perfect and the beef was the best tasting entrée I've had for a long time.  It won't be long before I have another reason to visit one of my most favorite restaurants in the valley.  Great job Stockyards team! ,5
" Our group had Filet, Ribeye and Shrimp Scampi and all were excellent. Also like that soup or salad and potato are included, not ala carte. We’ll be back! ",5
 We had an excellent dinner at The Stockyards!  Steaks were delicious and the sides were all great as well. ,5
 Fantastic meal.   Started with a relish tray and dip along with soft hot bread.   Husband ordered special Bison Ribeye with asparagus Parmesan potatoes and cheddar broccoli soup.  I ordered strip steak with Parm potatoes and cheddar soup.   Both steaks were cooked to perfection and simply fantastic.    Our server Bob was also great ,5
" This restaurant came highly recommended but I wasn't overly impressed. Food selection was limited, and the food itself was so so. ",2
 past its prime...needs a new message/theme for the times!!!! ,2

 It was the best food I have ever had. ,5
 Great food! View trumps all! ,4
" We enjoyed our dining experience at Top of the Rock. the view was fabulous as was the food and service. We will definitely go back and certainly recommend it to all. Whenever we have out of town guests we want to impress, this is where we will take them. ",5
" We went to Top of the Rock for brunch as part of our 23rd anniversary celebration. Everything was spectacular! The service couldn't have been better, the food was great, we were never rushed, and it really made our anniversary. It was the perfect choice for brunch. ",5
" We were a bit disappointed with our table. We would have preferred one with a better view, but the maitre de would not reseat us. Not sure whether it was because we made the reservations online. ",4
 The service was a bit slow ,4
 Enjoyed it very much. ,5
" Our evening was nice, the service was good, the view remarkable. The food was just okay, my husbands rissoto was crunchy , not at all creamy, not fully cooked, my steak and lobster were just okay. the tomatoe, smoked mozzarella salad was excellent as well was the lobster bisque. All three in our party said we are glad we went once but, won't be returning. ",3
" I was surprised that the Sunday brunch was of rather average quality and selection considering the price ($46).  The cold seafood selections (crab legs, shrimp, smoked salmon, cioppino, and seaweed salad) were good, but the hot dishes were very overcooked and bland.  The desserts were beautiful, but not that tasty.  The chocolate fountain was fun, but they were often out of both skewers and plates. I guess you pay mainly for the view, which is very nice.  The service was also very good. ",3
 Reliable good place to meet and eat. ,3
" Great food and service. Unfortunately it was so loud, it was really hard to even hear the people at our own table. Probably no different then any other place though really, we just don't go out often enough I suppose - and / or the places we go to are a much different setting. ",4
" Birthdays at the Stockyards Restaurant have become a tradition for me. Consistently good food, service and atmosphere make this my yearly favorite. With almost a half century of dining at the Stockyards, I see no reason to ""try"" something different when satisfaction reigns right here. ",5
 If you're looking for a top notch steak dinner in an old West historical setting the Stockyards never disappoints.  It's my favorite place to take out of town business visitors to. ,5
 I took my friend there for a birthday dinner. The prime rib was cold. The chili was terrible it was like mashed meat with no onions. The muffins that they gave us were stale.  Ambiance was decent however very loud. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. ,1
" Great ambiance for a business dinner, rich in Arizona history which is very intriguing to out of towners.  Food is good quality with great service! ",4
" As usual, the food and service were outstanding.  We had a very special evening from the minute we walked in.  Our server Alice was very attentive, and our meal was more than delicious!  Can't wait to be able to go back! ",5
" The food was very good and hot. The waiter charged too much for the drinks, it was happy hour, he changed the bill. I don't know what happened. If happy hour is 4 to 7 PM then charged the right price!!! ",4
" Our server, Alice, was so great AND INFORMATIVE.  The four of us had such a relaxing dinner and the treat of a strawberry shortcake as anniversary gift.  From the moment we walked in to leaving, everyone, including the manager, were great. ",5
" We had  a small table for 4, but the wait staff kept it clear and tended to us with little disruption to our conversation. Excellent staff. ",5
" Service was outstanding, as usual, however, the prime rib was dry and not cooked to order.  Free strawberry shortcake was nothing to brag about. ",3
 We enjoy eating in the saloon on the upper deck as it is unique and comfortable.   There is a reason this restaurant has been flourishing for 70+ years; highest quality food served by a knowledgeable and friendly waitstaff at a fair market price. Always greeted by management personnel upon entering the restaurant by the hostess station. ,5
" The service was excellent. We had the calf fries as an appetizer and they were very good. The drinks were well mixed and our steaks were done perfectly. The prime rib was perfection. We ordered two different potatoes: the Parmesan stack and the whiskey mashed sweet potatoes - both excellent. The NY Strip steak came with a delicious steak butter. Because it was a birthday in our group, we got a strawberry shortcake on the house that was also delicious, even as full as we were! The western decor and ambience was very nice, and all the patrons while we were there seemed quite happy! ",5
" A great place to visit, but sometimes the service is a bit too frequent to allow for a business meeting ",4
" My wife and I always enjoy our experience at The Stockyards. We had ribeyes, both very flavorful. The ambience is old school elegant. ",5
" This was an amazing place.  The food was only surpassed by the exquisite service!  Bob Hale was not only informative, but very attentive but not overbearing.  His suggestions were on point.  If Bob worked at a Burger King I would go just for that reason... this is no Burger King.  The food was perfect!  5 stars from top to bottom!  Thank you Bob for a fantastic evening.  I will be coming back!!! ",5
 The food was good atmosphere was good but service was slow wait staff was nice kitchen and bar made the dinner drag ,3
 Our waitstaff was amazing! He made New Year's Eve an experience to remember. ,5
 Went there to celebrate my parents 55th wedding anniversary. Had a great meal. Great service and good history. Was worth the drive from Gilbert for sure.  Reasonable prices for top end steak. All four steaks were served perfectly cooked. Not one complaint. ,5
" Superb meal! Presentation, service and quality of food was excellent. Must visit this steakhouse in a Phoenix. ",5
" Excellent service and food.  Though the restaurant is well decorated it is too dark.  Also, group next to us was loud and lacked finer dining etiquitte.  Felt something should have been said. ",5
" Ordered 3 steaks medium rare.  Son’s steak needed to be sent back to kitchen THREE TIMES.   Each time he cut it only to discover it was too rare.  Final time returned it was in 4 sections and charred on the outside. VERY, VERY disappointing.  The compensation was to cover 1 desert and 3 coffees.  This was supposed to be a celebratory dinner for his homecoming.  Steaks is what they are supposed to be best at.  They screwed this up and didn’t make good by us.  WE WONT BE BACK AND WE’LL spread the word about the POOR experience. ",3
 The owners and staff are preserving an iconic restaurant with superb food traditional for the restaurant and superb service.  A great place for lunch or dinner. ,5
" I had very high expectations for our evening!  I read countless reviews and was confident the experience would be memorable.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed on several fronts.  The food, all around, was lukewarm and seemed undercooked.  The serving plates were even cool to the touch.  Our reservation was early in the evening, and I gladly offer the benefit of the doubt; however, a top scale dining establishment such as this, with a long standing tradition in the city, should produce a better “first time” experience.  I will select other “tried and true” alternatives in the Valley for our next meal. ",3
" Nice menu, great food, outstanding service and nice ambiance - well worth the expense, which is a good value ",5
" We came for New Years eve dinner and ordered off the special menu.  Only issue was our risotto ball app was served cold, we were expecting it to be warm to hot. Other than that the mean was fabulous. Will come back to order off normal menu. Our server was amazing I just can't say her name, she was from Spain. ",5
" This place never disappoints! Since it opened in May we have gone on numerous occasions, be it for dinner, happy hour or brunch. The staff is knowledgeable and friendly, and the food is off the charts. ",5
" We waited almost twenty minutes before any server arrived. Food was well prepared, but was generally Luke warm. Lobster bisque would be the best only if it was hot when served. ",4
" Went for nye, great menu, we didn't feel rushed.  Bartenders, servers and all staff were very friendly and accommodating! ",5
" Great food and wine and loved our server, Grace... she is awesome! ",5
" Recognizing that an establishment can only do so much about noisy patrons, there was a large table right next to us that was beyond noisy.  They left when we were about 3/4 finished, and that helped a lot.  We then noticed how noisy it still was, even without that table.  We were never offered any bread, or parmesan cheese for our meal.  $100.00 with no drinks seems like it would be enough for some meal accouterments.  The waitress was friendly and knowledgeable. ",3
" As always the octopus, lasagna, and Nonna's meatballs were outstanding. ",5
 I heard about this place from a colleague several months ago. I wish I had visited it sooner! Great experience and perfect for a date night. ,5
" The food took too long to get out to us. Salmon was too salty, could not even finish it. Meatball app was the best ",3
" Poor service, took an hour for food and many items on the menu were not available. ",2
" I had heard of nothing but good things.  Was terribly disappointed in our experience.  Table of 6 people.  Food was fine but not overly good.  Waited over 50 minutes after eating appetizers  to receive our food.  Was told 3 times by server that food was on way out.  Considering we ordered pasta and fish, I doubt that they were even cooking.   When food received, my rigatoni was cold.   Extremely disappointed in my experience and will not be back nor recommended. ",3
 Food was fantastic. Matthew in the kitchen did a great job. We have been fans of his work from watching television and from other restaurants. Happy to see him there and the food did not disappoint! ,5
" This place was AMAZING. Nestled within downtown Gilbert, the ambiance was incredible and our service was phenomenal. Add that to the incredible food and yummy drinks, I was sold immediately. It was cozy (except for the open doors!) and the atmosphere really sealed the deal.  Be warned, however - the bathrooms are only a one stall per men and women, so you may have to wait a bit for those if needed. However, the charm of this place can't be beat. ",5
" This place is amazing! The food was awesome! We split a few things, the smashed potatoes were so good! The lasagna dish was so flavorful, our server was super informative and made great suggestions on the menu. We will be back for sure! ",5
" really excellent experience.  If you like Virtu, you will like Nico.  Some of the same menu items, but different vibe.  We all enjoyed our meal and the waiter was excellent. ",5
 Our realtor recommended Nico's and surprised us with a gift card.   The food was AMAZING! We will definitely make a return trip and look forward to trying everything on the menu! ,5
" We will definitely go again, we had a great dinner, wonderful ambience. ",5
" We really enjoyed the food, drinks, patio seating and excellent service. Looking forward to going back. ",5
" My first visit and I loved it. Had 3 apps Meatballs, octopus, clams.  All great.   I had the rigatony was amazing rich and fresh pasta.  Had a toffee dessert and it was great. 👍💗 ",5
" Great place-great food-great value!  We have been to this gem of a restaurant twice.  It was outstanding both times.  We find the food particularly good and interesting.  In addition the wait staff was both friendly and knowledgeable.  We also enjoy wine and find the selection of wines very good and not the ""run of the mill"" wines.  Lastly the restaurant goes the ""extra mile"" by keeping the red wines at the correct temperature. ",5
" Wow! I've now been to Nico Heirloom Kitchen twice. I keep looking for an excuse to go back again. We loved all of the festive and tasteful décor, with Christmas music playing in the background. It really felt cozy and made it feel like Christmas was coming.  Every time I go, I am always extremely impressed with the knowledge that the wait staff has. whether you're asking about cocktails, wine, or the food, they are vastly aware of every last nuance. They make the experience truly enjoyable with the information they provide you with on every dish. Sometimes your waiter is the one making your cocktail too, which is cool! We started with the octopus. You will NOT believe it's octopus. The preparation is incredible from the texture to the taste. It's unlike anything I've ever had and I have to order it every time I go.  Our entrees included the Spaghetti pomodoro (with an added meatball), the lasagna, and the rigatoni. The freshly made pastas really make each dish shine. Lasagna has notoriously been one of my more disliked foods, but THIS lasagna is just...so beyond lasagna! I crave this lasagna! The Spaghetti noodles are thick and cooked perfectly al dente. The rigatoni with pork sugo and house made ricotta was rich and decadent. All 3 of us licked our plates clean.  I can't wait for a good reason to go back. I love taking out of town guests here. My new favorite restaurant in Gilbert, and the Phoenix Metro Area! ",5
 Took almost 45 minutes after apps were finished and cleared to get main course. ,3
" Fourth visit for most of our party, but first visit for two. Freaking delicious! Celebration for one guest's upcoming graduation from ASU, could not have asked for a better night. Love, love, love the Rigatoni with Pork Sugo; left enough to take home for the next day's breakfast! Server, Justin, was awesome and completely on top of everything. So glad to have Nico Heirloom Kitchen right here in Gilbert. ",5
 A gem in downtown Gilbert. The pork ragu is our favorite. ,5
" good restaurant serving memorable meals The menu is somewhat small but there are gems on it. The Lasagna and Rigatoni are outstanding. Our group beats early, 5 pm, and service was slow.  It appeared to be 1 server for the room which wasn't crowded. Took awhile to get our order in and to get our food. I think they cook everything from scratch so can accept the longer preparation time. ",4
" We love Nico Heirloom Kitchen.  Our server Toby was so pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu, the cocktails,  everything!  I highly recommend going for brunch,  lunch, or anytime. The bottomless mimosas and belinnis were fabulous!  I enjoyed a Manhattan cocktail - soooo delicious! My birthday celebration was even more special because of the delicious food and Toby's warm, attentive service. ",5
 The lasagna and octopus are out of this world. The staff are well trained and courteous. This is  great addition to the roster of restaurants in the the Heritage District of Gilbert. It is at the higher end of pricing but an excellent value. ,5
" Our experience was phenomenal from the moment we walked in, to the moment we walked out. The server was more than willing to answer questions regarding the menu. The food was outstanding. I had the Flat Iron Steak and my Fiance had a grilled Salmon dish that was added to the menu this week. My fiance is a vegetarian and they were able to accommodate her request to cook the Brussel sprouts without using bacon. We will certainly return when we have the chance. ",5
 A total recommend!!   Food and Service were outstanding.  A lively spot along a busy street with lots of competition among restaurants.  This was a huge hit!! ,5
 Fabulous! Their homemade pasta is incredible. This is our favorite restaurant in Gilbert! We love Nico! ,5
" It was a neat experience at a newly opened restaurant. Menu is very interesting bit not really large. The lasagna was excellent but was a bit different than normal lasagna. Wife finished it all. The rigatoni was well made and full of flavor. We were near the front next to the patio outdoor eating. It was a little cool. We were eating early, 5:15, and were promptly seated. We ordered but it took a long time for the food to appear. I think dishes are cooked to order and maybe the kitchen wasn't up to speed yet at the early time. All in all, we will go back again. ",4
 We loved every minute and every bite. We had visited for lunch and loved it so much that we brought our whole family back for a dinner the day after Thanksgiving. Everyone had a great time. Our new favorite! ,5
" Went to Nico's for a birthday celebration with 5 other adults. We had 2 vegans in the party  and although the menu said vegan/vegetarian options available, all the waitress recommended was to remove cheese from a salad.  However, everyone thought the food was insanely delicious and cleaned their plates. The value seemed decent and the mimosas were bottomless which was a very nice value and surprise. Overall, a  cute foodie gem that is good for groups as well as intimate dates. ",4
 Our entrees were great tasting. We got the butterscotch pudding (not sure of the exact name) for dessert and it was by far the best dessert I have ever tasted. The service was excellent as well. We will most definitely be back. ,5
" Great food, great service, great location! The sea salt fries are wonderful. ",5
 Waiter was very helpful with explaining menu and offering suggestions when asked ,5
 Was looking forward to an entrée I'd had on a previous visit (Veal Marsala) which was not on the menu.  I requested of the server if it might be available and it was.  Appreciated their meeting my request. ,4
 Food was just average.  Service was good but slow.  Dessert was excellent!  I recommend the butterscotch pudding.  I am a regular for brunch and recommend it over dinner. ,3
" The food and service were really great! Can't wait to go back again. Aside from the food, we loved the iced tea. And I thought tea was tea...  Also the menu has a nice selection and variety. ",5
" The food was excellent; there is no better New England clam chowder outside of Boston, and the shaved prime-rib-and-cheddar sandwich is a favorite for a very good reason.

" Outstanding steak, impeccable service and an all around delightful experience! ",5
" very good food, but very loud, service was very good ",4
 Was fantastic meal with great service ,5
 Always a treat to dine at this first class Arizona Landmark.  Service was excellent as usual and was the perfect place to take our out of town client to.  The food was perfect and the beef was the best tasting entrée I've had for a long time.  It won't be long before I have another reason to visit one of my most favorite restaurants in the valley.  Great job Stockyards team! ,5
" Our group had Filet, Ribeye and Shrimp Scampi and all were excellent. Also like that soup or salad and potato are included, not ala carte. We’ll be back! ",5
 We had an excellent dinner at The Stockyards!  Steaks were delicious and the sides were all great as well. ,5
 Fantastic meal.   Started with a relish tray and dip along with soft hot bread.   Husband ordered special Bison Ribeye with asparagus Parmesan potatoes and cheddar broccoli soup.  I ordered strip steak with Parm potatoes and cheddar soup.   Both steaks were cooked to perfection and simply fantastic.    Our server Bob was also great ,5
" Great food and service. Unfortunately it was so loud, it was really hard to even hear the people at our own table. Probably no different then any other place though really, we just don't go out often enough I suppose - and / or the places we go to are a much different setting. ",4
" Birthdays at the Stockyards Restaurant have become a tradition for me. Consistently good food, service and atmosphere make this my yearly favorite. With almost a half century of dining at the Stockyards, I see no reason to ""try"" something different when satisfaction reigns right here. ",5
 If you're looking for a top notch steak dinner in an old West historical setting the Stockyards never disappoints.  It's my favorite place to take out of town business visitors to. ,5
 I took my friend there for a birthday dinner. The prime rib was cold. The chili was terrible it was like mashed meat with no onions. The muffins that they gave us were stale.  Ambiance was decent however very loud. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. ,1
" Great ambiance for a business dinner, rich in Arizona history which is very intriguing to out of towners.  Food is good quality with great service! ",4
" As usual, the food and service were outstanding.  We had a very special evening from the minute we walked in.  Our server Alice was very attentive, and our meal was more than delicious!  Can't wait to be able to go back! ",5
" The food was very good and hot. The waiter charged too much for the drinks, it was happy hour, he changed the bill. I don't know what happened. If happy hour is 4 to 7 PM then charged the right price!!! ",4
" Our server, Alice, was so great AND INFORMATIVE.  The four of us had such a relaxing dinner and the treat of a strawberry shortcake as anniversary gift.  From the moment we walked in to leaving, everyone, including the manager, were great. ",5
" We had  a small table for 4, but the wait staff kept it clear and tended to us with little disruption to our conversation. Excellent staff. ",5
" Service was outstanding, as usual, however, the prime rib was dry and not cooked to order.  Free strawberry shortcake was nothing to brag about. ",3
 We enjoy eating in the saloon on the upper deck as it is unique and comfortable.   There is a reason this restaurant has been flourishing for 70+ years; highest quality food served by a knowledgeable and friendly waitstaff at a fair market price. Always greeted by management personnel upon entering the restaurant by the hostess station. ,5
" The service was excellent. We had the calf fries as an appetizer and they were very good. The drinks were well mixed and our steaks were done perfectly. The prime rib was perfection. We ordered two different potatoes: the Parmesan stack and the whiskey mashed sweet potatoes - both excellent. The NY Strip steak came with a delicious steak butter. Because it was a birthday in our group, we got a strawberry shortcake on the house that was also delicious, even as full as we were! The western decor and ambience was very nice, and all the patrons while we were there seemed quite happy! ",5
" A great place to visit, but sometimes the service is a bit too frequent to allow for a business meeting ",4
" My wife and I always enjoy our experience at The Stockyards. We had ribeyes, both very flavorful. The ambience is old school elegant. ",5
" This was an amazing place.  The food was only surpassed by the exquisite service!  Bob Hale was not only informative, but very attentive but not overbearing.  His suggestions were on point.  If Bob worked at a Burger King I would go just for that reason... this is no Burger King.  The food was perfect!  5 stars from top to bottom!  Thank you Bob for a fantastic evening.  I will be coming back!!! ",5
 The food was good atmosphere was good but service was slow wait staff was nice kitchen and bar made the dinner drag ,3
 Our waitstaff was amazing! He made New Year's Eve an experience to remember. ,5
 Went there to celebrate my parents 55th wedding anniversary. Had a great meal. Great service and good history. Was worth the drive from Gilbert for sure.  Reasonable prices for top end steak. All four steaks were served perfectly cooked. Not one complaint. ,5
" Superb meal! Presentation, service and quality of food was excellent. Must visit this steakhouse in a Phoenix. ",5
" Excellent service and food.  Though the restaurant is well decorated it is too dark.  Also, group next to us was loud and lacked finer dining etiquitte.  Felt something should have been said. ",5
" Ordered 3 steaks medium rare.  Son’s steak needed to be sent back to kitchen THREE TIMES.   Each time he cut it only to discover it was too rare.  Final time returned it was in 4 sections and charred on the outside. VERY, VERY disappointing.  The compensation was to cover 1 desert and 3 coffees.  This was supposed to be a celebratory dinner for his homecoming.  Steaks is what they are supposed to be best at.  They screwed this up and didn’t make good by us.  WE WONT BE BACK AND WE’LL spread the word about the POOR experience. ",3
 The owners and staff are preserving an iconic restaurant with superb food traditional for the restaurant and superb service.  A great place for lunch or dinner. ,5
" I had very high expectations for our evening!  I read countless reviews and was confident the experience would be memorable.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed on several fronts.  The food, all around, was lukewarm and seemed undercooked.  The serving plates were even cool to the touch.  Our reservation was early in the evening, and I gladly offer the benefit of the doubt; however, a top scale dining establishment such as this, with a long standing tradition in the city, should produce a better “first time” experience.  I will select other “tried and true” alternatives in the Valley for our next meal. ",3
" Emily (she is a delight) seated us outside as requested. Very comfortable, cozy garden. We shared the asparagus egg salad and the burrata (just the right creaminess). The branzino fish has a crispy sear and spiced well. The pork was tasty though a bit overdone. The flat iron was cooked perfectly and served with 2 large very spicy, smoky peppers. Karly was a pleasant and knowledgeable server suggesting a French wine well suited to all dishes. The ambiance outside is nice and less noisy than inside dining. Overall a great evening. ",4
" I have eaten at Virtu a number of times as I live in the neighborhood. The food is always excellent. The service this time was a bit strange. The waitress pushed us to order quickly and entirely. When I told her that we would order our wine, then our appetizers and then our main course, and that we were in no rush, she said, ""The kitchen would like to have the entire order as everything takes time."" This made me think of chain restaurants where the turnover is essential. I ordered my way and the food still came out perfectly and in a timely manner, and the overall service was good. The food is so great at Virtu that the meal should be allowed to be an event and should not be rushed. ",4
 The food is excellent -- some of the best in Scottsdale. Service is attentive and pleasant---nice outdoor patio. ,5
" Cannot say enough good things about Virtu. The food is spectacularly good--it was one of the best meals we have had in the last year. We chose charred octopus appetizer, smoked duck and seared raw ahi entrees, balsalmic-soaked figs with mascarpone gelato for dessert and an accompaniment of a bottle of Burgundy pinot noir. The service starting with the maitre d and the waiter was top notch. We called because we were going to be late and the maitre d graciously held the table. And we got great recommendations from our female waiter. We sat outside under the trees and it was magical. In sum, run don't walk to Virtu. There is a reason why it has been chosen as one of the best new restaurants in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area. Its fantastic! ",5
" restaurant is poorly designed, one has to walk through a very crowded tight spaced room, interrupt diners while they eat to actually check-in with the greeter. It is a small place inside, noisy and people were cramped inside. Our party sat outside which was quieter but yet the table we sat at was in the dark literally. The menu was well rounded with nice choices overall but the entrees were oversized servings especially the pork dish. I know some people enjoy large servings in general but the pork could have served at least 3 of us! The wine list was atrocious, poor selection as well as dramatically overpriced. The presentation of our entrees was nothing like the pictures on their website, it was unattractive, and sloppy looking. ",1
" We really enjoyed our evening at this restaurant. We felt like we took a mini vacation, as the service was great, and our food a delight to the eyes, and delicious to eat. A relaxing, enjoyable time! ",5
" What a beautiful little restaurant, in the middle of Old Town Scottsdale. If you were blindfolded and taken there, you would believe that you were somewhere else. Besides from that, killer cocktails and incredible food. Definitely a place that I will return many times again. Highly recommended, if my review was not clear enough. ",5
" Great place for creative presentations and flavors, Bartender has nice innovation menu ",4
" Came prepared to like this well-reviewed restaurant. Delighted we could sit outside on an unseasonably warm February. Beautiful outdoor patio area. The servers were very pleasant, but don't know if it was the bar that got backed up, but took at least 20 minutes, if not longer, to get our cocktails and that was after repeated requests. To make matters worse, our appetizer (the octopus which was good) came even before our drinks. We noticed nearby tables were also having trouble getting their orders. My husband's pork porterhouse was okay, my branzino was definitely fishy and not worth finishing. They did deduct the glass of wine we had with dinner as a consolation. Hopefully it was just an off night. ",3
" Hard to find anything negative about this dining experience. We wanted something unique, high quality and out of the ordinary for a two-some special evening. We found this neat hole in the wall, with outdoor seating, great waiter, cocktails, interesting but nice wines, and food so good we're planning our next visits. These folks really try to make the experience special, and they did our estimation. They pledge to use local fresh foods, and live up to that promise in their produce and vegetables. My wife had scallops which were great, and my filet was one of the very best I've had. And we're from Dakota beef country. We'll be back soon. ",5
" Don't walk, run to this exceptional restaurant! The four of us were super impressed. It is charming, food looks gorgeous, everything is delicious. The octopus was perfectly grilled and tasty. The black pasta with sausage and octopus, (yes, I had octopus appetizer AND first course) was perfectly cooked. The duck excellent, the scallops perfect. The tiramisu had more chocolate than usual and was not overly sweet. Even the coffee was really good. A great experience, to be repeated soon! ",5
 food was fantastic..small menu but everything we tried was tasty..imaginative combinations and beautifully presented. The service was not just attentive but knowledgeable .. made wonderful recommendations From starter through desert it was a treat ,5
"  great patio for snow birds, bar scene is fun for people watching great dinner and service ",4
 Esquire Magazine listed it as one of USA's 20 best new restaurants so we came and agreed! Mediterranean inspired dishes with a twist! The grilled octopus appears in a few dishes-- all I've had-- and I loved them all! Great place in a tucked away location close to old town Scottsdale and its familiar Art Walk scene. ,5
" Anna called to confirm a 5:45p reservation adding we will need to be done with our meal by 7:30p as there is another party booked. That felt rude. In conversation with manager Michael Cozzi, he felt this was a friendly thing to do. Our opinions do not match. If the owner is concerned that patrons do not have enough time to eat, they should follow a better booking policy. And, by no means make a party feel less important and pushed out. Recommending Virtu will include this negative side note. We did enjoy our meal. The egg and asparagus is the best though the winter vegetable salad was light and so flavorful, too. The tuna was flat and needed more pizazz. ",4
 Food and service are superb--kudos to the chef and management ,5
" Such a wonderful place. Charming atmosphere. Excellent service and delicious food with a lot of high quality taste and presentation. Our waitress, Emily, new the menu as if she cooked it herself. Very impressive. Chef Geo is amazing! The grilled octopus appetizer is a MUST. ",5
" Read about Virtu in the WSJ piece on Phoenix. Were seated outdoors, a little chilly, but the hostess fired up the outdoor heater next to our table and brought me an oh-so soft blanket for my shoulders. Adorable patio. Festive lights strung overhead, pretty flowers next to our table, spotless clean. Outstanding waitstaff. I would put Virtu up with the best food we've ever had. Hubby started with the beef/tuna tartare. Served in little mason jars on a beautifully done plate, the tuna had 3 distinct phases, first sweet, then perfect ahi tuna, then a little heat. A marvel. The beef tartare was topped by some magic cream that we never did figure out, although it was transporting. From starters to dessert, everything was EXTRAORDINARY. Go. ",5
" Food was very good, service very good, ambiance on patio was delightful (although no misters for summer), but inside, although very attractive, was beyond noisy We were fortunate to sit outside, and when went inside to bathroom, all of us were overwhelmed by the noise inside. But a wonderful dining experience for us! ",4
" We enjoy everything about this new, special restaurant. Chef is very accommodating to modify dishes and has vegetarian/vegan options upon request. ",4
 My wife and I had the Squid Ink pasta. Awesome! The Octopus starter is a must. We will return. ,5
" This is a gem of a little restaruant. Food was great. Had several interesting cocktails, wine list by both bottle and glass are unique, not the normal Sonoma Cutrer,,,deserts didn't trip the trigger, but everythng else was off the charts.... ",5
" the highlight of this place is the food ingredients and plating of the dishes. it is so very different and special. very interesting things going on within the plate. including balsamic paste, spicy aioli for the octopus tentacles, and generally very cool usage of eggs within dishes etc. andn the food was delicious. service was good, ambience ok, wine list sucked although one shud be able to get a chardonnay or a coherent if that's wanted. but overall about a 4 star deal and could easily get to 5 if they address these other issues. ",4
" Virtu is tucked away in a quiet section of downtown Scottsdale which is a plus in our book. The menu has a variety of items to please your group; the scallops, pork chop and filet were outstanding. We'll be back soon. ",5
" As tourists to Scottsdale we were guided by WallStreetJournal's Jan 18 article on the Phoenix scene...our dinner featured four excellent meal and intriguing mixologist productions. ONLY suggestion during the few nippy evenings of this season, call to verify whether you are being assigned an outside table. Although they provide very efficient heaters, one would be better served to have that one extra layer, so as not to detract from a superb dining experience. ",5
" This place is very cool and i would highly recommend it if the staff was a little more personal. The space is great, food wonderful and in all a great find. But... the server was very high brow and acted like i was a pauper asking to dine with the queen. The ambiance does not seem to fit snooty waiters. I made the reservation about two weeks prior, mentioned that it was a special occasion and asked for a romantic table. When we arrived (on time) i asked to sit outside (i had no idea, we are from out of town) but was told that they could not accommodate us (80% of the tables were empty). Instead we were directed to the table closest to the restrooms. My wife would have strangled the guy but i held her back as it was her birthday... ",4
" We thoroughly enjoyed dining on the lovely, relaxing patio that was outfitted with a sufficient number of heaters. Most important though, the food is tops. Esquire magazine recently name Virtu one of its top restaurants in the US. Our appetizers included the octopus and salads featuring winter root vegetables. Entrees: duck, ahi and scallops. All were wonderful in the preparation and presentation. Desserts: a flourless chocolate torte, key lime pie in a mason jar and the mascarpone gelato. All earned raves. The serves was quite attentive.  Virtu is an excellent restaurant. You will leave having had a fabulous dining experience. We do not know and are not related to the owners or chef. :) I highly recommend the virtues of Virtu. ",5
" Delightful,with excellent food and warm personality.Authentic.No crowds,no bar scene,no background music outside thank god,just a pretty patio lit with strings of lights and stars,with very honest and well-conceived menu,perfectly executed.This will sound odd,but it reminds me of meals I've had in small towns in Tuscany/Umbria/Sicily,sitting outside someone's home/restaurant. The menu is NOT Italian (see website for menu) but the chef is. There are plenty of good restaurants in Scottsdale, but this one is ... different. No gimmicks. Not a chain. And no clicheed dishes on the menu. If you like FnB, Atlas Bistro, Citizens Pub House, BInk's Cafe.... then you really should try Virtu. It's better than many (no, not all, but many) of them. ",5
" Now let's be honest, Scottsdale has a plethora of good restaurants. Generally, the difficulty is in finding a unique restaurant that provides a food experience you can't find elsewhere. Well that's what Virtu Honest Craft provides. The food and drink menus were unlike any we've seen in the other restaurants around Scottsdale. The location was so quaint and off the beaten path in Old Town that we missed it the first time we went by. The restaurant was just DIFFERENT, but in a great way. From our appetizers and cocktails down to the dessert, we didn't have one single complaint about the food, service, or the experience at the restaurant. It lived up to the hype of one of the best new restaurants in the US...and now one of our favorites ",5
" Emily greeted us warmly and engaged in fun conversation. Our server was a bit snarly, but the service overall ok. The duck was fantastic...thick slices cooked rare. The tuna was on the boring side. The egg and asparagus was a hit, perhaps more than the famed octopus. Wine selection was good throughout the meal finishing with a lovely port. As words travels, your ears will ring later from the noisy room. Might try the patio in future. ",4
 We had an amazing time - the food was great and the staff was friendly and efficient. ,5
 Virtu is a perfect restaurant for a birthday dinner with friends. We had a group of seven and sat inside. Next time I will definitely sit outside on their lovely patio. Wonderful place! I will tell many people about this place. Just hope they don't all go when I want to go as it's not a very large place. Make reservations early!! ,5
" Had read a decent review in a local paper, and thought it was worth a try. My wife and I were dazzled by the food, the knowledge and friendliness of the staff - we had a great time. There is no doubt we will return often. ",5
" The only complaint we had was mostly to do with ""open table"". When I made this reservation, there was nowhere on their website that said it was ""an outdoor reservation"" and that the inside tables were already spoken for. When we arrived, we were told that the indoor tables weren't available. Fortunately we were early and after arguing how unfair it was, they were nice enough to seat us inside with a time limit that was plenty of time for us. Both Virtu and the open table website need to work out this problem. If we had wanted an outside table we would have requested one. Please remedy this glitch, thank you. Everything else was fabulous. I will make future reservations directly with Virtul,not open table for now anyway. ",5
 Was in town for a trip and went here on a recommendation. The food and service was excellent. Ambiance on their back patio couldn't have been more lovely. If I lived in Scottsdale I would go back again &amp; again! ,5
" Seated quickly after arriving for our reservation. Wanted the patio, but hadn't specified, seated in the small inner dining room - a bustling area - folks obviously enjoying the evening. Our server quickly stopped to say she just seated 2 large groups, and she would be with us asap. (I applaud we were not left sitting there without interaction). Kitchen caught up quickly - service was attentive and balanced. The small menu has a little something for everyone across meat, fish, pasta etc. Grilled Octopus appetizer was memorable. Branzino absolutely A++. Portions are spot on. Full bar with great bartender but the small wine list needs a few more mid priced bottles matched to entrees. So good we considered returning the next night..UG ",4
" Having seen rave reviews for Virtu from food critics and open table dinners decided to give it a try. Had a party of 6. Virtu has a small indoor dining area and a larger patio/ garden dining area. Was told we would be on the patio, which in January can be iffy, but that they had plenty of heaters and no complaints from other diners. The server was absolutely delightful, knowledgeable about the menu and wine list. The menu and wine list did not disappoint. The food not only is excellent, but fabulously presented. The garden setting is lovely. Only complaint, the heater propane ran out 1/2 way through the evening and made for a less than great end to what was otherwise a lovely evening. ",4
" We enjoyed Virtu very much. We shared freshly grilled calamari appetizer and special arancini balls. We really liked the lamb chops. We were seated outdoors and it is a lovely patio with many heaters so we were not chilly. I did find that the food (apps especially) did not come to the table hot. I also felt that there could have been less salt used in the preparation. Also...we did not order dessert, but I had called ahead to inform the restaurant it was my boyfriend's birthday....and since we didn't ""order"" a dessert, they did not bring anything!? I had hoped he could make a wish and blow out a candle. We will return as we so enjoyed the al fresco dining!! ",4
 Loved the food and the fact that Michael was willing to open our wine before arrival so it could breathe. If you don't like noise try to get an outside table. This restaurant is within walking distance for us so we will definitely return. Best scallops ever! ,4
 Very pretty spot. Food was beautifully presented and delicious. Wine list offers amazing variety for the size. Deserts were a little disappointing. ,4
" Zero complaints about this restaurant. The food, the service, the atmosphere all were fantastic. ",5
" Ron's service was, as always, impeccable. Our steaks were perfect. This is our go-to place! ",5
" Unassuming location but you found it by all the cars in the parking lot on a Wednesday Night.  Very diverse menu and service was top notch, the super fresh baked bakery offerings was a special treat.  Highly recommended. ",5
 Great for lunch. But a little loud. Excellent food and service. ,5
 The fillets were excellent and the services was very well paced. The wine list was ok. We thought that $25 for a call brand drink was a lot. We pay $59 for a 1.5 liter bottle of the same whiskey. ,4
" Once again, I (we) were not disappointed... This is one of my ""special"" restaurants int he Phoenix area, and Gary and staff have never let me down. Excellent service, great drinks, and the food selection is outstanding...both in selection, quality, and price. If you have not been, you MUST...then you too will become a repeat customer. ",5
" The Stockyards Restaurant in Scottsdale AZ is a real old-school classic.  The restaurant has been around since the days when Scottsdale-Phoenix was a railhead for the shipment of beef cattle to the east.  While the neighborhood has gone toward light industrial, the Stockyards Restaurant has continued to hold up its high levels of quality and service.  Our most recent visit was punctuated by Ron, our server, who has been at the game a long time and really knows his stuff.  His fine work really enhanced our meal.  Going to the menu, the greatest problem is trying to decide among the many tempting offerings.  Everything we had was properly prepared, well seasoned and quite delicious.  Among the best.  We'll be back. ",5
" Absolutely a perfect meal. Realistic portions, great food, excellent service in a beautiful place that reeks of tradition. Some unusual choices on the menu, such as elk, which was amazing! Pretty expensive, but worth it. ",5
" Put simply, great service and very good food. They have a nice wine list without being over fancy, but the service was the star. Attentive without being pushy. ",5
 This was our 38th anniversary.  We gave an overall 5 stars.   A restaurant jewel that few people know about. ,5
" Excellent service with good explanation of menu choices, recommendations, and an adequate wine list. We'll definitely come back. ",4
 I have been here many times in the past 30 years of living in Arizona for business lunches. Great food and a totally awesome staff. ,5
" Everything about our experience there tonight exceeded our expectations. Veggie dish and bread were brought to our table quickly. Nice touch. The waitress was knowledgeable, friendly (but authentically and not overly), accommodating, and professional! The timing of every part of the meal was perfect. We even got to finish our salads before the main course was served—a lost art today. The food was hot, and prepared exactly as we ordered it (oh, and delicious). Every staff member we encountered was friendly, helpful and unobtrusive when it mattered. We ordered pretty standard cocktails, but they were better tasting than most. Extensive wine list. What a pleasure to have such a fantastic restaurant experience in this ""fast food"" age. ",5
 Awesome food and great ambiance.  Nice service.  Pleasant atmosphere. ,4
 A standard for business lunches. Best burgers around. ,5
 Stake is a must ,4
 Great place to grab a drink at the bar then have a conversation over dinner without noise drowning out the conversation. ,5
" The location is close to the airport, so whenever we fly out of Phoenix we allow time for dinner at Stockyards.  This trip we both dined on ribeyes.  The steaks were phenomenal.  It had been a while since our last trip and we forgot how good the food is.  Ron, our server, was helpful, attentive and not overbearing.  Highly recommended. ",5
 Excellent service. Both of our steaks cooked to perfection ! Very nice evening for celebrating our 23rd Anniversary. ,5
" Awesome place! Everything was great. Yes it is somewhat expensive, but as with everything, you usually get what you pay for. ",5
" John the waiter was great!  Informative and very helpful.  This was our first time to visit the Stockyards.  We have lived in Phoenix for many years.  We enjoyed our 39th Anniversary, and the  waiter made it very special for us.  Thanks! ",5
 Great food - Excellent Service and an overall great experience ,5
 The lunch was great. We both enjoyed it. I'm bringing my wife to lunch the first chance we get. ,5
 Great steakhouse for my husband's birthday! ,5
" Our dinner was outstanding, couldn't have been better....definitely will be back, if your looking for a great steak this is the place ",5
 It was our first trip there but won't be the last. The food was fabulous and we were treated as if we were the only ones there. It was a great place to spend time with family that we don't see much.  We'll be there again soon! ,5
" We are from KC in for Spring Training and looking for a romantic spot to spend our anniversary. I mentioned that we would be dining there for our anniversary when I made the reservation. From the moment we walked in the door we received great service. The hostess wished us a happy anniversary, as well as the waiter, and they made it special- we had a fantastic date night. The food was AMAZING!! I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking to spend a romantic evening with wonderful food and atmosphere. ",5
 We took our boss here for his birthday lunch. We were surprised at the options outside of their well known steaks but the food was very tasty. Not completely happy about the seafood but it was okay. ,4
" Our experience was wonderful.  Very informative server, everything was included, lots of choices. ",5
 The Stockyards always delivers on both the quality of food and service.   We visit the Stockyards several times a year before going to the ballet and they never disappoint. ,5
" Wasn't too impressed with the 12 oz ribeye I had.  It was a bit tough and was not easy to cut and I got it medium rare.  Seemed to be some tough strings in it and some difficulty cutting it.  Was disappointed in this part of the meal.  Other than that, the rest of the meal and the service was great. ",4
 Great food as usual. Attentive waiter. We had asked for a to-go container which didn't make it back to our table until we were ready to leave and then had to ask for it. A favorite restaurant. ,4
 An old friend came to town and wanted a great steak so we took him to Stckyards and it didn't disappoint! Was able to get John Wayne's both and loved talking about it and some of the history!!! Waiter was very nice and made everyone comfortable w/ the just perfect amount of humor and attentiveness by him and rest of staff. ,5
" The food was excellent, on the pricey side which is fine.  However the dress code was sorely lacking, shorts, baseball caps, etc...would have been nice to have it more upscale at those prices.  But again food was great.  We also liked the Saloon decor. ",4
" My wife and I were introduced to the Stockyard Restaurant in 1996 and have been enjoying the good food there with friends on special occasions. We are snow birds from Canada and consider this restaurant to offer some of the best Arizona food fare anywhere. On this occasion, we were introducing our very close friends to a great dining experience. We were not disappointed as our friends were totally taken a back with the great setting, food and excellent service. You can expect to have gained new followers as a result. ",4
 Food was excellent and the service was great. Would recommend it to friends. ,5
 This was a working lunch. My staff wanted a good steak and the stockyard came to mind.  It's been 30 years since my last visit and if was as if I walked into a time warp   Just as wonderful as I remember.  Good food at good prices .  Go!  You won't be disappointed! ,5
" So many great reviews -- what happened? I'm not sure. The ambiance was cool and our server was exceptional, but the food -- not so much. We had the prime rib and ribeye. It was bland and boring. Not bad - just not good. Bummer! ",3
" Great server, food was great....just a fun time . Will be back next time in town. ",5
" In from Vegas for business, first visit, absolutely loved it. I wish the meat was a bit higher quality grade, mine was a bit chewy, but everything else great! (March 2017) ",4
" After a long flight in to Phoenix I always enjoy the patio at this wonderful lunch spot. The food portions are huge, the beautiful outdoor patio is breathtaking and it is a great way to unwind on a warm afternoon. I love to dine here. ",4
" I took visitors from Norway to this restaurant because it was at the Biltmore and they are Wright fans. They loved the place. Having ""American"" food is good for visitors from Europe. Our server had just been to Norway so that was a plus. ",5
" The AZ Biltmore Hotel has done a nice job transforming the old grill. Our service, by Brad, was excellent. The food, however, was a little slow in coming which wasn't a huge issue for us since we were a group in conversation and were sipping wine... but those expecting prompt food turnaround might be in for a little wait. The calamari were a little too salty and the grouper slightly over-cooked. The ""duck-fat"" fries were great and the veggies cooked to perfection. ",3
" I had the meatloaf, and it was the best. The mashed potatoes and spinach were delicious also. The dessert was yummy too. The server did a great job. I love all the fireplaces and the waterfall. We sat in the open area where the sliding planels were open, but an elderly couple wanted them closed, which was disappointing because we loved feeling like we were both inside and outside at the same time. Frank and Albert's has a fun menu and beautiful ambiance and is fairly reasonably priced. I will definitely return. ",5
 This was our first time to this restaurant and we really enjoyed it! The Biltmore Hotel is rich with history and it is fun to walk around before or after dinner. The food was very upscale comfort food. We particularly enjoyed the mac and cheese and onion rings. Portions are generous and can easily be shared. ,4
 Frank and Albert's was great as always. Please keep up the good work and service and turn the funky music down a bit.(or change the channel!)  Thank you! ,5
" Great restaurant! Nice selection of food, not super pricey and great service. ",5
 Comfort food done with a twist. If you are staying at the resort this is highly recommended. The ambiance was excellent and during our New Year's celebration we were able to end dinner outside with an offering of s'mores. It was great. ,4
 THe food and service were excellent. Great way to begin the new year. ,5
" My first dining experience at Frank and Albert's was on New Year's Eve. I wasn't very impressed. I know this place is listed as ""somewhat casual"" but it also tries to be upscale at the same time. We were dressed for going out on the town, other diners were dressed in old sweatpants. A little more casual than I thought! There were also a lot of children, babies, and families there for dinner. The lobster bisque was very bland and mine had no discernable lobster in it. The Filet was bland, unseasoned, and just ""ok"". The only redeeming quality of this experience was the truffle mac and cheese and our waiter was great. This place is probably best for a casual brunch or lunch; mainly caters to hotel guests and not locals. ",3
" Just by virtue of being a part of the historic Arizona Biltmore property, this restaurant deserves a visit. They offered some creative, tasty, orginal ""home-cooking"" options. Sweet potatoes fries were limp, but otherwise, very decent repast. ",4
 We highly recommend the fish tacos which are made with a Mexican white fish. Some of the best fish tacos we've ever eatten. The cobb salad is also good but the kicker at the end of our meal was the made-to-order cookie. If you're a cookie fan you have to get this. It takes a bit longer as they make the cookie as you wait but it is worth it! One of the better lunch experiences we've had in a long time. Enjoy! ,5
" The food had no taste. The chicken lollipops were said to have chipolte catsup, they were very bland. Also, the mac and cheese has no flavor. I tasted rue and noodle, no cheese. I expected more for being at the Biltmore. ",2
" We had a wonderful Christmas Day lunch at Frank and Albert's. Excellent service and food, even holiday music to add to the ambiance! Thank you for being open on the 25th. of December. There were quite a few folks dining @ F and A's that afternoon, so we thank you! Happy New Year! ",5
 The food was horrible! Even the macaroni and cheese had no taste! Fried chicken is never just a boneless chicken breast. Fried chicken is always on the bone. There was nothing comforting about this comfort food! ,2
" The overall dining experience, including the food, was very good. I rated the noise level as ""energetic"" but that would not be the accurate word to use if I did not have to make a slection from the list provided. I would have said it was way ""too noisy"" for two people to have a decent conversation. The music was not appropriate for fine dining and the accoustics of the room echoed and revirberated the high noise level of the two large groups (in the room with the fire pit). If it were not for such a distraction I would have had a much better dining experience. ",4
" Mediocre. Small portions, server was lacking in knowledge, personality and attentiveness. ",2
" Frank &amp; Albert's is the newest restaurant at the Arizona Biltmore. The menu features some comfort foods as well as other interesting dishes. I've eaten there several times and have enjoyed each meal. The Biltmore has excellent service. While it can be a bit pricey, it is a very enjoyable meal. The desserts - cookie, baked brownie are delicious. The poached duck fat french fries are also quite good. We enjoyed sitting by the indoor fireplace in the sun room. ",4
 We enjoyed a very nice evening at this restaurant.  The food and sevice were both very good and the decor is lovely. ,4
 We were seated next to one of several huge fireplac ,5
 music was better at Thanksgiving - not so jumpity - it should stay more relaxed and refined ,4
" The food, venue and service were all good. The music was too loud and thumpy. That may be what you call energetic - but it is really distracting for a nice meal experience. ",4
 I ordered the fish tacos and was disappointed. I've never had fish tacos where all the stuff was in the shell except the fish. The shell was filled to the max and made it difficult to figure out how to add the fish without taking everything out of the shell. I ended up eating the fish separate. So much for having fish tacos. ,3
" This is a very beautiful modern design and very tastefully done as you would expect from the Biltmore. We ate on the covered patio and it was very nice. More of a sun room with big sliding doors/windows. The lunch was very nice and a good portion size. We finished lunch off with Cherries Jubilee that was big enough for two. Mmmmm. I highly recommend this restaurant for business, casual or romantic meals. ",5
 Lovely new restaurant with decent food. Service needs a lot of work as everyone seems very inexperienced. ,3
" This was our first time at Frank and Alberts. We found it to be an enjoyable experience. The service was wonderful, the ambiance nice (we sat inside, but the outside was full of firepits and seemed like a great environment). Would recommend. ",4
" The tortilla soup is the only soup on their menu and for good reason. It's uh-maz-ing. We had the braised short ribs for dinner which was the special. The meat was so tender and everything it was served with was absolutely delectable. If this meal is available, choose it without hesitation. The crew is wonderful and you can tell they have been there a long time which also says a lot about the venue itself. ",5
 Fun and lively place to bring the family for a delicious breakfast.  Friendly and prompt service. ,5
 Our family has eaten here many times and we always have great service and love the ambiance. ,5
 This was the BEST meal I have ever had.  It was fantastic.  I will go back again and again. ,5
 We enjoyed the breakfast buffet. The food was good. ,5
" If you ever get the chance to attend a beer dinner, you must. Just amazing food, drink and company. ",5
" This was a last minute brunch decision and wow am I glad I went with this. Not busy (especially for the day) and a lovely open floor plan. The brunch buffet was simple but the quality was excellent, and the baked goods alone were worth the price. Our waitstaff was attentive but not hovering. The only downside is the open kitchen facing the dining room -  makes if very noisy. At the right time of year Im sure the outside dining would be fabulous. (It was too windy when we went) ",5
 They have recently changed chefs and the food is not the same. The additional items that have been added to the menu are marginal. ,2
" Hotel restaurants usually is more convenient than good but Frank and Albert is an exception. It is located inside the Arizona Biltmore Hotel in Phoenix. The food was so good that we ate there every night during our stay. They are pet friendly and one night, the patio was closed due to high wind and they let our dog sit in the sunroom with us. The shepherd pie was delicious and the Waldorf salad was exemplary. ",5
" Don't expect too much. While it has it has a very nice environment, off the lobby of the Arizona Biltmore, the quality of the food is just so-so. The prices are just about 180%  of what you would pay on the outside, for a similar quantity and quality of food. For example, a $26 meatloaf or a $22 hamburger. Throughly lackluster. ",2
" We love the Biltmore, but this luncheon was a bit disappointing.  Our waitress was just hired a month ago and she said she had two large groups given to her.  The bread we ordered, along with my coffee, never did make it to the table during lunch.  As we were leaving, someone brought it out and gave everyone a slice of the bread to take home.  We will go back, but thought the service this time was definitely not up to their usual higher standards. ",3
 steak was superb!  served on a steaming hot plate with perfect seasoning.  chocolate dessert was best torte I've ever had. ,5
" We stopped in for dinner after enjoying the view from the porch at the Biltmore patio.  Our experience was fantastic.  Food was phenomenal, from the short ribs to the shepards pie.  Service was excellent and waitstaff was friendly and helpful.  I highly recommend Frank and Alberts! ",5
" I get restaurants in large corporate resorts.  In college I worked as a waiter at one.   Management isn't their strength, though they have many layers of it; they focus on corporate bureaucracy not the diner experience; they rely on their in house guests to fill the seats.   So there are many little things overlooked.  Why is there only one hostess seating the long line of guests at busy times?  Why do food runners regularly deliver wrong items?  All that said, there are occasionally waiters who emerge through the blandness and provide a human touch.  This is a beautiful restaurant and one of my favorite outdoor places in Central Phoenix.  I'm content to just experience that albeit with lowered expectations...and the occasional hope that one day their waiters will run F&amp;A. ",3
" lunch on the patio was lovely.  quiet, beautiful surroundings.  good service. conducive to  visiting with guests.  our southwestern salads were excellent as was the  tortilla soup.  reasonably priced menu. ",4
" We always make a special trip to enjoy lunch at the Biltmore when we are in Tucson. The menu offers varied choices, the service is impeccable. We leave with good memories. ",4
 The best Tortilla soup ever and good wine. Very nice experience ,5
" We had a nice dinner.  Nothing spectacular.  Only one meat item on the entire menu so if you want steak...you are out of luck.  Were accommodating to my gluten and onion allergies but when my husband asked for fries in place of garlic mashed potatoes, we had to ask the waiter more than once.  everyone enjoyed the dinner but agreed it is a casual place and not exciting for a special occasion.   The waiter never returned to the table to check if all was OK after any course was served. ",4
" The beer dinners here are fantastic. The food is expertly done, and superbly paired with outstanding beer. The beer comes from both National and regional craft brewers. The creativity fits the location, and the names of the establishment. And, the price is perfect for a night to meet others that share a passion for food and craft beer. ",5
 Outstanding food and service in a unique outdoor setting.  It's worth a try just to see dramatic Frank Lloyd Wright influenced design of the Biltmore and the restaurant. ,5
 The server was amazing!  Everything was excellent! ,5
" Sat outdoors and it was very nice.  Good menu selection and service was prompt and courteous. I ordered the Shepherd's Pie which was ""cheese and potato glop"" essentially on top of a hamburger.  I picked at my dinner - wasn't the most appetizingly served. Very few carrots and peas which are in a Shepherd's Pie.  But their house tortilla soup was very good, although a bit watery.  I skipped dessert. ",4
 Elizabeth was excellent! ,5
" This restaurant will bring you back in time, to your childhood if you are a babyboomer ! The food is very good, but the Frank Lloyd Wright environment makes the difference. The noise nevel is low, a Wright place for a conversation. Follow up the next day with a visit of Taliesin West. ",4
" We've been here as a couple, as an extended family, and have brought groups from work for lunch and dinner.  This restaurant has never failed us!  The food and drinks are always good, and you get to bring out of towners to a beautiful setting like The Biltmore for quite reasonable prices. ",5
" An amazing location.  Everything was perfect from cocktails on the outdoor lawn to 'Smores for dessert.  Our waiter was fun, friendly and paced our apps, salads and entrees just right. I think there's more value here than in their higher priced venue, Wrights, where in my humble opinion, the prices are too high, the food no better, and the portions smaller.  Just tellin it like it is! ",5
 We Really enjoyed the experience.  We had dinner and it was warm enough for us to sit by the fire pits.  The service was exceptional - however the restaurant was not very busy due to our early dinner .   We would highly recommend it and will be back when we are visiting Phoenix again. ,5
" great patio dining, food was good. Service was very slow. ",3
 Kitchen is willing to make special requests. Server Krasimir was excellent. ,5
" Beautiful location, exceptional staff and food. Very reasonable when you consider the location. A must do whenever I am in town! ",5
" Service was very good, as was the food.  However, we thought the portions were very small...we had steak.  The meat portion was reasonable, but it was served with a dollop of potatoes, one stalk of broccoli and two tiny carrots. No value here. ",3
" Unfriendly and incompetent staff. Out of four meal one was excellent, one was fair, one was just OK and the fourth could not be eaten. Worst part was that the waiter had no knowledge of beer available, no opinion on food and certainly had no idea how to serve, nor how or when to clean a table. Untouched food did not elicit a question from him.  The restaurant was empty, no wonder. It did not help that the restaurant has no atmosphere and that tables and seating are uncomfortable. With few exception, at every table one or two guest's will bump their elbows against a wall. For a recently refurbished facility, a very poor design. Management is invisible, no doubt contributing to the sloppiness and quality of food and service. None of the four of us, will return to this poorly operated hotel and restaurant. ",5
" Went for breakfast/brunch the day after christmas and the restaurant was busy...glad I had a reservation. Service was slow, but the food was excellent and when it came was hot. The waitress repeatedly apologized for the slow service. Have eatwn here many times and would recommend! ",4
" My son and I dined at Frank &amp; Albert's and enjoyed most especially their chicken tortilla soup. My meatloaf, a specialty, was very good and a generous portion.  It was accompanied by very creamy whipped potatoes and spinach.  My son finished with their coconut creme pie. ",5
" We were at Frank and Albert's on Christmas day. We opted for the buffet @$60 per person. Although they had a nice selection, the food was warm - not hot and the salmon, although tasty, was dry.  The dessert selection was excellent, the pastry chef  was there and very proud of her work.(rightfully so) Our server was attentive. However, the overall feel of the place was rather casual. For $60 a person I would have liked to have had a nicer setting. I had expected more from a restaurant at the Biltmore. ",3
 We thoroughly enjoyed our lunch.....the service was impeccable!!! ,5
" Disclaimer: The resort lobby and common areas are undergoing major remodeling that caused a black out.  Defer a visit until construction is complete.  We would have preferred being informed of the 'inconvenience' that may be caused by the extensive construction when we made the reservation for 6!  We were disappointed  because we expected the renowned ""resort"" lobby to be decorated for Christmas!  As for Dinner: What could have been a disaster wasn't. We enjoyed the mood lighting provided by the red glowing emergency lights and think the decor was more appealing because of it.   We made a point to thank the chefs for cooking by flashlight. Our meals were very good, nicely presented, proportioned and looked great.  The shepherd's pie is full of tender meat and very hearty. The blackened salmon was enhanced with black beans. The short ribs were so tender and had no fat. Scallops are seared, plump and juicy. The waitress appreciated our good humor so much that they poured us another round of Spirits. Ending the night inhaling the fragrant aroma of strong decaf coffee and sharing desert topped the night. ",3
 The food was wonderful. I had the salmon and it was cooked perfectly. My husband and I were sharing the caprese and it came split in two plates which was very nice as we did not ask for this to be done. The ambiance was nice but the server was inattentive. After 20 minutes seated we asked a hostess if we could order a drink and the server overheard this and ran right over. She was working on the computer 10 feet away but we couldn't get her attention until we got someone else's. It was 45 minutes before the wine was recieved. We weren't in a hurry but we're so aggravated about the lack of attention during a slow period that it prevents us from going back. The food was memorable but not enough. ,3
 We had a lovely Thanksgiving dinner at Frank &amp; Albert's at the Arizona Biltmore.  The staff was gracious and friendly and honored our request for a booth.  We loved the Waldorf Salad which was a perfect starter and its nice to know its on the regular menu so we can order it again!  The buffet had 4 great options including a delicious salmon en croute with truffles.  The dessert buffet was absolutely spectacular and we loved everyone of the - at least five - desserts that we tried!  Well done everyone! ,5
" My husband and I attended the Phoenix Auto Show at the downtown Convention Center and decided to have Thanksgiving dinner at Frank &amp; Albert's this year...not only because it was conveniently located to the show, but because we've dined there numerous times and we knew it would be a great experience.  Even though we live at the opposite end of the city, the drive (about 50+ miles) was truly worth it.  Frank &amp; Albert's always gets ""thumbs up"" from us, and we can't wait to go back again! ",5
 Service was poor. ,3
 I've been here several times and really think their breakfast is the best option. The dinner menu is pretty uninspiring. Despite that it well nicely cooked and presented. I'd go again but probably not for dinner. ,3
 Loved this place. Stayed at the hotel for a wedding and it was super yummy to have so close by. ,5
 We went for an early holiday lunch. Wait staff was so kind to my 88 year old mother and her 92 year old friend. The Biltmore looks so beautiful for the holidays. Food was very good and well priced for what you got. ,5
" It is a lovely venue, but the food does not live up to it.  It took 30 minutes to get our drink order.  Soup was cold and salads were bland. ",3
" We had a late night dinner upon arrival at the Arizona Biltmore.  Hostess was extremely friendly, as was the wait staff.  We were seated in a quiet area right next to a beautiful fireplace.  Dress was very casual (dressy jeans/pants). The hotel was not busy, so our meal was leisurely and quiet, which was very appreciated after a long day of travel.  Dinner started with an appetizer, ""Smashed avocado"" which was yummy, entrees of Salmon and Free Range chicken were excellent, filling but not heavy.  Wine servings were HUGE and very tasty.  All in all, would highly recommend for a peaceful meal in an absolute beautiful setting at the Arizona Biltmore!! ",4
" The meal, service, decor, outdoor fire places made the graduation celebration one to remember! ",5
 Loved our server! Brigetta...sp? ,5
 Very good food quality and selection. ,4
" Waited for weather to cool off so we could enjoy the outdoor dining patio in the evening and sit by the fireplace. I enjoy the ambience of the Arizona Biltmore and the Frank Llloyd Wright influences, and am grateful for the ability to have a conversation with my dinner partner and not have to fight loud music at all. The food was excellent. The Branzini (Sea Bass) Special was outstanding. Our waiter was very attentive and pleasant. All in all, a very pleasant evening to celebrate a special occasion. ",4
 Poor menu. Very few choices. ,1
 Fantastic dinner for my Wife's Birthday!  FOOD WAS EXCELLENT. The staff went out of their way to prepare a special complimentary birthday treat for my wife. ,5
" Frank and Albert's has a casual elegance to it without the high price. The outdoor patio areas are wonderful and the fire pits and fire place are warm and comforting. The service could have been a little better about refilling non-alcoholic beverages (water/coffee). Thus the Good instead of Very Good overall rating. The food was a very good value, beautifully displayed and tasted delicious too. ",3
 The hotel and restaurant architecture was stunning. The food was ok but don't sit outside. The birds are used to being feed and they crawl all over the place including the tables.  Had to duck more than once as they flew by. ,3
 Wow! Our best dining experience of our 10 day trip. Our waitress made the evening special making us feel important and special!!! She was fun and helpful. The food was excellent and the outdoor dining setup was awesome. We will be back!!! ,5
" You would expect 7 PM on a slow weeknight a restaurant of this caliber would have prompt timely friendly service.  Alas it was five minutes before we were acknowledged  at the table and every step of the way it seemed like the waiter was too busy elsewhere to attend to our needs. From taking our order to bringing wonderful bread even picking up the check after we placed our credit cards on the leather folder there were long delays. But when he was there, he was friendly.   Having said that, the salads were scrumptious, chicken was moist and flavorful, the salmon was perfectly prepared and it was a most tasty experience ",3
" Three of us ordered the chicken salad with buttermilk dressing and we honestly thought it was the best salad we have had, maybe ever!  The other two ordered the spinach salad and did not like it at all.  All in all, though, a very nice experience. ",4
 We sat out side since the weather has been cooling off. We were there early and were the only ones seated outside for about an hour. The food was good and the service was great. Can't beat the Biltmore for ambience. ,5
" Our photography group tour stopped by to see and admire the art decor, the lunch was an added bonus! The staff had no problem seating our 35+ group. Service was fast, and friendly. Our waitress kept topping off our drinks, we were very thirsty!! ",4
 Fabulous service and ambience! ,5
" Nice, relaxing atmosphere.  They have a nice, diverse menu so everyone in your party should find something of interest.  I tried the meatloaf and it was delicious.  The service was excellent as well.  I would definitely recommend! ",5
 Best tortilla soup ever! ,5
 Food was surprisingly sub-par.  Had two meals there.  Lunch was overcooked.  Breakfast upset my stomach.  Not normal for a five star resort. ,2
" Waiter, Guy, was excellent: very knowledgeable; food was excellent as well. The open room tended to get noisier as the night progressed.   All in all, a good experience was had by all. ",2
" The food was good.   Our server was very apologetic, however, delivered the wrong order.  this not only delayed our dinner after a long day, it made for an uncomfortable setting.   We used this restaurant again the next night strictly due to the limited on campus choices that are available at this venue. ",3
 Wonderful service. Milenko was our outstanding server. ,5
 It was a nice option on property for dining with Wrights being closed during the holiday weekend. The staff was very attentive and friendly despite being very busy. ,3
" Great food and service.  New menu was provided but includes a variety that can satisfy every taste.  The environment is relaxing and since e We were on the special Staycations Package and we decided to eat at Frank and Alberts bar, casual restaurant and the glass patio with the fireplace.  All great areas and each a very pleasant environment.  This is our third stay at the resort on this special package and will certainly not be our last. ",5
" Wonderful, creative meals in a modern take on the architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright. The best way to enjoy their creativity is to attend one of the monthly beer dinners. They are simply amazing, creative mixes for food, beer, staff, and patrons.  I am really happy to have suggested that Firestone Walker to be a part of the series next month. ",5
 I brought 3 friends from Washington.  They loved the history and beautiful architect of the Biltmore.  The food was absolutely wonderful and so was the service.  We will be back ,5
 Im a bit surprised being that its the Biltmore I thought they would be a little more selective with hiring staff. Our waiter seemed annoyed at everything and had no personality whatsoever. ,3
" Very disappointed. Website posts Happy Hour Menu so booked party of 8. Upon being seated the waiter told us they were ""making changes"" and they no longer offer Happy Hour. ",2
" We brought a group of customers for dinner while in town and had a fantastic meal. Food was great, service was exceptional and the overall experience was awesome. Our customers were very impressed. We recommended to a couple others while here for the conference. ",5
" Usually very attentive and fast service; however this time it took about 35 minutes after ordering for our food to get to the table. The food was good when it arrived, although my daughter's hamburger bun was burnt. Management was accommodating and we will give them another shot. ",3
 I loved the food. The steak was perfectly cooked and the bartender made an amazing vesper martini. Ill be back again. Thanks for an awesome bar experience ,5
" Frank &amp; Albert's is the perfect place for brunch at almost half the price of the more formal Wrights, but the same great food. This is an annual tradition for a friend's birthday with mimosas flowing, awesome bloody mary's and your choice of the big buffet or individual meals. The eggs benedict? To die for. The pastries? Couldn't get enough chocolate croissants. And don't get me started on the pancakes. Despite a pretty rowdy party of 12, our server Zach was cool as a cucumber, never missing a beat and going beyond the call of duty.  You can't beat the ambience, AZ Biltmore never ceases to impress, whether it's your first or 100th visit. Go! Seriously, go now! ",5
" Excellent, attentive staff, but not overly and bothersome. Foot was outstanding and portions just right. Friendly place all around. ",5
 Food worthy of an assisted living facility.  Don’t go here if you still have the teeth you were born with. ,2
" Great food, service was amazing. It’s definitely a place I’ll be dining in again. ",5
 The lobster ravioli were light.  Salad was fresh.  Prices were reasonable ,4
 First time at this restaurant. One of the first things the waiter said to us was are we going to the theater. As a matter of fact we were and so very pleased that he thought to ask so that there was time to finish our meal comfortably. The waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu items and service was excellent. The food was very good but more impressed with the excellent value. The patrons seemed to be a mixture of local regulars and the pre-theater types. I would recommend. ,4
 We enjoyed our Tapas in the lounge. We always enjoy our visit to Alexis ,5
 We always enjoy our time there! Delicious food! They cater to dietary needs. The staff is friendly. ,5
" We were celebrating our wedding anniversary. This was our first time at this restaurant. Although  It was a 35 minute drive from North Scottsdale, I would make it our business to return to this wonderful restaurant. The service was excellent, food and presentation was outstanding, and  very reasonable prices. Definitely the best value we have found in the valley for the quality of the meal. They also brought us 2 amazing desserts on the house. I’m sure it will be a regular  destination and make sure to order the veal chop. ",5
" Fabulous Food, great service and reasonable pricing make this restaurant a definate come back again place.  Came early for our reservation and were seated after just a short wait.  Nice that the tables are not crowded together.  Great coffee and dessert made the evening perfect. ",5
" Been there many times, usually lunch, but Saturday nights dinner was wonderful. Had nice table by the window, and Thomas our server was just great. BruceV ",4
 No surprises.  Just as good as always!  Had the roast duck a l'orange.  It was perfect -- nice and crispy without being dried out.  Split the Caesar salad.  It is quite sufficient for two. ,4
 Took my family and out of town visitor to dinner at Alexi's Grill.  It was the first time for my invited guests and they were all awed at the food and friendliness of the staff.  Even the owner stopped by to greet all of us.  Very impressive! ,5
" The food was solid, but the service was extremely poor. We both had chicken dishes and they had good flavor, the dinner salad was also surprisingly good. Prices are very reasonable! Our server was inattentive and dismissive although he was able answer some questions about gluten free options. The outdoor area was cute, we were unable to sit outside because of a large party. ",3
 Food was great! ,4
 The service was superb. The food was very tasty. A very enjoyable evening. ,5
" Everyone was pleasant, but our waiter was stiff and had no recommendations. ",4
" Met my  granddaughter and great grandson (2 yrs) here for late lunch.  Business  workers were finishing up their lunch and leaving.  Restaurant was quiet, so good for conversation.  Waiter was prompt and unobtrusive so that was a plus.  Water on rocks outside the entrance was a very pleasing visual. Owner was attentive and friendly. ",4
" As always, Alexi's Grill is a a dining pleasure. The food is always delicious — the gyros are amazing — and the staff is at the top of their game. I highly recommend this restaurant for business luncheons. ",5
 It was our first time there and we loved it!! ,5
 The menu for New Years Eve was extensive.  Food was very good and the service was excellent. ,4
" Alexi's is our favorite restaurant for special occasions and pre-theatre dinners.  It has a great atmosphere and is good for quiet conversation.  The food is outstanding and the menu is very diverse.  This evening, my daughter and I enjoyed the poached salmon and my husband had the very tasty lamb shank. ",5
" A New Year's Eve special is Duck with Orange Sauce (or Peppercorn Sauce).  The Duck was outstanding! Perfectly seasoned and cooked, tender and moist with a crisp skin.  The1  only minor drawback was the vegetable trio - the broccoli was tough and under cooked while the glazed carrots, while very tasty, were overcooked and almost mushy.  Our guests enjoyed a lovely rack of lamb and a beautiful salmon entree.  The service was excellent and the decor lovely for New Year's Eve. ",5
 It is a nice Italian restaurant like you would find in Eastern cities like South Philly. ,5
 Always great food and great service! A midtown Phoenix gem. ,5
" Service was good, very attentive. ",5
" We could not have asked for a nicer meal on Christmas Eve. The food was superb, the service was friendly and the noise level was so low we could hear each other!  It was truly a beautiful evening. ",5
 This is the second time we've been to Alexi's for dinner.  GREAT place.  Excellent food and service.  Fun atmosphere. ,5
 Very nice place for a good meal at a reasonable price. ,5
" What a pleasant find! Such good and interesting food, served in a casual, but comfortable and specialized atmosphere. Everything was great. The black and white attire of the staff was a real plus too. We will be back! ",5
" We took our daughter here for her birthday on her lunch break. We were a little short on time but the food came quickly and the server was always available. I had the Greek salad with the salmon. So nice to see a full salad with all the trimmings, big chunks of feta cheese, and a nice sized slab of salmon on top! The meal was wonderful - and reasonable in cost. An excellent meal!! ",5
 Because of the traffic we were late for our reservation and had to be out in time to get to Symphony. Alexi’s grill manage to do everything on time with delicious food and not feeling rushed. I have never Had a disappointing meal there. ,5
" We were there for business lunch.  It was a busy day and our server was a bit running around.  But, the food I ordered was grilled and it was done perfectly.  Main dish came with a salad; not fancy but was fresh.   Overall, this restaurant provides pleasant ambience and tasty food. ",4
 Very professional experienced waiters make this restaurant a special experience ,4
" We were first-time diners here. With all the great recommendations and high star ratings, we expected to be wowed. Unfortunately, we were massively disappointed.  Things started well with friendly greetings from both the hostess and our server. We placed our orders. The side salads arrived: crisp, chilled lettuce, well dressed. Sadly, things went downhill from there. The fettuccine Alfredo with chicken looked like soup because the wildly over salted sauce was much too thin to adhere to the pasta. The trout almandine - not great, but acceptable - was accompanied by cold vegetables: potatoes, undercooked, woody broccoli and sweet carrots. The choice of the latter to accompany the butter/lemon  fish was baffling.  Underwhelmed by the mains, we did not sample dessert. ",2
 This was the first time since I have been going to Alexis that the service was terrible. Thank goodness the food more than made up for it and the manager came over and apologized.  The Athenian Halibut is always a great choice when the fish is fresh and in season.  I have never had a bad experience at Alexis  and always look forward to dining there. ,4
 It is always a treat to dine here.  The food is always delicious! ,5
 There aren't really any choices if you are there for a conference. Service was great. Food is overpriced and mediocre. Atmosphere is terrific.   Really no reason for them not to cook delicious food. ,4
 Very average food and service. Nice outdoor setting. Not worth a second try. ,3
 Service was excellent. ,4
" We've been going to this restaurant twice a year since it opened. We love the decor of the interior and the patio. Last night, however, was a major disappointment. We were a party of six and our table was so close to the hedge that I had to bend back to branches to get to my seat and fuss either throughout the meal. We had to request bread twice--the waiter said that it came from the Wildflower bakery and that portions were limited. (Wildflower is popular throughout the Valley with many locations, so I don't understand the scarcity other than economics). I ordered the ""signature "" meat loaf but was disappointed that the meatloaf was rather dry and smothered in a BBQ style sauce. My wife's Mac and cheese side was similarly dry. Shame on us, we should have sent them back to the kitchen. This restaurant has pleased us in the past and we will be more exigent in the future ",2
 The tortilla soup was absolutely outstanding!  Understandable signature dish. ,4
" What a wonderful evening! A gorgeous setting at the Arizona Biltmore with outstanding food and excellent service. If you are thinking of going to Wrights, go to Frank and Alberts instead. Terrific menu, beautiful outdoor dining and much better prices. One of the most memorable restaurants I have been to. Would return in a split second. ",5
 superb food! best scallops and pork chops I've ever had! the atmosphere was upscale-relaxed and quiet enough for conversation. i will definitely recommend it! ,5
" Service was lacking. We were the only people in our area and still the wait staff had major problems taking care of us including getting us simple requests like refills on water and iced tea. Thankfully a food runner was around to bring our food to us that was sitting in the kitchen window for 10 minutes since our server was no where to be seen.   Beautiful space,  but the restaurant couldn't care less about a customer. ",2
 Outdoor ambiance. Great setting. Nicer outside but attractive inside.  Good food. ,4
" We were looking for a casual dining experience with wonderful food, and that is exactly what we received.  We each ordered different appetizers and entrees, and all were delicious.  We enjoyed dining on the patio and had a great waitress! ",5
" Wonderful ambiance on outdoor patio,  excellent pizza, great service ",5
" Lovely breakfast buffet and wonderful menu selections. Not as glamorous as the main dining room buffet. But all come from the same excellent kitchen. Have brunch, then walk guests around to see this architectural gem. ",5
" Waiter got our drink order wrong twice, food was fair, if we weren't so hungry by the time the food came we would not have eaten it. ",2
 Got the House Fries as an appetizer but for eleven dollars all we got was a three inch by three inch basket of fries! Not even as much as a small order from Culvers!!! Very disappointed. Overpriced. ,2
 Excellent grilled cheese and tomato soup albeit a bit pricey. ,4
" Nice place, good food &amp; we got great service, better than Chart House or Ruth Chris. Made smores at table to complete experience. ",4
 Outdoor seating area is wonderful especially when the weather cooperates. Fire pits scattered around the patio area. Surprisingly good pizza. Breakfast buffet not cheap but high quality. ,5
 Had  a very nice lunch here with friends while I was staying at the resort.  The service was better on this visit than I've experienced before.  Our waitress had a great sense of humor and personality. ,3
 Food and service was excellent!!  My husband and I had the smashed avocado as an appetizer and the pizza for dinner.  Very good pizza!!  Would come here again!! ,5
" Frank and Albert just wasn't up to par with other ""resort"" and specialty restaurants.  My rib eye for $38 was fatty, grizzly and comparable to the $8 steak at Applebees. The meatloaf was incredibly good, juicy and a very good portion size. The tortilla soup was excellent. The salad was ok with it's best feature lots of moist chicken and toppings. I would have ordered the scallops but at $40 for 3 sea scallops on a bed of fero, no. With all the great places to enjoy a meal, this wouldn't be my 1st choice. This was a sad experience because we've eaten here a dozen times before. ",3
" It was surprisingly bad.   Maybe the worst pizza I've had besides Pizza Hut, and it had been under a heat lamp for a long time and the sauce had that old tired look to it. My wife's pasta was bland.  The guacamole was average.     We've been to Wright's for brunch,  and it was fabulous, but this restaurant needs a lot of work and is a terrible value. ",2
 Our food was served very quickly- before our drinks. It was not much of a dining experience. Pretty disappointing for the price. ,3
 It was a perfect follow-up to our tour of Taliesin West. ,5
 Service was excellent and the food outstanding. I had the brussel sprouts salad with added chicken which was cooked perfectly. The dressing was delicious with an olive oil and apple cider vinegar base. ,5
" Lunch at the AZ Biltmore has always been a special treat, but most recent visit was not up to par. Despite having made reservations, we were seated in direct sun. Other tables outdoors in shade appeared available but we were told we couldn't be seated there. Drinks were brought with no napkin or coaster, awkward to dismantle the heavy garnish on our Bloody Mary in order to drink it. Had to put them on the placemat. Service was friendly but slow. We had to ask for utensils and napkins. Our salads and sandwiches were ok. Large noisy birds descended on tables to scavenge leftovers. That can't be sanitary? The  hotel is stunning but I will think twice before returning to this restaurant. ",3
" Casual and quiet.  We ate on the patio and on a Monday night, it was not crowded.  We sat near a fireplace as the evening was cool but there were plenty of overhead heaters too.  Great service.  Good food.  Would dine again if staying at the Biltmore. ",4
 Food was good although not very hot. Service was friendly but not intrusive. ,4
" Our first time there and it not be the last. Service, menu, food location and drinks were all excellent! ",5
" An outstanding place to have breakfast, lunch or dinner. I spent three days at the Biltmore, and ate all of my meals at Frank &amp; Albert's by choice, it was that good. The food and the cocktails were outstanding, I didn't have one bad thing the entire time. The chopped salads were delicious, and if you're even remotely a cocktail fan, don't miss ""The Ricky"" which to me sums up the resort perfectly in one glass. Cheers! ",5
 Every January I visit the Arizona Biltmore where I Dine at Frank and Alberts. Every year I find a new menu with new treats. My server was charming and efficient. Highly recommend. ,5
" We were on our way to downtown Phoenix on New Year's Eve day. Stopped in for lunch at 2:15 in the afternoon. Restaurants were not open at that time, but being part of a hotel, we knew frank and albert's would be. We usually eat there for dinner and were always happy with the experience. The food and service were good. The one thing that seemed unreasonable was the 11.00 order of French fries!! They were good, but there were not many of them so they came out to be like 50 cents a fry! ",4
" We dined at Frank &amp; Albert's during our holiday stay at the Biltmore. The highlight was the staff. They were all friendly, helpful, and eager to please. The big disappointment was the decor. The restaurant is one of only two restaurants on the property, a beautifully restored and updated Frank Lloyd Wright architectural masterpiece. In contrast to the rest of the property, Frank &amp; Albert's looks like a slightly upscale version of Denny's that has seen better days.  In the morning, there's plenty of wonderful Arizona light coming in the huge windows, making it a better choice for brunch. ",4
" It was a very nice experience.  Somewhat more casual than we expected.... Frank &amp; Albert's definitely has the ""Wright look"", but is more upscale diner than fine-dining.  Christmas buffet was good but not memorable....the dessert array WAS remarkable!  Service good.  We enjoyed.  Of course Biltmore was gorgeously dressed for holiday and lobby filled with happy guests. ",4
 Amazing service!  You get whatever you ask for Delicious food :) ,5
 Very pleasant atmosphere. Located in the fabulous historical  Biltmore Hotel. Walk around to see incredible architecture where the stars and the past presidents have stayed.  We came for Christmas day dinner but have visited many times and will be back again. ,4
" Casual dining in the midst of historic elegance...our ""go to"" spot for comfortable and charming ambience. ",5
 The menu was NOT what OpenTable posted. It was very limited and not very good. We will not go back. ,3
 We had the sweetest of wait staff serve us and each of us enjoyed our meals. Tres leches dessert was divine. ,4
" WE had a wonderful experience at Frank and Albert's, eating breakfast, lunch, and dinner there with our Biltmore all inclusive package.  All meals were well presented with wonderful flavors.  We will definitely go again.  Our waiter twice, Zach, was excellent! ",5
 The food and the service were equally top notch. The noise level in the room was extreme making a cross table conversation challenging. ,4
" I was not overly impressed by Frank &amp; Albert's.  There was nothing terrible about it, but it had been highly recommended to me by a colleague and really didn't deliver on that.  The menu was  actually fairly small and while the food was OK no one in our party was overly impressed either.  Being in the Biltmore it is in a very cool setting and can be worth a visit if you are staying in the area. ",3
 Great dining at the Biltmore!  We enjoyed our meal at Frank and Albert's. ,4
" Anniversary dinner was phenomenal, free glasses of champagne were given with excellent cocktails. Sea bass and salmon were excellent dinner choices. Tortilla soup is to die for, excellent taste. We were given complimentary dessert. ",5
 good food; large portions; good service--quiet location; good for business or sensitive meetings. ,4
 Alexi's never disappoints.  Food is always tasty and service is spot on.  They are very accommodating for theater-goers which we were that night. ,5
" A real gem. Fresh seafood, attentive service...always a great experience, and you never know who you might run into! ",5
 Alexi’s provided great food at a price about 25% below what I expect to pay at a white tablecloth restaurant. The calamari was an outstanding appetizer and everyone in my party enjoyed their meal. ,5
 We certainly love this place and the menu is perfect for a small selection of delicious items.   Their meatloaf is quite the popular item here!  The decor is perfect for a group of friends to gather and help celebrate an occasion.  The staff are friendly and very attentive! ,5
" This is one of our favorite restaurants. Expensive, but good food. ",5
 We were eight friends that got together for cocktails and small plates to share.  Loved the smoked salmon and shrimp and grits.  Great service and lively atmosphere. ,5
 The main draw to this restaurant is the baby back ribs which are excellent. Love the cook books available at each booth to pursue while waiting for dinner. Disappointed to find our food was rushed to the table practically on top of each other during restaurant week. Entrees got cold at our table while we tried to finish our appetizers and management didn't seem to notice or care. ,1
 Great Brussel sprouts!!  They are  must as an appetizer! ,5
 Went to celebrate a friends birthday we had appetizers and entres and drinks.  Everyone raved about the food and the service and the ambiance ,5
 My food was tasty and different. I went there because I wanted a good meal. ,5
 Was looking for a decent restaurant close to the airport to have a family friendly dinner before catching the red eye back to NY and this was just what we were looking for. Good food and good service. Don't skip the brownie dessert - it is worth it. ,5
" While this is not the finer dining establishment that I thought or that the hostess made it sound like, it was a nicer upscale sports bar with fancy sports bar cuisine.  The drinks were great as well as the appetizer.  The main courses, however, left much to be desired and for the cost were just not worth it.  I would return for appetizers and drinks but that's about it. ",4
 Great food and quick service! The tuna poké app was delicious. Try the shrimp and grits - you won't be disappointed! ,5
 The food was fresh and very tasty.  The service was excellent and the staff very pleasant and helpful.  Recommended by a friend in the Town and Country Center where Baby Kays used to be. ,5
 Braised short ribs. Excellent. ,4
" Fabulous place - we love it Great place, great location , servers patient ",5
 Love it! Was seated right away. The menu does not have a ton of options but it such good food it doesn't matter! ,5
 Excellent! Had the swordfish they had as special my niece too we both said best fish we've had in a long time! Service was great and had wonderful evening. ,5
 We were a party of six and everyone loved their entree as well as the two appetizers and desserts we ordered in celebration of a 54th wedding anniversary. Our group had a big age range and sometimes making everyone happy is tall order. Grassroots Kitchen did a great job. ,5
 I love Grassroots!  Food was excellent and we all had a great time! ,5
 Close and convenient.  First time in this restaurant.  The braised short ribs were very good (husband).  I had the portobella sandwich and I would not recommend it because it needed more mushrooms (the meat) to taste like I was eating a fulfilling sandwich not just focaccia bread .  Service was great! ,3
 Food is always delicious &amp; fresh! ,5
 Love this place and what's more they have a dog friendly patio. We'll be back! ,5
 I and my friends loved it.  The food was terrific.  I would prefer no playing of music. ,5
 Terrific food all the way around. ,5
" This was another visit to Grassroots. Been there multiple times, and have always come away thinking ""What a great restaurant.""  There were six of us, and can get a little noisy, but our server was attentive, very friendly, and just did a fabulous job.  Even brought us a couple of slices of pie for dessert. Very highly recommended.  You won't be disappointed. ",5
 The food and atmosphere was great. The menu seemed to have a lot of good items and drinks. The only problem was being rushed through dinner by our server. ,4
 Thanks Corinne! Always great service that keeps us coming back! ,5
" Well prepared cuisine. Fresh, quality ingredients with professional wait staff. Our redfish and trout were excellent. The Key Lime pie was first class. Our wait person Domingo made our visit memorable. ",4
" Did Not have the Happy hour product/Food advertised as key item ... service was good but disappointed that couldn't order  what took me there , Happy hour feature not available . Poor planning ! ",3
 interesting menu and located within walking distance of our hotel ,4
" Friendly staff and relaxed, casual setting. Cajun ahi sandwich and the brisket sandwich were filling and delicious! ",5
" Our group shared a couple shared plates plates; brussels sprouts (best ever had),  and the pork belly (excellent).  For my main course I had the salmon with miso glaze with the special veggie which was tri-colored cauliflower.  I would gladly have again.  Others had the Po' Boy, Short Ribs, and Tuna with salad. The desserts included key lime pie and coconut cream pies and the toffee brownie.  All hits.  We all want to return again soon.  Great food, service, ambiance! ",5
" I had eaten at Grassroots once before, and I brought a Foodie Dinner Group for this visit. Everyone LOVED their food (Ahi Tuna, Shrimp and Grits, Waldorf Salad entrees and Tuna Poke and Burrata appetizers). The waitress was wonderful and the food came out fast. The whole group said they plan to return! ",5
" the greeter was rude and would not accommodate us because we arrived 16 minutes late. She explained that after 15 minutes, the reservation was no longer valid. I am not sure if this is true or not. Either way, there were people who arrived at the same time as us WITHOUT a reservation, and she proceeded to be sit them before us. I asked her that given the fact that I had taken the time to make a reservation, wouldn't it be fair to sit us before the walk-in party? She ignored me and then sat other walk-ins. I was with the CEO of my company and this type of treatment was unfair and embarrassing. I would have understood if she was seating other folks who had reservations, but that was not the case. Although the food is good, it is not great and neither is the service. I will never go back there for a business lunch and would not recommend this place to others either. ",2
" Went to Grassroots for the first time for dinner and had a great experience.  The service was terrific, the food was great and the wine list was good/affordable.  The brisket, the salmon and the filet were our entree selections and they were all very good.  We had been enjoyed their happy hour before, but will definitely return for dinner. ",5
 Just love the food at Grassroots. Was excited to take my husband there since he hadn't been there yet. Thanks for great food and great service! ,5
" Met  colleague for lunch and when I gave a heads up to the server I needed to customize a salad with ingredients I found on their menu, he seemed a bit put off but when I relayed a very simple request he acknowledged 'oh that wasn't bad at all'.  Service overall was great and food was delicious, salad and fish portion was a bit small for the cost. ",4
 The salads were large and tasty with interesting combinations.  The  Ahia Tuna was rare and flavored wonderfully.  The ribs were thick and juicy and the steak was moist and prepared to perfection.  Staff was very accommodating and the manager checked on us to make sure that we were completely satisfied with our service and meals. ,5
 The manager came by to see how we were doing and when he learned this was our first time eating here he gave us a free dessert!!! ,4
" Had a great time. The service took a little longer than we would have liked (long delays with ordering the food, drinks empty for a while, long wait for the check). Other than that, it was fine! Everyone was happy with the grub and the ambiance was comfortable. ",4
 Nice place and good drinks but the menu was a little weird.... I wouldn't call myself a picky eater but I basically didn't see anything I would want I ended up going with a salad but had to ask for certain items left out ,3
" My third time here,grate atmosphere ,fantastic tasty food,pleasant service ,love it.Romantic dining,or family friendly .Enjoyed the patio dinning a lot,very clean.Will keep coming back. ",5
" Second time at Grassroots!  even better this time!  quality food, quality combinations and reasonably priced for the great quality.  I strong THUMBS UP! ",5
" everything was great, especially the shrimp + grits, and the ribs! wow those were good. also the pork belly, but really, everything was great. ",4
 Two out of five meals were not prepared properly and it took a long time to correct. Everyone was done eating by the time the meals were redone. They were more concerned about bigger parties. Not a place I’d go again. Very disappointing way to end a business meeting. ,2
" My spouse and I enjoyed a meal on a Sunday evening at this restaurant.  We were seated at a small table by the large windows.  It was after sunset and the views of the city to the north were very pleasant. We enjoyed our meals, artfully presented and tasteful.  Our waiter was pleasant and very accommodating to our preferences, as well as knowledgeable on the wines that were offered.  We recommend this restaurant for its unique views, style and cuisine. ",5
" Been here several times over the last few years. Great location and usually above average food. We both had the filet this time, which was seasoned with too much salt. We did not comment to our server as we have learned that sending meals back really ruins our evening.  The meat cuts were not the quality expected. We get better cuts at Whole Foods.  We will likely not return for the value. ",4
" Food was marginal, halibut was undercooked  the view was great, the architecture of the space is cool ",2
" Overall I was very unsatisfied; although the views are spectacular , the portion sizes were extremely small and the food quality was poor. On a 6 person  table, no order was cooked to the desired temp. Soup was salty,  ect...$500.00 and I had to make a snack at home because I was still hungry....would not go back. ",2
" Beautiful view,but the $44 ribeye was tough, appetizer cold, patio heater didn’t work.  Not a good value. ",2
" Top of the Rock is a real treat in Phoenix. It has absolutely stunning views and is a sanctuary in the desert in the city! Just entering the grounds makes you take a deep breath and appreciate the true beauty of the Southwest. The food was fantastic, too!!! It is definitely a perfect spot for a special occasion! ",4
" Server was great, wish I could remember her name. Nysa?? ",5
" BEAUTIFUL VIEWS OVERLOOKING THE VALLEY AND DELICIOUS MENU SELECTION. WE HAD THE LOBSTER RAVIOLI, THE HALIBUT, THE CHICKEN AND THE DUCK AND ALL WERE PERFECTLY PREPARED AND PRESENTED. OUR SERVER WAS ACCOMMODATING AND FRIENDLY.  THE PRICES ARE A BIT STEEP - AND WHEN WE ASKED FOR A DECENT ""POUR"" ON A SECOND SCOTCH, WE GOT UPCHARGED. GIVEN WHAT WE WERE PAYING FOR THE REST OF THE MEAL, THAT SHOULD HAVE JUST BEEN GIVEN FOR FREE. ",3
 Celebrated wife's birthday here.  The view is spectacular but that is about it.  Food was not worth the price. I got the rib eye and wife got the filet mignon. Have had better steaks at a much cheaper spot. ,3
" Made a reservation through OpenTable &amp; our table was next to the window, best view! Excellent &amp; unique food! Very quick service. The thought of ""when will the food arrive?"" never crossed our minds. We were very pleased with the flow of how our food arrived. The chicken donuts were amazing &amp; perfect spicy kick, highly recommend this appetizer! Plus, the bread basket after our appetizer &amp; before our main course was an excellent touch! My boyfriend &amp; I were celebrating our 7th Anniversary, &amp; our waiter paid for our dessert as a gift/treat to us. All around great experience. ",5
" For a restaurant that is supposed to be very good, it was, at best, mediocre. Don’t get me wrong, the service was very good and the food was good, I just expect something better for a restaurant of this caliber and these prices. ",3
" Because of my specific dietary needs, I checked the menu beforehand and made sure there were options available for me.  Unfortunately, the menu changed within the two weeks I checked &amp; the two options I had were no longer available. The menu states that there are no substitutions. The waiter boasted that the chef was creative &amp; that’s why the menu changes. However, the chef wasn’t able to accommodate me. For an extremely pricey restaurant, with a creative chef, I would expect I would have options. We left after a drink and salad, disappointed, as we came for my 40th birthday dinner. ",2
" Great view of the valley and that part was awesome. The service was good, but the food was not good at all. They sell a piece of Halibut for $40 and it was very dry and tasted old. The Chef should be embarrassed to plate such garbage! At the end of the day, Top of The Rock is just a hotel restaurant. Don't waste your time for dinner! ",2
" Was not the right place for ladies night, oops! My younger sister was in town for a special occasion with her friends. ",5
" Greeted nicely, offered Happy Anniversary!  Food good.  Views awesome ",4
" Food was just OK. Slow night but very slow service. Dessert took 45 minutes and was wrong when it came out. Valet service was MIA. I had to fetch my keys from valet desk myself and get car, as well as a few other people. ",1
 The service was very poor. The restaurant was not very busy and they completely forgot to give us an entree. When we reminded the server who never checked on us after dinner was served. They gave us an appetizer while we waited for the entree but by the time we got the missing entree everyone was finished with their dinner. The server was very casual about the mistake and blamed the kitchen. The food was excellent but the error truly ruined our dinner. ,3
" The food and service were fantastic. We sat outside looking over Phoenix on a beautiful night. Very attentive wait staff, great wine and dinner was excellent. I would recommend this for a great place to dine. ",5
" Wow what a view! I couldn't have picked a better date spot on our first night in Phoenix. My fiance and I enjoyed a charcuterie plate and cocktails during happy hour. We loved the food, drinks and dramatic views so much that we stayed for dinner! If you're looking for stunning views and great cocktails in a romantic setting, look no further. ",5
 The service was excellent.  Our server made recommendations and was attentive.  The atmosphere is among the best in the city ,5
 Very good food and service. Dined in the evening and the view of the city was enjoyable. ,4
" Excellent food. Everything we tried was top notch and well presented. It is Ala-carte and the prices are high, but worth it for a special occasion. ",4
" The view was wonderful!!   The staff was above outstanding!! We enjoyed the food, we hope next year you will have a different menu for variety.. for New Year’s Eve..   Will plan to bring our friends to enjoy the wonderful service and that view... ",5
" Overrated and overpriced place.   NY eve limited/fixed menu - 3 pre-selected dishes.  Asked for well done meat, was told only medium rare is available.  Ordered bottle of sparkling wine from Italy (1 of only 3 sparkling wines in total in the menu), again it was not available in normal size (750ml), was offered couple of tiny ones (120ml) as substitution, twice the price per glass.  Decided to order another one local then (from California). It looked very cheap with screw-on cap. Servant spilled it when tried to open it. It came warm, room temperature, they didn't even bother cooling it.  Buffalo meat came over burned, with strong burnt charcoal taste. Not eatable. View of night city is OK, but nothing close to spectacular.  0 entertainment.  And all of that for the price of 300USD for the family of 3. ",2
" Went here for New Years Eve dinner.  Excellent view from the patio and heaters were provided.  Food was fresh, unique and presented well. ",5
 New Years eve ,2
" Went for New Year's Eve, could not have asked for better service.  One slight problem, one of the wygou steaks had a tremendous amount of grissle and fat.  They knocked $20.00 off the bill, would have rather had a good steak. ",3
" First, we requested outdoor dining and as it was getting chilly a heater was brought over. The heater went out and  after 15 minutes of waiting, with nobody coming over, we moved ourselves indoors. During this 15 minutes the only service we received was an introduction and waters brought to the table. Another 10 minutes indoors and we finally got menus. We ordered and got the chicken &amp; donuts. Not as good as I remembered; way too much cream cheese. Our main courses arrived after another 30 minutes. The carbonara was mildly warm with the plate burning hot. The poor server burnt her fingers (she told us) so one would have thought the food would be warm. The steak (and my father is not picky) tasted spoiled so it was sent back. He had a hard time cutting the medium rare meat and I felt horrible for bringing him to get a bad tasting dinner. The view is great but I’ll not be returning here. I’ve visited 4 times over the years and it continues to get worse. Too bad as Tempe really needs some good restaurants. ",1
 Highly recommend. Wait staff was incredible. View was amazing. Food was tremendous. Parking could be better only negative. Cannot say enough good things about this restaurant and our experience. ,5
" Price was a bit high but can’t beat the service, the food, the unlimited mimosas, and especially the view. ",5
 Just a Christmas dinner with my mom and older brother.  Great venue and food!  Thanks so much for accommodating us even though we were running 30 minutes behind. ,5
" If you want the best of the best, you find The Top Of The Rock exceeds your expectations in every which way you think. It is one of the most scenic, tastefully decorated place to spoil yourself and your special company. Your gourmet taste buds will be jumping of joy. A MUST in Phoenix. Enjoy! ",5
" Very nice Christmas brunch.  We were seated at a table by the window with beautiful views and watched the sun set.  Delicious seafood bar, prime rib with horseradish was excellent. ",3
" I was looking for a place for Christmas dinner for a party of eight.  My party included 4 adults and 4 children I needed somewhere that would appease so many culinary taste buds. Most venues had a set menu and only one price.  I appreciated the child price, even though I think my 13 year old grandson and his cousins ate like the adults. My 1 year old grandson very much enjoyed eating from any plate that passed by him.I’m generally not a fan of buffets but this worked. There was a variety of selections. The staff was very accommodating and professionally, the view was spectacular, and we definitely enjoyed the food selections. Seating was a breeze I would definitely consider the Top of the Rock restaurant in the future for a special occasion. ",4
" We were looking forward to a memorable experience for Christmas.  I was disappointed.  It was like going through any cheap restaurant buffet line and the food was no better, maybe not even as good as some.  The price was high for me and I felt we got not much for it.  The service was nonexistent and yet you charged me 18% for a tip.  The total of the service we received was a refill on water and a pickup of dirty dishes.  The views are beautiful but not worth the 175 dollar bill.  Sorry to have to say this, but we won't be back. ",3
 Our server was great....and the whole staff was warm and gracious. We have eaten at the Top of the Rock several times. The view is great but the friendly staff is greater. ,5
 Excellent food. However the restaurant had almost nothing for vegetarians. My spouse is a vegetarian. Also the people that served had no knowledge about vegetarian food. This is surprising for a 5 star hotel! ,3
 Christmas Day brunch...very nice spread and selections - nicley attentive service. An excellent experience ,5
" We enjoyed Christmas brunch at the Top of the Rock. The food was very good, service excellent and views incredible. We would certainly return!  Our favorite was the turkey even though the short ribs were a close second. ",5
 I have been to this restaurant a number of times and it is always good.  Great food and good service ,5
" Wonderful view, food. Excellent decor. The service was competent, engaging and friendly but not completely attentive; once we had our waiter's attention all was well, but often it took a while to get it. ",4
 Disappointing ,2
" Food was delicious. Our waitress was a pleasant individual however it seemed as thought she was over extended.  We waited an extended time for her to return and take another drink order, our food was served by servers not associated with our table nor did the waitress return to ask if everything was satisfactory and or if the orders were correct.  By virtue of the orders not being delivered by our waitress the servers had to ask and shuffle around to get our plates to us.  Additionally, the noise level on the lower floor was such that it made casual conversation difficult. ",4
 Went in for the early dinner just after 5pm to beat the happy hour and dinner crowd.  Have  been here once before . Checked menu on line. Made reservations on line. In  and out. ,5
" Arrived 20 min. early for a 12:15 pm reservation but were seated within 10 minutes. (Glad we had a reservation - there was  a line and people and a 20-30 minute wait). We were surprised at how how full the restaurant and bar area  tables were pre-noon on a Tuesday! As a result, the kitchen was slow but the wait-staff were very cordial and kept stopping by to refresh our drinks. The entrees were excellent - it was worth the slow kitchen wait. ",3
 Alex was awesome and restored a past experience we had that wasn't as great.  She was phenomenal and hope we get her at our table next time! ,5
 Our server Alex was friendly and knowledgeable.  Our food was ordered and served in a timely manner.  Unfortunately my steak was over cooked but when doing his check back I informed Alex of the problem.  Another steak was started immediately and the second one was perfect.  The manager stopped by to apologize and see if we needed anything else.   When our check came I noticed the steak was not on the check.  I was Impressed that they didn't charge me for it  and will return soon to dine again. ,5
" Great wood grilled entrees. Salmon, blue cheese steak were outstanding. Not rushed at all. ",5
" Food was very good, and service was exemplary. ",5
" Also my guests enjoyed the stay, atmospher, food, taste, service, sure we will come back. ",4
" I had the wood grilled salmon, the best I ever ate, crispy skin and great flavor. My wife had the filet mignon she was very pleased. I would recommend to anyone. ",5
 Customer service is extremely important to my family. As much as I hate to admit this but I don't recall my server's name (which I usually catch as soon as we sit down) however she was absolutely fabulous. She was on her game and was so pleasant and delightful. My family owns 16 restaurants so I know what service means and she clearly displayed it.  My husband had another diet coke before he was even done and didn't have to wait. I had a Coors light with a shot of blood Mary mix and it was at the table in no time.  Thank you for everything. I would highly recommend her. She deserves a spot bonus $$ (and not just because) but because she was AWESOME! Thank you! My husband and I will be back - what a great kick off to our date night.  Thank you! ,5
" Server messed up my order, so I had to eat something I never ordered since I didn't want to eat alone. Won't be back ",3
" Great food, incredible service.  It can be VERY LOUD inside. ",4
" We were a table of 6 on a busy Saturday  night. Steve S provided the best service I've encountered in a long time. He was friendly, professional, attentive, and efficient. ",4
" My wife and I had our first date at Firebirds, and each year since, on the ""anniversary"" of our first date, we've stopped in to celebrate.  The service and food are always top notch, and this year, the staff went above and beyond, taking special note of our special occasion.  The folks at Firebirds were wonderful, and the food was as amazing as always.  I highly recommend this location.  Well done, and thank you, everyone at Firebirds Chandler. ",5
" Were meeting friends for lunch.  Each of us was told that we were the first to arrive and then seated in different parts of the restaurant.  After 30 minutes we finally figured out ourselves that we all in the restaurant, but not seated together.  In addition, we had three different servers introduce themselves as ""our server"".  The right hand does not know what the left hand is doing in this place.  Will not return. ",3
" Happy Hour was a great value.  I went to Firebirds specifically to celebrate my birthday , however, and was specifically looking furward to the Prime Rib as I have been told it is, hands down, the best. I even had a free entree birthday coupon for The Keg but I decided I'd rather pay to experience the amazing prime rib I'd heard so much about on my special day.  When it was time to order (shortly after 7pm on a Thursday), I was informed they had no prime rib. As you can imagine, I was severely disappointed and regretted not going to The Keg! ",3
" Went to dinner for wife's and a friend's Birthday, perfect place to celebrate and relax! ",5
 Great Happy Hours and good food.  The complimentary bread was fresh and warm. ,4
" We ordered the filet - wanted it pink in the middle and was told to order it medium well.  The steaks are very thin and it came back over-cooked....it was good,  tender, just overcooked.   The Southwest Potatoes Au Gratin were yummy - otherwise, the food was just ok. The server was not outgoing - she was efficient but quiet, not overly friendly. The food is good for the price but not memorable.  The dining room is very noisy so talking is sometimes difficult. ",4
 Our reservation was for 8pm we arrive early  was seated by a hostess some what seems to enjoy her job Waitress was there but not attentive  Drink from the bar was poorly made  The salmon dish was not appetizing no taste to it Ribs could have cook much better  was very dry. Overall experience was poor  Will not return. ,2
 Excellent for the price. Wouldn't say the steak was as great as ruth chris but for the value it's well worth it.  Requested to be sat at a booth online because of a kid. Came there and it was perfect. ,4
 It took 3 tries to get my date's steak correct and the kitchen manager lied to us about her food. The only thing that was good about the experience was our waitress. ,1
" One of our long-time favorites.  Always good food, cooked exactly as requested.  Top quality ingredients.  Becka was a remarkable server - friendly, non-intrusive, anticipated well, etc. ",5
" Amazing environment with a view and great food, although the dessert did not meet my expectations. ",4
 The Arizona Restaurant Week menu was fabulous. We especially loved the rack of lamb and filet mignon - best meat I've had in a while. The desserts were not good; fill up on an extra appetizer instead. ,4
" Positives:  They prepared a few items, special, in a certain way for us which was nice.  They prepared a few items, special, in a certain way for us which was nice.  The food was good and hot when it arrived.  The staff was very nice.  They sat us on the outside patio like I had made the reservations for.  They featured an Arizona Restaurant week menu with a wide variety of options.  Good place for a di  Negs:  The service was a little slow and we had multiple people waiting on us; our reservations were later in the evening and it wasn't that crowded inside so I was a bit surprised.  The wine by the glass was limited, not very good and expensive.  The views on the outdoor patio were nice but it was loud from the h.way ",3
" Terrific. The food, service and view were wonderful. ",4
" All went well, until I received my bill. My wife and I had ordered two (each) Stoli on the rocks, when we received our bill the tab for the 4 drinks was $56, or $14 per drink. It stated on the bill that we were served Stoli Elite which we did not order. I opted not to say anything to our wait person but later regreted my decision. ",3
" The Arizona week idea was excellent. The food amount was perfect for each of the entrees. I would recomment this restaurant for its food taste, ambiance including the views and personal service to its guests. The food was outstanding and prepared to perfection. ",5
" My wife and I dined here during restaurant week. This restaurant has a stellar location with incredible views. Sadly, the restaurant is showing its age badly. Service was adequate, but not fine dining service. The first course, Seared Ahi and Gnochii, was probably the best course. Both items were well prepared and flavorful. The second course was ok, but everything was lacking seasoning. Our proteins, lamb and filet, were well prepared but the side items were bland on both plates. Third course was good, but the dishes were not well executed. The trio of creme brulee was very tasty, but none of them had set up properly. Bananas Foster was more of the same, flavorful but looked like a soupy mess. ",3
" Very good food, friendly staff, great view and had a wonderful dinner out on a Friday night after work. Will be sure to go back. ",5
 We visited for Restaurant Week and the food and service was great! ,4
" I went to Top of the Rock to take advantage of the Arizona Resturant Week deal.  First we had a little trouble finding the place. By following a few of the signs around the resort we were able to find it fairly easily after the first wrong turn. The free valet parking helped make up for the minor annoyance.  The first course wasn't served for almost an hour after we were seated and we were only given one bread roll each to tide us over. Once the food arrived the portion sizes were good and the food was excellent quality. I hade the salmon which was good sized and served perfectly cooked, but was nothing special. My date got the lamb and loved it. The desserts were tasty but again nothing noteworthy.  Good for special occasions. ",4
 We ate outside and the ambiance was incredible with starlit views of the city. The waiter did not rush us as we had our wine enjoying the view. The food portions were great as we have encountered very small portions at other restaurant week restaurants. The food was cooked perfectly--lamb and filet mignon. Sides and desserts also great. We would definitely go back if this restaurant as well as others reduce their regular prices somewhat so we can enjoy all year round. ,5
" The whole experience was wonderful. Food was great, service was first class. Will be going back. ",5
 Top of the Rock was beyond fantastic!!!!!!! ,1
 Our meal was delicious and our service was great! ,4
" Our server, George, was most excellent.  We had a birthday group &amp; he was very attentive &amp; helpful &amp; pleasant.  The food was good, crab cakes being not quite as good as usual.  But it was a great time.  We love Firebirds!  Thank you. ",5
" Great food, nice atmosphere, decent prices; dinner quantities were large so it's either an appetizer or dessert, not both.  Highly recommend Firebirds Chandler for a relaxing night out of great food and a short walk to a movie afterwards.  Keep up the good work! ",5
" The food was delicious, a little heavy on the seasoning on the ribeye, but very tender and juicy.  Portions were generous.  Menu selection was terrific.  Staff was very friendly: Bob, our server was great and Alison, the manager on duty was very nice as well.   We enjoyed our visit very much and will return. ",4
 This is my favorite mid priced restaurant in the valley. ,4
 We met for a business dinner with our two new physician partners and the table arrangement was poor (one square/one round) for conversation and comfort.  The waitress was very good and attentive.  We would probably not return for a business dinner. ,3
" We had a very relaxing and leisurely lunch out on their patio!   The desk hostess was very friendly and upbeat!  Our food server had a slow start, but quickly picked up her service.  The food was very tasty, nicely presented and the portions were quite generous.  I would highly recommend this establishment for its patio dining and food. ",4
" Only problem was that they brought our entrees before we were finished with appetizers, seemed to rush us ",3
 I've been sampling Phoenix's best this week for restaurant week. Top of the Rock has had the best filet (medallions) by far. I had a salad with champagne vinegarette...it was amazing. The wine list was..okay. The bottles are reasonable. Great set up and easy to find. The tables are spaced far apart which I appreciated. ,5
 We went the first night of the AZ Restaurant week and the restaurant was very busy. The view is spectacular. The rack of lamb and filet mignon were delicious. Our waiter was great. He kept us updated as to what was going on in the kitchen. It seems the kitchen was not prepared for the number of people and the staff was very slow in getting the food prepared for the waiter to serve. The manager came to our table and we did not have to pay for our wine. We were also given coupons to use on a return visit. We do plan on going back. ,3
" We visited during resturant week and the food was good. However, service was slow. At the third hour we were just receiving our dessert and had completed dinner almost an hour before. Needed to have more staff available. ",3
 The view was wonderful. The food was great but the service was very slow. We still had a wonderful time. I think that many of the restaurants have cut back on staff due to the slow times. They can't keep people employed for one week of hot business. All in all we enjoyed the experience. ,4
" Went to Top of the Rock for their Sunday Brunch. It was wonderful as always and the mimosas flowed endlessly! I did notice, though, that they have taken some items off their buffet. They use to have sushi but they not longer have that. The music was a little loud. It would have been nice to have it turned down. Server was very pleasant. I would definitely recommend this for someone looking for a special occasion brunch. I am sure when it is cooler it will be a lovely place for outdoor dining. ",4
" Excellent service. We were initially sat in the middle of the restaurant, but I told the waitress that we would like a window seat, and that occurred without question. View was of I-10, but the city lights and planes taking off in the distance were visible. It was a special occasion and the waitress even took care of one of the two desserts we ordered. Food was decent; some items much better than others. The tomato soup and Gnocci were our favorite items. The other menu items were not noteworthy, especially given the price. ",3
" Staff is polite, friendly, and professional. Very knowledgable of the menu and wine list. The food was excellent, and the view from up top is exceptional. There was a storm coming in, with lots of lightning; very spectacular. Worth going back many times. ",5
" The ambience and sevice was outstanding and the food was very good to outstanding, too. ",5
" Still one of the best overall Sunday Brunch locations in the valley. While you can argue about the value, you just can't top the overall experience at the Top of the Rock in Tempe. Great ambiance, awesome view, great service and food. If you are looking for a spot in the East Valley to take someone special to make a great impression this is the place. ",4
 Our dinner was wonderful! Will defintly return in the future! ,5
 The Top of the Rock is a terrific place for an intimate dinner. ,5
" great service, terrific view, delicious and abundant brunch offerings. Meat carving station, fruit and cheese table, dessert table, lunch table, omelet station, crepe station (crepes pre-made), seafood station, chocolate fountain. The only thing we missed was some type of potato (hash browns, home fries, etc.), but there were so many other options - it wasn't a big deal. Bottomless mimosas, coffee, tea, juice. Excellent waitstaff. I want to go again tomorrow!! ",5
" The service was great. The food was fabulous. They even made me a drink that wasn't on the menu. The only small negative thing I would say is, they didn't refill our water glasses until we asked. ",4
 Our experience at your restaurant short of Outstanding. We will return. Mr. and Mrs. R. L. Larsh Jr. ,5
 Food was outstanding and the view was great! ,4
 The food was excellent but the kitchen seemed overwhelmed. Long waits for entrees for several of the tables around us including ours. 45 minutes from salad to entree delivery put a dmaper on the experience. Couldn't even keep our drinks full during lull. That would've helped if we could've found our server. ,3
 A great place for a casual night out or for a special occasion. The food matches the lovely view. ,4
 The service staff was very good. Our glasses were always full and staff was very professional and nice. The view was spectacular. Very romantic. The omelet and waffle bar were great. On the other hand I found the rest of the food was just ok. I was expecting a little more for the money. ,3
" My girlfriend and I had the opportunity to go this past weekend and had one of the most memorable evenings of our life. The atmosphere was near perfect and the service an excellent pair of aces. I would recommend this spot to anyone looking to create a memorable day. Thank you Joe and Lisa, you were both great. The best anniversary so far. ",5
 I could not have been more pleased with the exceptional service that we received. The atmosphere was very warm and friendly and I can't say enough about the knowledgeable staff and their wonderful service. I received the exact table arrangment that I requested and I never had to ask for anything. First Class/Top Notch!! ,4
" Service and restaurant was outstanding. Food was ""OK"" on a very limited menu. For a good steak at those prices better off going to Ruth C. ",3
 The appetizers were fantastic - particularly enjoyed the gnocchi. The entrees were delicious but the scallop dish is overpriced. The vanilla dessert was disappointing. ,4
 Crepe station is the best.  Attentive servers. ,4
" If you want to impress an out of town guest with your good taste and flair for adventure take them to The ""Top of the Rock"" they and you will be impressed. ",4
 We requested 'Romantic' and believed the table would be more intimate. The 2 tables we were given the choice of included #1 with a pole on the view side and #2 table sat us across from one another. We quickly rearranged the #2 table seating so we could sit side-by-side.  The food and service were exquisitely beyond compare. ,4
" Outstanding view and wonderfully prepared food. Delicious. Service was very attentive, but not intrusive. ",5
" Loved EVERYTHING about it, except the choice of music. It didn't fit the ambiance. They need to put something more romantic and not so weird. ",4
 The Top of the Rock restaurant is a place that whomever you dine with will remember. It's amazing view during the day and espeically overlooking the lights at night is beatiful. The food is a presentation in itself as well as flavorful. My husband and I enjoy our anniversaries or taking people somewhere we consider a treat. ,5
" My date's steak and my fish were cooked perfectly. Alas, the accompanying goo overwhelmed the fish. Can't gripe about the service or the view; both were first-rate. ",3
 Very nice and the view is great ,5
" The food was great, but the service was lackluster. Incredible service for the first half of the meal, but then a real lack of attention at the end. Waitress dropped off dessert menu and returned over 10 minutes later. It took another 10 minutes to get my credit card back after I paid the bill. If the service was on the same level for the whole date, it would have been incredible, but it really fell off during that second half. ",3
" Even though we drive past a number of brunch establishments on the way from east Scottsdale, Top of the Rock continues to be worth the trip. My wife loves the lamb chops and the eggs Benedict; I like the array of cold dishes. There's even a chocolate fountain, if you're into that sort of thing (I'm not), and an interesting selection of things available to be ""chocolatized"". The friendly service, unlimited bubbly, and scenic view combine to make the whole experience something you'll want to do on a regular basis. Incidentally, this place ain't too shabby for dinner, especially if you can catch a sunset or thunderstorm through the big windows. ",5
" Visited with my wife and 12 year old son for brunch. Wonderful food and selection. Surprisingly kid-friendly. Waitress even took the time to walk him to the waffle station and make sure he got his order. Price caught us by surprise. $125 for 3 people for brunch (before tax and tip). Overall we'd go back for a special occasion, but not an every weekend brunch spot. ",4
" Because of the open feel(high ceiling in particular)this restaurant lacks coziness. The food was ok for the price but I would suggest other if you are spending that kind of money. Beautiful scenic views, however, I think the restaurant knows this and therefore places less emphasis on the other areas critical to an expensive restaurant. Notable issue: it was freezing cold in the restaurant. We asked on a number of occasions to warm it up and they did try but to no avail. The table next to us even had a woman with the table cloth over her shoulders in attempt to stay warm. She ultimately left quite upset and without eating.  All in all I can not recommend this place. ",2
" Vedry nice for a special evening out, we normally go there for a special occassion like a birthday or anniversary. The atmosphere is nice. Food was excellent. ",4
" Top of the Rock is NOT what it used to be! We were informed that new management has taken over and in my opinion, they should get the old management back. The menu is very limited, the service is OK, and the place was FREEZING! Despite several requests to lower the AC, the system kept the place fit for ice cubes! We were informed by the restaurant manager that it was an older AC system and there was nothing they could do to fix it except move us to a table outside. This might have been an option, however it is NOVEMBER! I realize we are in Arizona but you do not really need to run the AC at night and freeze out all of the dinner guests. A true disappointment. We will never be back! ",1
 Nice setting and enjoyed the restaurant and setting. We had a business dinner and could hear each other talk. ,4
" Food was very good, service even better. Fine dining with a great view. ",4
" The atmosphere and brunch were wonderful! The champagne kept coming and the food was spectacular! Chocolate fountain, crepe chef, salads, pastas, shrimp,crab...it was delightful. I would definitely recommend this brunch to couples. ",5
" This was not the first time I visited Top of the Rock for brunch. My last visit - a couple years ago was excellent, and as a result I was genuinely looking forward to this visit. To be blunt - not nearly as good this time. There seemed to be less food, less choice. With the exception of breakfast croissants and some Danish no other bread choices at at all. Very disappointing. Prime rib was delicious as were the pancakes. Eggs Benedict was cold and over-cooked. The bacon was also cold. Salad selection was minimal as was dessert. General feeling - this was brunch ""lite"" - except for the price, which implied full brunch service. This meal did not live up to what I remember as Top of the Rock standards. Service was slow and sparse. ",3
 I have dined here on 4 occasions but this one the first time service was not ewxceptional. Our server was NOT attentive like usual. Hopefully he was just having a bad night and this isn't a reflextion on over-all service ,4
" Excellent view, great service! I will be back. ",5
 Eating at Top of the Rock was a last minute idea and was a pleasant surprise for dinner. Upon arriving the view and the layout of the restaurant was breath taking. We were seated by the window so we were able to enjoy the view of the city lights which was a nice plus! Our server was timely and knowledgeable when it came to the menu and wine and did assist with some great recommendations. Overall a great restaurant for a nice romantic dinner. ,5
 We were expecting it to be romantic. It was too bright to be romantic. ,4
" I've been to the Top of the Rocks Champagne Sunday brunch which is great! This dinner was average. The Creme brulee dessert was a disappointment though although the bread pudding was a surprisingly good. The asparagus was over cooked though and the salmon, I thought, had too much of the pesto sauce downing the fish. And the scenic view is much better in the day I think. ",3
" Food was great, wine list was good. Was able to catch an orange harvest moon rise as we were dining which was breathtaking. We sat by the window, but in the cooler season I would presume dining outside is a must. The decor has a 80""s retro arizona feel. The top of the rock does not have its own bar so you have to go downstairs if you want to arrive early and have a drink. My only complaint would be with this part of our experience. The bartender was friendly but had no idea of wine recommendations or the differences between liquor. She seemed rough around the edges and unwilling to go upstairs to get items that she hadn't stocked in the bar. The chairs we sat on were literally broken. There was no music and lacked ambience. ",4
 Overall excellent experience. Time between courses was a bit long: dinner took about two hours. If the time between courses were shortened it would have been perfect. The food was spectacular as was the view. A highly recommended dining experience in the valley. ,5
" I had not been to the Top of the Rock for awhile and was pleasantly surprised. The food and service was excellent! I also enjoyed the beautiful view of the city. I must say, the Seared Ahi entree was some of the best I have had anywhere. I will be back again. ",5
" It's been probably 15 years since my last brunch experience at Top Of The Rock (moved out of state and then came back to AZ) and it did not disappoint! The food was exceptional, the service impeccable, and the overall experience make it highly recommendable to others. ",5
" Celebrating our 18th anniversary and looking for something special which we mentioned on our reservation reques. However, disappointed that nothing was said or done to help commemorate the occasion. We did enjoy the beautiful scenery and quiet atmosphere but food wasn't spectacular for the price. My caprese salad was disappointing with mushy tomatoes and tasteless mozzarella. Hubby enjoyed his she-crab soup. Both our steaks were delicious. Still, not sure we couldn't have found something more memorable. ",3
" I made a 6:30pm reservation for our 22nd Wedding Anniversary and it was perfect timing. We watched the sunset around 7:15pm and the view was wonderful. Our server was a sweet young guy who provided excellent service. We really liked Salvador, the bread guy, as well. Our sweet potato gnocchis were terrific. The steaks with the Dianne sauce were amazing. The asparagus and carrots were cooked perfectly. I liked my husband's yukon potatoes better than my mashed potatoes. Overall, we were quite impressed and will return for sure. ",5
" The food was out of this world! One of the best steaks we have ever tasted. And the requests were honored (table by a window, acknowledgement of anniversary) which was much appreciated. The service started out outstanding, but waitress never did come back to pick up the payment of our bill nor bring our receipt. We had to flag down another waiter to completed the process. No indication why (like she went on break and was turning over to another server); she just disappeared. ",3
" we were celebrating our 30th anniversary, and this restaurant was a perfect choice. ",5
" We were looking for a place for a birthday celebration and remembered Top of The Rock. It had been many years since we dined there. My sea bass with truffle risotto was perfection. My companion ordered the strip steak and had no complaints about quality or preparation. Our waiter was attentive without being intrusive. We had a window table with a wonderful view, especially after sunset. I can't understand why there weren't more diners. There is nothing fancy or off-putting here. In my opinion, Top of the Rock is a forgotten gem. ",4
" It had been many years since we last dined at Top of the Rock, so we were looking forward to a return visit. The restaurant had very few diners for a Saturday evening. Our service was very attentive, the salads were excellent and the entrees were quite good, although a little overpriced ($32-36) for what we received. We were celebrating two birthdays, but the server didn't mention the dessert was complimentary until after we had only ordered one to share among the four of us. We had the triple creme brule, which was ""undercooked,"" a bit runny. The ambiance at sunset is always nice as the sky fades and the lights of Phoenix emerge. ",3
" I could have given this restaurant a higher rating had there not been a screaming child dining near us. I blame the parental units, more than the kid, for poor control of their child. The food was good, nicely presented, but the potatoes were over salted and the vegetable serving were quite sparse. ",4
" Very weak wine list for the type of restaurant. Most of the selection is available at Safeway! Otherwise, everything was pretty much as expected. ",4
 Very friendly staff from hostess to the kitchen. THe food was excellent as is the view at sunset. On this visit the service was good but not timely. Drink orders took too long to arrive. We were celebrating an anniversary and were not in a hurry but the service did lag a little. This was not our experience on prior visits. Still one of our favortie spots. ,4
" We visited Top of the Rock for our third wedding anniversary. We placed reservations ahead, requesting a table with a view, but were nearly half an hour late. Not only were we immediately seated when we arrived, but they had held the best table in the restaurant for us! The view of the sunset over Phoenix was spectacular, but what really made the visit enjoyable was the wonderful service and food. We count ourselves foodies, but were absolutely blown away from the first taste of the sweet potato gnocchi with wild mushrooms. The wine list was impressive, and the staff was able to help us select a bottle that matched our tastes perfectly! Every dish was perfectly cooked, brought out promptly, and no glass ran dry. A fantastic evening! ",5
" Great views and usually great food. Although service is usually excellent, this time it was VERY slow and there were errors in the order. The wait staff seemed harried because of a large party. We've been dining there for over 20 years and this was the first ""glitch"". We'll do it again. ",4
" We ate at Top of the Rock restaurant as part of our 10th wedding anniversary trip to Phoenix in May 2010. When making reservations, I had explained the reason for our visit and specifically requested a table with the best view; when we got there it appeared that they had never read our request. We were seated in a booth with a decent view, but the waiter seemed stuffy, not at all personable, and certainly didn't go out of his way to make us feel welcome. Top of the Rock definitely had wonderful food and pleasant ambiance, but we didn't leave feeling like it was particularly special. Overall, a nice enough restaurant but it didn't blow us away. ",3
" My wife and I were looking for somewhere ""new to us"" to enjoy a special evening. We were very impressed with everything about our experience at Top of the Rock! The three courses were all SO tasty and cooked to perfection. Yum! My wife loved her steak choice and I think the scallops were some of the best I've tasted. Our choices of dessert overlooking the city view were a delight. Our waitress had the right blend of attention to our needs as well as giving us space. We enjoyed our food and evening so much we have already decided we will be going back again within the next couple of months. ",5
 The food and service were very good. Good value for the price. Great views. Overall a great experience. ,4
" The food was great! Fabulous atmosphere and extremely friendly and knowledgeable staff. The view was beautiful....what's not to like? I am from the coast and love seafood. Top of the Rock just added Seared Sea Scallops to their menu that night we were there. I had to try them.....and they were the most delicious rendition of scallops I have ever tried. I wa SO PLEASED. My wife is from Wyoming, and had the beef medallions. She couldn't stop cooing as to how tender and tasty the beef was. We both left very satisfied and are looking forward to our next dinner there, soon! Closed on Mondays, but midweek visits can give you the window table of your choice. ",5
" On a short vacation to Tempe,Az. found this most beautiful restaurant. The view was spectacular as was the ambiance. Our meal was wonderful and our server was outstanding. Would highly recommend. ",5
 Really enjoyed our romantic night. Had a table right by the window so we could take in all the beatiful city lights. ,4
 This was my first time but my coworkers talked about it so much and they were right. What a great place to eat it has it all. ,5
" Our experience at Top of the Rock was outstanding. The menu was small, but offered something for everybody --- a good thing. Fantastic ambience with a great view of the valley. Very romantic. The food was excellent. The service was great without being overbearing. A great all-around experience. ",5
 The entire experience was fabulous! We may go there again for our next anniversary. ,5
" I feel you have a nice set up but believe $150 for three people for Sunday brunch is a little overboard. The view was great, I had people from out of town with me so they enjoyed the ambiance. Staff was pleasant. ",3
 Excellent food and service with a magnificient view of Phoenix. ,5
 We were met by the Chef at the door. The main entree was excellent (lamb and rib eye). The service was good. The view is to die for. I would recommend for any special occasion. ,4
" This was our 4th visit in as many years, but we'll start coming back much more often. From appetizers through desserts (BTW, the bread pudding is the best I've had anywhere), everything was flawless and cooked exactly to order. Oddly, though, the wine list isn't what you'd expect from a restaurant of this caliber. We were lucky and managed to find a wine that paired nicely with our entrées, but it was touch-and-go for a while. Our server took good care of us and somebody who appeared to be of a managerial nature also checked up on us a couple of times (nothing intrusive, just enough to let us know they cared). Even the buspersons and table runners were friendly and efficient. ",4
" First time diner, would go back again. My sea bass was outstanding! ",5
" Menu was limited, but food was very good. ",4
" I read some negative reviews on this place, so given the price I was a little leery, but my experience was great. The service was top quality, the waitstaff were all very polite, and the food was very good. Also, I would recommend taking advantage of their daily special of you can. It's a 3-course meal for only $34. Otherwise, you'll be paying a la carte prices, which can add up very quickly. The wine is overpriced, but no more than anywhere else. This is a great place for a romantic date, or a good location for a adult group dinner. I wouldn't recommend taking kids there, however. This is definitely a grown-up spot! ",4
" Great restaurant.  Food was excellent, been there several times and have not been disapointed.  Excellent Sunday Brunch. ",5
" Perhpas it was just that it was restaurant week, but I was not greatly impressed with the food. ",3
 We had a delightful experience. I would highly recommend The Top of the Rock at The Buttes to anyone who would like to take someone to a very romantic and scenic restaurant. The food and service was outstanding. ,5
" Overall, it was kind of a sloppy experience. They didn't have sparkling water stocked. The booth seat slid around and was lumpy. The food was good but not spectacular. It feels like it's behind on the times. At one point it was probably a great restaurant, but it's gotten old and I will not go back. Only thing that was above average was the scenic view. However, we were seated in a stupid booth not by the window, even though I specifically requested a window seat through open table. FML. Staff also seamed lazy and uninterested. I didn't feel special whatsoever. ",2
" The setting, the ambiance, the food and the service made for a very nice dining experience. ",4
" We went to Top of the Rock for the Arizona Restaurant Week specials. Our waiter (Robbie) was exceptionally helpful in making recommendations. The views are breathtaking - especially once the sun sets a little bit and the blinds are opened. The food was absolutely delicious. We were very happy with every bite. We will definitely be back, and will highly recommend the restaurant to family and friends. ",5
" Top of the Rock is a very nice place with an amazing view. You can dine inside or out the view is great from both places. Because you are high you are overlooking all the city lights. It is a very romantic place, a great place to make your sweetie feel special or nice for a group with the ambience of the city lights a flame that they set and wonderful food and service. We have also had brunch there at Thanksgiving time one year which was really nice too. I would recommend this to anyone. We also had a great time in the bar one New Years Eve when we didn't have a place to go. The band was a blast and we had a great time. ",5
" Great food great view great service, in these time would love to see a lower price ",4
" One of the most Romantic spots in all of Phoenix!!! The view was the best, A beautifull sunset with a hint of a lightning show to finish off dinner. The service was A ""10"" as allways, very friendly and helpfull staff from parking on up! Have been here before and plan on comeing back time and time again! ",4
" Having travled the world and seen some of the best, this is one of the best kept secrets in Phoenix!!! ",5
" This was our first brunch visit to Top of the Rock (we've been for dinner several times). It won't be our last. The food was good, the service was friendly and efficient (actually, a bit better than the dinner service), and there's always the nice view out the big windows. We've recently paid more for a less-good brunch elsewhere, so we're sticking with Top of the Rock for special-occasion brunches from now on. ",4
" This restaurant offers the best of two worlds - excellent cuisine (the She-Crab Bisque was fantastic), along with one of the best views in Phoenix. A perfect spot for a special occasion! ",5
 Great experience. Our server was very attentive and good. Food was outstanding. Thank you!! ,5
" The service was excellent, food was exquisette and the view was amazing! ",5
 Just what you'd expect from a free-flowing champagne brunch. I appreciated that we felt no pressure to leave. The staff just kept the champagne coming! ,4
" The special on this visit (our 5th) was an interesting rendition of Surf&amp;Turf, in this case sea bass and a double-cut lamb chop. Both were very good, as was the airline chicken. Our server and his assistants cleared and filled and checked up on us, but weren't intrusive. Bread pudding and banana gelato rounded things out. There will definitely be a 6th visit, a 7th, and so on. ",4
" This has been one of our favorite, if not the favorite, restaurants in Phoenix for many years. We love going back and will continue to do so long into the future. Top of The Rock is hands down one of the most beautiful hidden gems the Valley has to offer. Everyone should dine there at least once - and they will be back again after that many more times.  Chris Whelihan ",5
" The food was delicious and the view was amazing. My fiancé and I are interested in having our wedding reception at the Top of the Rock so we decided to have dinner there to see the view at night and to try the food. We went with one other couple and all of the dinners that we ordered were prepared perfectly. There was not one complaint about anything ordered or the service. It was a little bit expensive but well worth it for the quality of the food, service and view. We will definitely be back and it is on the top of the list for our wedding reception! ",5
" The Top of the Rock restaurant always exceeds my expectations. The staff is so friendly and right on top of servicing our table. The food is always exceptional. Love, love, love that place. ",5
" I must say this was our 2nd time to the Stockyards Restaurant and we were much more impressed this time than when we came during Restaurant Week last May.  We were in the back dining room which was lovely, very old world western and possibly had lots of original late 1800's decor. Service once again was terrific, Parker, our server who was also our server when we were there the first time, once again awesome., She has a great personality and makes you feel at home. The biscuits and corn bread with the honey butter that's served on the side is wonderful and I could easily eaten several baskets of them. The fresh vegi relish tray with ranch dressing is a very nice touch. My husband and I shared the Prime Rib for 2 which was huge and we actually took enough home to have lunch the next day. That entree comes with soup or salad and sides of vegetables, whipped potatoes and the whiskey sweet potato mash. I had the cup of steak soup very good, very chunky and my husband choose the salad which he really liked commenting that the Italian dressing was very good. We brought my Mother who ordered the 8 oz prime rib and she thoroughly enjoyed hers, she also had the dinner salad with Italian and commented on how much she enjoyed the dressing and she also got the whipped potatoes  and like it. The Prime Ribs were perfectly cooked as we ordered them, ours rare and my Mother's medium rare and all extremely tender with a great au jus and my husband enjoyed the fresh horseradish. We went for my birthday and I received a complimentary dessert so I choose  the pecan pie with bourbon whipped creme. We shared the dessert and had a hard time finishing it because we were so full but it was delicious. We definitely will return. ",5
 We loved it! Great food and a great view! ,4
 Great tuna appetizer and a fantastic cab wine by Climbing....an autrailian wine. Steaks were good but not fantastic. Enjoyed the view and atmosphere. Wait staff friendly. ,5
 My girlfriend is a vegitarian and the menu was mostly meat and fish. However they were very accomidating to her and our meals turned out wonderful! The staff was very friendly and helpful. Our experience was great and the view was beautiful. ,4
 This restaurant is my absolute favorite in the Phoenix area.  The view as well as the food is spectacular ,5
" The steak was excellent! Overall the food was really well done. Alice, our waitperson, was knowledgeable about the food as well as the history of the restaurant and surrounding area.  A very nice evening with friends made better by good food and good service. ",5
" After reading about The Stockyards in American Airline's  American Way magazine - and having read the reviews on Open Table, my husband and I were looking forward to enjoying some great-tasting steaks at dinner last evening.  Instead we were disappointed. The meat was tasteless and the accompanying sides the same. We did enjoy good service, and the wine list was extensive. However neither of these could make up for the bill which, had our meals been better, we would not have minded paying. ",3
" Unique atmosphere.  Prompt courteous service, great selection,  delicious food. ",5
 Just g_d darn good food at a fare price ,5
" Stockyards is close to my work, so I dine there fairly frequently for work functions and also recently went there for a business dinner. I've never had anything that wasn't fabulous and hear the same from anyone who's been a lunch or dinner companion. The service has also always been excellent. ",5
" The waiter was a snob, very disinterested. Seemed preoccupied and no personality ",4
" We were in PHX on a business trip, and the hotel recommended the Stockyards.  I think that I ordered the wrong thing, and think that I would have done better ordering a steak.  The steaks looked good!  Husband and I each ordered Pecan crusted Walleye.  Well, we love Walleye and once I scraped off the pecan chunks the Walleye was fine.  The pecan ""crust"" was not a crust, but rather looked as if the Walleye had been dredged in chopped pecans (not a coarse chop, but definitely not a fine chop), and it wasn't a crust at all so maybe dredged after searing?  Anyway since the Walleye is pan-seared and then baked, the pecans were fairly soggy.  I wouldn't recommend this dish because of the pecan non-crust.   My husband said his baked potato was excellent.   I ordered the Parmesan Potato Stack which would have been really wonderful except that there was so much garlic, I could not taste any other ingredient.  I really wanted to love these potatoes!  (But couldn't taste them) The salad with a garlicky Ranch dressing was quite good, nice leafy greens and just the right amount of dressing.  A nice crudite plate included beautiful huge purple radishes and Jicama, among other crisp veggies -- this was a very nice touch.  Wonderful house-baked big soft biscuits and nice cornbread muffins.   Very decent wine list by the glass.  Excellent server.  If I lived in PHX I think I would find something that I liked here; unfortunately I didn't on this visit.  Since I come to PHX often I may give this place one more try.  My advice to newcomers:  order meat. ",4
 Stockyards was recommended for dinner by a nearby theater who offered a discount the night of the show. My husband and I love steakhouses and thought we would give it a try.  I must say the service was amazing and the food was impeccable. We had Ron for our server. He was on point with his recommendations and his service was great without being too much. We also has a great bottle of wine at his recommendation that he allowed us to sample first. It seemed a little pricey but we aren't avid wine drinkers so maybe not but he bottled up what we didn't finish to take home. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves steaks and good food but don't mind the premium price! ,5
 The food was excellent and there service was very nice. The food was cooked as requested and described.  It is a little on the pricey side but if you are looking for quality there is none better than The Stockyards ,5
" Great meal. And our server was THE BEST! All the steaks were tasty and cooked perfectly. My wife had fish and it was good, too. The bartender made a nice martini...all over, I can heartily endorse this for a wonderful night out! ",5
 We had a large group that had a lot of last minute changes. They were extremely accommodating for our group of 17. Service was fantastic and the food was cooked to perfection. We will be back! ,5
" The steaks and buffalo were excellent, perfectly seasoned and cooked exactly as ordered. The dinner salad and Caesar salad were ordinary. The wine list was also acceptable, but could really use a better selection of mid-priced Cabernet Sauvignon. Service was generally very good, but there were a couple of times we could not get anyone's attention, probably due to the noise. The dining room décor was ""subdued western"", like a ranch living room. Unfortunately the alcoves and booths did not help with the overwhelming room noise. The four of us, in a booth, were almost shouting at each other in order to be heard, and thus adding to the total noise pollution.  Our party aged from the late 50's to mid 60's, and we enjoy good conversation, in addition to great food.   We won't be returning to the Stockyards. ",1
 As always the attention given by the waitress was exceptional. the quality of the food also exceptional. Highly recommended. ,5
 For me this restaurant has many memories. I ate here with my father while attending ASU in 1969. It was excellent then and it is excellent now. I recommend some soft gentle music. Perhaps Western Classics or Ballads. We must not lose these great structures and places that made early vintage Phoenix uniquely special before urban sprawl destroyed it's ambiance. ,5
" The rib eye steaks were the best my husband and I have had in a long time.  Flavorful, juicy, tender and not too much fat.  The meals also came with vegetables and dip, breads, soup or salad and a potato choice.  The atmosphere was old school steak house.  Loved it. Have already recommended it to friends.  A very special dinner on our vacation. ",5
 I have been going to The Stockyards for over 30 years. My employer Dave Schuff personally made some of the steel tables in the entry way about 50 years ago or so. Very authentic restaurant with great food and service. ,5
 Everything was wonderful. Service was great.  Loved those steaks. ,5
 Took my dad out for dinner ,5
 It was our first time and I must say the steaks were great being that I from Dallas where we have great steak restaurants.  If I'm ever back in Phoenix  I would definitely go back to Stockyards for dinner. ,4
" We were looking for a local flavor, non-chain restaurant. Thought with all its history it would have a historic feel. Didn't really accomplish that feat. The food quality was good and the service was very good.  But overall we have been to much better restaurants throughout our travels in this country. ",4
 The steaks were excellent - cooked to perfection and the service was professional and personable.  There was a large group of party goers however that were so loud we had to yell at each other to be heard and they really ruined another wise perfect meal.  Perhaps the restaurant should strive to separate large groups from couples dining. ,4
" I've been wanting to go to the stockyard since the eary eightys, glad I finnaly got the chance. My prime rib wad perfect and I loved the muffins. The wait staff was attentive, but not fussy. I wish i had left room for dessert ",4
" I was craving a good steak and the 12 ounce filet mignon satisfied the craving, although it was not very juicy. The bernaise sauce was good.  My wife, not a big meat eater, enjoyed her pork chop.  The drinks were good - a well made martini.  The service was just okay, rather perfunctory in fact.   The noise level was quite high and a little uncomfortable.  All in all, good food and a reasonable experience. ",4
 Waiter never delivered the dessert!    Otherwise a great meal ,4
 Overall great meal! Food was great and the service was stellar. It was however very noisy making conversation difficult at times. ,5
 Great food and the historical decor of the restaurant is a must see! ,5
 All amd bison were incredible. Appetizers are great to. ,5
 Excellent service. Excellent high quality food. Great steak house. ,5
" As we knew the Stockyards had been around for decades we were concerned that it would show it's wear, but it was very elegant without being stuffy.  Great service.  Also food.  Highly recommend it. ",5
 We love the food and food choices on the menu.  But we felt the place was too noisey to carry on a conversation ,4
" We really enjoyed our evening at Top of the Rock-the view was gorgeous, the ambiance quiet and relaxing, and the food exquisite. The crab cocktail was especially memorable, and the Steak Oscar was delicious! All in all, a lovely experience. ",5
 This is one of our favorite spots. We had our wedding dinner for 16 people here 20 years ago to the day...yes this was our 20th anniversary and it was great. ,5
" This was our yearly Girls Brunch. I have not been here since it changed ownership as the Marriott. The food was sparse, to the say the very least. They had no cheese or bread, barely any fruit. An overall disappointing experience.  The only saving grace was that the wait staff was very cordial. ",1
" Fantastic service, great view and architecture. New menu as of about a month ago and food was fabulous. ",5
" The food was wonderful and the service was excellent. The beef was cooked to perfection, the lump crab appetizer was very good. The Top of the Rock salad was also excellent. ",5
 The Ceasar Salad was a D - The bread was hard a C- / - The main course was a B - The mixed drinks were a C- / - The desserts were an A - The service was excellent - The view was outstanding - Would probably not eat here again! ,2
" Food and service were outstanding. The special was pork tenderloin. I asked for mine medium instead of medium well (the default), and it came out exactly right. The accompanying cherry risotto had just enough cherry flavor to pair beautifully with the pork and the red wine demi-glace without overpowering it. The steak Diane was likewise excellent, cooked to a nice medium-rare (closer to rare, actually) and very tender. The accompanying mushrooms were terrific. Desserts didn't miss a beat either. Everybody does lava cakes these days, but this one was very good. The bread pudding, often a total flop elsewhere, was superb: moist, tasty and plentiful. Our server was friendly and attentive without hovering; we'll ask for him again next time. ",5
" Food and service were great, coupled with good company it becomes close to perfect.  Keep up the good work. ",5
" Looking for a great steakhouse in Phoenix. There were many choices, but one of our group suggested the Stockyards. We were not disappointed with the choice. The four of us all chose different main courses and all were excellent. The waiter was very knowledgeable and personable. Will come back. ",5
" Very nice and special place for dining out without being too fancy.   Everyone at the table except me had a filet and the sweet potatoes.  They were a hit.   I had the bison with Bernaise sauce, the potato parmesan stack with truffle butter and asparagus.  I ""won"" dinner - it was really really good. ",5
 This is one of our favorite places to go for a really good steak.  The service is always superb.  The staff is knowledgeable about the food. ,5
" Great menu, Good food, superb service!!! Our waiter, Dan, was excellent. We were in area for vacation and we will go back when in town again. ",5
" always great service and great food--if you love steak, you have to come here.  Everyone at my company loves the prime rib sandwich.  have great salads and non-steak options too ",5
 I loved it ..the Prime Rib was done to perfection. The staff was friendly and polite ..the History of the building was on display along with murals on several walls..it was a wonderful dining experience..i will go back often . ,5
 Excellent food &amp; sercice! We were there on new year's day. ,5
" It was a great experience, we didn't get to see the saloon and our waitress got busy as soon as we were seated so we missed out on the specials. However, that didn't take away from the overall experience, we will most definitely be back for the next birthday we celebrate. ",5
 The prime rib was fantastic.  It was very tender and flavorful/ ,5
" A great classic steakhouse.  I recommend the 16oz Ribeye, it was cooked to a perfect medium rare and tasted great.  Found a good bottle of wine for around $40 and everything else was great. ",5
" As a customer for over 30 years for business lunches and special family occasions - I was disappointed in the service level and the cost of the food.  The Food  has jumped to an inappropriate cost and is not worth the extreme jump in cost compared to the cost of years gone by.  Too bad that you have priced yourselves out of my wallet.  Service was spotty and wait staff was not attentive to our needs - needing to be asked to bring items that should be delivered in a more timely manner. A  sad experience and no longer on my list of ""go to"" places in Phoenix. ",2
" We thoroughly enjoyed our night out to celebrate husband's bday and our anniversary. We hadn't been to the Stockyards since around 2000 and was quite surprised at the changes. Too bad there still isn't a bit of the outside atmosphere that helped give it its name. All staff well groomed , friendly and quite helpful. Everyone did their part to clear the table whenever they saw a finished plate. I appreciated that our server, Alice, would see we had food in our mouths and she didn't stop to ask how we were doing. She would do so only if we were talking . She is an excellant server and I hope she stays another 11 yrs. ",5
 Excellent steaks!  Probably the best steaks we have had in a long time.  I would highly recommend The Stockyard &amp; 1889 Saloon if you are ever in Phoenix. ,5
" A MOST ENJOYABLE EXPERIENCE. FROM THE PAPPY VAN WINKLE AT THE BAR , TO THE BISON STEAK UP FRONT. WHENEVER IN THE AREA AGAIN I WILL BE BACK ",5
" The Stockyards Restaurant is an ""old war horse"" on the Phoenix restaurant scene.  Its been around since there were real cowboys in Phoenix.  Beef is king here and the quality of their beef is extremely high.  Flavors are intense in pieces of meat that are could perfectly.  Side dishes are worthy of exploration, particularly the ""stached parmesean potatoes"" which are more like really cheesy Lyonnaise spuds.  The only course we have never tried is dessert -- there is no room after enjoyng all the prelims and the main course.  Great drinks, OK wine selection.  Waiters are reall on top of their games.  We'll be back. ",5
" Great food, great value with an authentic Southwest feel. ",5
" For an old style elegant ranch-style steak house this is your ticket. Excellent beef cooked precisely right, good wine list and cocktails. Macho mucho all the way. The historic saloon is gorgeous. ",5
" We love the Stockyards!  The food is always great, the drinks are terrific and the wait staff are as good as it gets! ",5
" This was our first visit but many of the other guests waiting for their tables said they had been coming for years and years.  We were seated promptly, the waitress arrived within a minute or two but she unfortunately was very soft spoken and was quite hard to hear due to a table of 5 behind us who talked and carried on as if they were in a stadium.  We were seated in a room adjacent to the bar and the hostess told us this room was quieter than the main dining room. That might normally have been the case except for the folks behind us. If our rating for this visit was based strictly on noise levels our recommendation would have been avoid this place like the plague. Fortunately the food and excellent service completely offset the noise issues that management seemed to be oblivious to.  Once seated our drinks came promptly as did our salads. My friend and I ordered prime rib, his wife ordered a ribeye and my wife the baby back ribs. Of the information the waitress tried to share with us about the history of the restaurant (goes back to the early days of Phoenix when it was more an outpost than a city) we did hear that they still hand cut all of their cuts of meat in house, owing to their having been the main stockyards for what was then still territorial AZ. The prime rib was so tender you barely needed a knife to cut it, the baby back rib meat literally fell off the bones and my friends wife said her rib eye was one of the best she ever had and they are from Texas where beef is king. We will return to the stockyards as a special occasion destination. ",5
 Been here many times before. Waiter went AWOL. My steak was to be rare + but came medium well. Took 10 minutes after requesting the waiter before anyone checked on my issue. ,2
 Excellent as always!  One of our favorite places.  Great place to show some history of Phoenix ,5
" We have been going to Stockyards for years and years!  Every visit has been exceptional.  We have never encountered such a great group of people, everyone here is fabulous.   I had the filet, sister and her husband both had prime rib and my husband had ribs.  We all loved our meals.  We requested our favorite table, which we enjoyed.  The staff congratulated my sister and her husband on having their 45th anniversary and our server offered to take a group photo that turned out really well.  A great time was had by all. ",5
" My party of three had reservations for 6:15PM. We arrived on time and were promptly seated. We had to be at the airport at 8 PM. We told Ron, our waiter of this and he did make our food appear in short order. Two of us had rib eye steaks and the other roasted chicken. Our steaks were cooked properly to our satisfaction. The dining room was quite crowded by the kitchen still got our order out still having time to order three rounds of drinks. The bar scene was lively so we didn't go there first due to the time constraints. The restaurant is a historic place and dozens of historic photographs are on the walls for anyone interested in the Tovrea Feeding Yard that allegedly was the largest cattle feeding yard in the world as I recall. ",5
 Server was mechanical. She was professional and did a great job just not very social. ,5
" My wife and I had a great dinner, the staff and food were great ",5
" Excellent food, steak house prices, as expected. Waited too long for my glass of red wine to drink with my entree, and the restaurant was not busy. My husband was asked what kind of dressing he wanted for his salad, he replied Italian, and the waiter was very curt and replied, we don't have in Italian?? or Ranch? , it was in a tone of , you should know better than to ask for those dressings?  A bit strange to say the least. All in all, very nice restaurant and excellent food, as should be expected for the price point. ",4
 The Stockyards is an old-school steakhouse with all the requisites on the menu.  There is a variety of other as well as signature items very worthy of consideration.  Wait staff is knowledgeable and well trained.  Bar is good; wine list OK.  Prices are in line with other top-rated Phoenix steakhouses.  We'll be back. ,5
 Whipped sweet potatoes were delicious! ,5
" This was the second time we have visited this restaurant, the food is good but not outstanding by our standards.  However, my objection is based primarily on the fact that it is extremely noisy.   We will not return nor will we recommend it to anyone. ",2
" Excellent quality food well prepared. Service was perfect. Water was never empty, we ordered Rib Eye, Filet and Full rack of ribs and each was perfectly prepared. the ancho chile warm brownie with cinnamon ice cream was unique and very tasty. ",5
 Good food and a traditional and historic Steakhouse. ,4
" The stockyards NEVER disappoints. The food is always well-prepared. The steaks are as good as any we've ever eaten - anywhere. Our server - RON, is always welcoming and so attentive. I wish there were more adjectives to describe the food and atmosphere! ",5
" Steaks were good, sides just ok. Not really worth the money. ",3
" We had an anniversary dinner at the Stockyards last year, which was an excellent and memorable experience, and the Chateaubriand was truly exquisite.  This visit was with an old friend and it was underwhelming by comparison to last year, and we don't know why exactly.  The prime rib was mediocre and a bit overcooked.  We had the same server, but there was little interaction and he seemed to be lacking in energy and focus.  He may have just had a bad night, which is understandable, and we will be back regardless. ",3
 Ribeye steaks with steak butter were excellent!  Bison ribeye great flavor.  Parmesion potato stack really good too! The biscuts and the butter were fantastic!  Great piece of Arizona history.  Very nice dining experience.    Thank you! ,5
" Had the Heirloom Tomato Salad, Lamb Belly, and frozen gazpacho. All were amazing. The band that was playing was very pleasant. And the view is always worth coming back for. ",5
" When we want to dine with out of town guests the first place that comes to mind is the Stockyard's.  It is great for showing off ""old-style Phoenix.""  Our four cousins were very impressed and thanked me several times for choosing the Stockyard.  Gary, at the Stockyards was very helpful in setting up the evening exactly how I wanted it.  He filled all my requests. ",5
 The Chateaubriand for two was amazing. Perfectly prepared. ,5
 Have eaten here each year I travel to Phoenix.  Excellent steaks and service.  Highly recommended ,5
 The location near the sky harbor airport in Phoenix was excellent. Loved the decor. Was a bit loud for a Wednesday evening. Very busy at the height of dinner hour. I recommend reservations if you are going at that time. You better be hungry! The portions are large. It is a bit pricey and anniversaries and special occasion appropriate. I will return! ,5
" Had not been here in 15 years, and found it redone, new, and very nice.  Staff was excellent, attentive and very personable.  My dinner, prime rib, was outstanding.  I shared with my wife, who also found it great.  She was not as excited about her filet, but happy with everything else.  Reservations were honored right on time.  Noise level is fine and you can converse in a normal voice.  Every table was busy, so make reservations and enjoy. ",4
 Our waiter Chris Padilla was outstanding!!! ,5
 This was our first time to the Stockyards and it definitely did not disappoint either of us. ,5
" Loved it! My husband and I decided to come here for our anniversary / Valentine's Day dinner. The food was great! I was looking for a new spot for Prime Rib since Monti's closed. This is it. The prime rib was delicious. The sweet potatos were so good too! They start you off with some veggies and a  bread basket which had biscuits and corn bread with a sweet butter that was so yummy! The waiter was very attentive. There were also bus boys that stopped by multiple times to make sure our drinks were full. Again, very impressed with everything about this place. It was a little pricey so I'd recommend this place only for special occasions. ",5
" Best steak I ever had, with the best service. It's very hard to beat this place for quality. I'd recommen to any one. ",5
 Greeted at the door with a pleasant hello. Immediately seated at a very nice table. Waiter staff was very pleasant  and knowledgeable about the menu. Food was exactly how we ordered and was delicious. Had a very relaxing dinner. ,4
" We chose The Stockyard  Restaurant to celebrate our 45th wedding anniversary. We were not disappointed. The wine, the meal, the dessert and our server Alice were wonderful!! Thank you for a memorable time! ",5
" Perfect!  Party of 6, round table requested.  Check!  Quality food, service, ambiance - check, check, check!  Steaks were cooked to perfection, service was impeccable - what more can you ask for?  Highly recommend! ",5
 We went for an early Valentines dinner.  The place was very busy and I'm glad this place is doing well.  The food is always outstanding.  The service was very good.  This is my favorite restaurant when in the mood for beef (steaks/prime rib). ,5
" I hadn't been to Top of the Rock in several years, so glad I went back. The whole staff was excellent! Especially our server Laura, she made some great suggestions, and checked on us several times. To top it all off the chef brought us samples of his favorite desserts, they were delicious and best of all they were on the house! Great view, fantastic food! I will be back! ",5
" My boyfriend and I visited Top of the Rock to celebrate a special anniversary and we were blown away by our experience! First of all, the view is amazing. The sunset is gorgeous with views of both Phoenix and Tempe. We shared a Top of Rock salad with fruit, local feta cheese, walnuts, and a house vinniagrette. For dinner, I got the Scottish Salmon and he got the Filet. We also split a bottle of Vinem Cabernet. Wow! Soooo good! The service was great from start to finish. The server was very knowledgable about the menu. This is definitely a place we want to experience again. Way to go Top of the Rock! ",5
" We enjoyed our selves. There was a snafoo delay with our meal but it was explained and we were compensated with a soup. Things happen, but they were on top of it! The birthday dessert was super, thank you. ",4
 Had a fantastic dinner here with my wife. Can't beat having dinner out on the patio with THE BEST view of the valley at any restaurant! Definitely will be back. Great menu and great ambiance. Live music adds to the atmosphere without being intrusive. ,5
" First time here and was very surprised at the fine food and knowledgable, professional and caring staff. This is trully a rare Phoenix restaurant serving high-quality, gourmet &amp; creative food for people with a sophisticated palate. Dishes are well balanced, creative and use minimal, locally sourced ingrediants. There aren't enough positive adjectives to describe our total experience. I am excited to return for another treat. ",5
" Took my wife for her birthday and from the beginning to the end, it was a great experience. Chef Akos came out to our table and introduced a fabolous salad with all local seasonal ingredients. And the food and ambience were superb. Now that The Buttes has a passionate Culinary team fronted by Executive Chef Gregory Weiner and Chef de Cuisine Akos Szabos, guests should flock to Top of the Rock Restaurant. You will not be let down!! ",5
" My wife and I had a wonderful Eighth Anniversary Dinner, they threw in a delicious dessert on the house for our occasion. The outside Patio was very romantic after dinner to sit and Gaze at the city Lights at night. ",4
" Had friends in from Chicago and decided to check out Top of the Rock at the hotel they were staying at. I dine out alot and Iwas really impressed by the way I was treated from the first moment we walked in. The host was really friendly and took us to the lounge area to have drinks while we waited for our table since there where 7 of us. After about 10 minutes we were seated outside just like we had requested. The manager (Anthony) had to move a couple tables around so that we could sit in front by the fire-pit (thanks)! The view from up there is awesome! we all ordered a bunch of appetizer which were all very delicious and really presented well. We each ordered an entree and passed them around for all to taste. 2 thumbs up, its my new spot! ",5
" great view + great food + great music + great friends + great drinks = GREAT TIME! I never even knew this place was here. My wife and I have been here twice this week alone. Casual,friendly,and the food rocks!!! ",5
" The dinner was very good, but the menu was a little short. ",4
" One of the best Happy Hour's around. Good Drink and food specials. The pork belly poppers are AMAZING. Great up tempo music, service and food to boot. ",5
" We were very disappointed at this restaurant. The menu was very limited and was a bit pricey. The restaurant was cold and we needed to ask that the air conditioning be turned down. We need to change tables to get away from a draft. Background music was loud and bothersome to us. The view was beautiful, but that was all we could positively comment about. We would not recommend this restaurant. ",2
" fabulous food (you HAVE to have the chocolate mousse with the sea salt, you will die), fabulous service (thanks Rachel) Rather pricy ",5
" A limited but excellent menu, a solid wine list, including by the glass, and very interesting happy hour specials make this a very good dining option, not only for those at the Marriott, but also Phoenix residents. The view is to kill for. ",5
" First, I have been coming to the restaurant for years because we frequent the hotel, The dining room was looking a little worn and dated. They added a little lounge area that looks like it is a work in progress but they added some more seating outside which was great. I can also see that they have changed their direction, or chefs, because the food is not so traditional ""hotel food"" but more fun and relaxed. Everything we had was delicous. The portions are smaller but right in line with the smaller prices. I remember paying $30 for scallops before and now they are $18. Overall, I like the direction the restaurant is going, who cares if the server is wearing jeans, it didn't bother us one bit. ",5
" Amazing! Sit outdoors...it can't be beat! Incredible local food items and drinks...service, incredible! I can't wait to go back again!! ",5
" I would not recommend this venue because while our server was great, the music was very loud and upon me requesting to lower it they did however, a good 15 minutes later the music was loud again and hard to have a conversation. There were 3 other tables at 6pm for dinner. The menu is very small and although there is a beef, fish and pork option. Our NY strip and salmon entrees were 25 mins wait time. The server advised of the lateness and I couldn't figure out why our dinners would be late where there were 8-12 other customers in the entire restaurant. They did comply nicely with my birthday dessert request for my out of town friend celebrating her 40th that evening. Over all a nice place, I wouldn't visit again. ",2
" obviously you come for the view. the food was decent, not amazing. but we enjoyed it ",3
" Wonderful food and the view is spectacular. The service was also excellent, but I would recommend a more professional uniform - jeans and a black t-shirt do not cut it for this quality of food and ambiance. ",5
" To start, great scenery. Second, the menu was not what was online, we wanted grass fed steak. The staff was dressed as if they worked in a bar (black shirt and jeans). Next the AC would freeze any Arizonan, but they did promptly turn it off/down when we asked. When our food finally arrived (over an hour from order) the Steak Frite was cold, kudos though because the cottage fries where hot and delicious! The food was excellent for the most part, but expensive for the quality. We were comp'd for dessert because of the cold steak (thank you to the manager). Finally, when we went to retrieve our car, there was no valet and our keys where hanging in the open box. Would we go back, nope not unless things change. ",3
" Second time here in two weeks. Menu is small but everything is extremely tasty. The chef came out and gave us a couple of courses and made a few courses for us and made very personable. The chef made us a couple of dishes not on the menu because we stated we were a repeat guest. Had a great time with an amazing view of the city. The server, Jane, was attentive and knowlegable of the dishes served. A great experience all around. ",5
" The view is fabulous. The food was just ok. Very overpriced for what you got. Not much to chose from the menu, maybe 5 main courses. Only 3 appetizers to chose from. The wine I chose i might of only gotten 1/2 glass. only 3 desserts to choose from so we took off after dinner. We left still hungry after spending over $70 for dinner. Most of the guests were in shorts and t-shirts. Even the staff were in jeans. For the the fact that we were all dressed up for our anniversary and got moderate service, I wouldn't go back. BTW we also went to the Tequila bar under the restaurant and at 7pm we were the only ones there and when we left for our reservation at 8pm still no one was there. The drinks weren't very good either! ",2
 The menu is very limited and the portions are small. ,4
" My wife and I arrived for a nice romantic dinner at the Top of the Rocks Restaurant and were promptly met and seated by our hostess. Initially the restaurant looks quite attractive, once at our table however everything felt a little outdated. The tables were old and wobbly, the decor and motif were plain and unattractive. While they did boast an exceptional wine list at relatively good prices we did not partake in any wine. The Service was great throughout the evening, Mike was very knowledgeable about every. The menu had some great diversity on it. After noticing that the wait staff was wearing jeans we learned that they are trying to become more of a local restaurant and not as fancy, the prices and serving sizes begged to differ. ",3
" Hmmm...I have mixed feelings about our experience. The food was very good. It is an extremely limited menu and that would be an issue for many people - look at the menu online before you go to make sure there is something you like. I was here ten years ago and remember it being WOW! When we went on Friday, April 1, 2011, there was one other couple at the bar downstairs, and the restaurant was practically empty. We thought that was odd as our resort the Arizona Grand was hopping. The place looks tired and dated - they need an update, that is for sure. The servers were very nice and accommodated our request to sit outside. If I go to AZ next year, I won't rush back, which makes me sad. Good, but not as awesome as it could be. ",4
" AMAZING.. New menu, loved the pork belly, Coming back soon ",5
" 25th wedding anniversary dinner. Appetizers were ok. Entrees were just this side of awful. I had the flash cooked scallops with a chili sauce and 'fresh local corn'. Scallops were ok, chili sauce tasted like a cheap bottled barbecue sauce and the corn appeared to be frozen at some point. My wife had the chicken and dumplings, the taste was bland and the chicken was loaded with gristle. We were not going to say anything to our server, but she detected that we weren't happy with our meals. She apologized and explained it was the first night with a new menu.  Prices weren't bad but quality was seriously lacking. Lovely view, offset by ridiculous selection of background music. An odd assortment of '80's and 90's pop. ",2
" The food was great but the menu was limited in terms of choices. Overall, it is great for special occasions, in the case, a romantic birthday. ",4
" Beatiful views, respectful waitors &amp; waitresses. Food is delicous. Took a long time to get to the table this time. Maybe we caught them on a bad night and they were short handed, but not many people there. ",3
 It took more than an hour to get our first course!! Food was good when it came. Veiw is great. ,2
" Was looking for a spot with a nice view for our anniversary night out. Made a reservation and valet parked. The menu is limited and some of the decor is ready for a makeover. THE VIEW IS BEAUTIFUL! Honestly, there was only one other couple in the restaurant when we arrived at 6pm on a Friday night. When we left there were only 4 other couples. This turned out to be a suitable pick! We'll go back again...I hope Marriott will put a few bucks into this location...that could make it a ""10""! ",4
" The view was fantastic!! The food was excellent! There could be less lemon vinaigrette on the kale salad, though. ",5
 The food the last 2 times has been poor to mediocre. ,2
" We thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience at Top of the Rock. The view, the food and the service were all top notch. ",4
" We were very disappointed this time, usually you have a great spread of food, it was crunched in the corner. The person making the crepes burned half of them and we waited 30 minutes to get it so the rest of our food on our plates got cold. I brought another couple so I was quite embarrased that it was not like it usually is. To spend 230.00 I was extremely disappointed. The server was good... but you could tell he was spread thin also. I've always enjoyed coming to the Top of the Rocks, but after this trip I can't say I would spend this kind of money again. I hate to be so negative but I truly was highly disappointed with the food quality and what was offered. Plus they kept running out of things and it took them a long to to restock ",1
 It was a great little place to get away and enjoy the company of friends or loved ones. The food was amazing! The service and staff were great and very friendly! I will return! ,5
 This is beautiful place with some of the best views in the valley. I placed my reservation with open table and asked for a view table. When we arrived the hostess tried to seat us at a table with the view of a pole. We asked for a table with a better view and was given a booth. View OK but 2 tables were available in front of the view window but were told they were reserved. Unfortunately no one sat at these tables for over an hour. Food flavor and presentation is very good. Priced from 36.00 - 39.00 does seem high for what you get. Additional cost for salads. ,4
" A memorable and romantic birthday celebration could have been enhanced by seating us somewhere other than between two chatty females and a large noisy business group, probably done for the convenience of the servers. Food, service, ambience well above expectations; definitely would return for a special occasion despite the distance. ",5
" Will add one more category to the above experience: Price 4 out of 5. But worth what was paid.  I found this restaurant very charming, especially it's location, located at the highest point in Tempe. Service was excellent, though it was rather empty for a Saturday evening. The menu was light however the items they did serve, were done extremely well. I would have to say quality over quantity is their motif.  Would definitely go back and recommend for special occasions or for impressing a date. ",4
 This restaurant was recommended as a place to go in Phoenix. We were very disappointed in the food and it was over priced. The restaurant is located in the Arizona Biltmore and the grounds are beautiful.  I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone who doesn't consume alcoholic beverages. ,2
" Frank and Albert's has a fantastic outdoor eating area. We enjoyed the ambiance with the gas fire pits. We thought the food was excellent, esp the desserts. The wine list had unusual offerings, which we liked. The server was friendly and personable. There were no bus staff to help her however, so she was very busy and couldnt check on us as often as we would have liked. Overall, a wonderful dining experience. We also enjoyed the music in the lobby bar. ",4
 Express Lunch was an excellent value. Great atmosphere. Would definitely return. ,5
 It was my birthday and we had a great meal with excellent presentation and service. The overall effect made it a night to remember. ,5
" Frank and Albert's was fantastic in accomodating our large group on short notice.  The service was a tad slow as a result, but we knew that going in.  The food was amazing and the service was over and above.  It was my 40th birthday and the staff even gave me a gift full of Biltmore goodies and sent chocolate covered strawberries to our room after dinner.  Can't say enough good things about the experience. ",5
 Very well appointed food. Service was great. ,4
 I would definitely go there again. ,5
" My family had dinner on Christmas Eve. The place is lovely and the food is good but not outstanding. We all liked our dinners, but one order of tuna was not warm (sent back ard returned as desired) and an order of sea bass was overdone. The service was good, but the kitchen was very slow. We spent almost two hours for two courses before we had to leave for an event. ",4
" Overall impressions was that the food was really, really good. Other than that it was just an average experience. I had specific instructions put into my reservation on what I wanted and the server did not have the common sense to read the ticket. We waited for about 15 minutes for the server to greet us and take our drink order, and I did not want dessert menus to be given as I had pre-ordered a special dessert as a Christmas suprise. Well the server brought out the dessert menus and ruined the surprise. The ambiance was great, and the new design of the restaurant was impressive, and food so yummy! Service, average at best. ",3
" My sister and I had reservations and were promptly seated upon arrival (there were also no customers in the restaurant). We were then informed of happy hour specials in the bar area and decided to move. Our server was very friendly, accommodating, and helpful. We ordered off of the bar menu which was very similar to the main menu. The food was good but nothing spectacular. The drinks were delicious and decently priced during happy hour. Overall, we were pleased with our dining experience. ",4
 Our luncheon group was celebrating a birthday and it could not have been more lovely. The complimentary birthday dessert was enough to feed 5 and it was delicious. The service by our waitress Victoria was outstanding and could not have been better. Food was delicious as always but this special occasion was over the top wonderful! ,5
" You have to walk thru the crowded bar to get to the restaurant. A jazz band was setting up to play. We had reservationa but for a Friday nite, it wasn't really needed. Onions rings for appetizer &amp; one order was enough for 2 to share. Prime rib was cooked perfectly. The Meatloaf was a little different with pinto beans and spinach but it was moist and flavorful. I would've liked gravy tho. Pumpkin creme brulee for desert was more like pudding than custard and was also very good. Service was awesome. We never had to wait for anything and the waiter was always available, friendly &amp; informative. We never felt rushed and the waiter didn't drop the check til we asked for it.  Valet parking is free if you tell them you ate at the restaurant. ",4
" One of the most pleasant patio dining experiences in Phoenix. Great firepits and fireplaces help keep things comfortable. If you can't sit on the patio, sit towards the back of the restaurant by the firepit. Ask for their delicious bread and aioli dips brought to the table. Delicous sandwiches and salads, extremely reasonably priced, especially considering we're at the Biltmore! Fantastic ambiance! Great desserts too! This is a winner restaurant! ",5
" Will definitely go back and will recommend to all my friends, a very enjoyable dining experience. ",5
" I went to the Thanksgiving Dinner held at Frank &amp; Alberts. The food tasted fine but ws all delivered fairly cold, tepid at best. I asked the waitress if I could have the food warmed and the waitress just brought more of the same cold food in a hot dish. For $50 kind of a rip-off. I wished I had gone to Sizzler instead. ",2
" We went to Frank and Alberts for Thanksgiving dinner, so this review is limited. We didn't realize that we were basically having dinner in the Biltmore coffee shop. Tables were a little too close together, and although we had a reservation, we waited at least 15 minutes for our table. The food was good, though, and our server was excellent; very attentive, especially given the crowd. Next year we'll cook a turkey! ",4
" The variety of the menu and the food was excellent; however, our waiter was very slow in bringing out drinks from the bar. After we placed our drink order, he wandered to the computer and stayed there for minutes, presumably placing our order. However, the bar itself was 10 feet away from our table and it would have been easier and faster had we just gone to the bar ourselves and got our drinks. The waiter was polite, though, but hard to find at times. ",3
" Food was good, nothing spectacular and a few dishes were not hot. Service was poor at best. The hostess was even poor, when we asked if we could move to a different table we were told “you are fine here.“ If you're looking for average food at extravagant prices, inattentive service width an insulting hostess, this is your spot! ",2
 The Biltmore Hotel is a beautiful Hotel and Frank &amp; Alberts is a great restaurant.This is a great place for locals to come to. Do not think it is priced for travelers only. I have been here twice and it is a great local find !!!! ,5
" Disappointing. Pork ribs were tough, meatloaf was bland. Server ignored comments about the food. Timing of service was also off. Drinks took forever, bread came after entrees, etc. Dessert was good. ",2
" I was severely underwhelmed by this dining experience. The food was in my estimation not as good as what one gets at outback steakhouse although it cost significantly more. The waiter was overly intrusive early in our visit and then larely unavailable later. The portions were small, and unbalanced. The deserts were perhapse the most dissapointing. The at your table smores is nothing more than what you would buy at a grocery store (for about $5) on a fancy wooden platter with a flame in the middle and the giant cookie was rough and dry. (you ge a better chocolate chip cookie at subway honestly) Finally, it was hot inside, like someone needed to crank up the air conditioner. I was actually sweating at one point. ",2
" We were excited to try this place a second time based on how much we enjoyed it the first time. Disappointment to say the least. Service was slow with a few mistakes on our friends drinks. Food, when it finally arrived, was a mix of mediocre. The ribs I had were literally half fat and gristle and you had to hunt for the meat. The savior for it was the great bbq sauce and beans. Our friends had equally lack luster dishes so we will not be coming to this place again. ",2
" The food and service were outstanding. Waitress was very helpful in making food selection. The decor of the restaurant was inviting and pleasant. Many of the customers chose outdoor seating, but we preferred the inside. Food was served quickly and efficiently. Would recommend Frank and Alberts to friends visiting Phoenix.W ",5
" Always a favorite of ours. Really enjoyed the cheese, mac &amp; the chicken. The burger is now on a sourdough kaiser roll vs. English muffin and very good. Was disappointed though in that they removed my favorite dessert off the menu, but they do offer a good selection of other desserts. It's nice to come to this restaurant on a special occasion for unique comfort food dishes. Thanks. ",4
 We love coming here to sit outside and to get the S'mores for dessert however we had a very long wait for our entrees (1 hour) which I normally don't mind if we are having a salad but we had our 2 kids with us and they can't normally sit for 1 hour and wait for their food. There were quite a few large parties seated right after us so I suspect that was the problem but it was disappointing. ,2
 The food was good and the service was good - but it took a long time to get our food. Another mentioned that he had the same experience during the conference. ,3
 We had a large group and they accommodated us with no issues. The appetizers were great...especially the Brie. Dinner was overrated but competently done. The location is pretty spectacular and the prices were reasonable. ,4
" Everything was fine. It is time, however, to update the menu, please. ",4
" Dining on the patio with the fireplace is magical, but it's a shame the food is only so-so. We decided on ordering appetizers after reading a review, but that was a mistake.  The Flash-fried calamari was just ok and came out warm/cold, the flatbreads which sounded delicious on the menu were bland, doughy (undercooked) and cold. Not ""flat"" and not ""grilled"" or crispy at all. I think the best thing that was ordered was the warm-brie appetizer, the sliders from the kids menu and the french fries. Also, the make-them-yourselves smores for dessert for cute for the kids. Disappointed. ",2
 took 55 min to get our lunch. Hotel knows the level and nature of its in-house mix of guests. should plan for this volume with this knowledge. I had the same problem at this restaurant last year. Food was average ,1
 one of my best restaurant since a long time in the USA.Price are low and all is No:1 ,5
" Excellent all around! Forget about Wright's,the restaurant next door to this one...this is the place to visit! ",5
 Always great! How about some new soups on the menu? ,4
" Always great. It would be nice to have some new items on the menu, such as soups and real beef meatloaf. ",4
" The food was very good, but the aspect of Frank and Alberts that makes this restaurant stand out is the service. The wait staff did an incredible job, made us feel welcome and were very attentive while not being intrusive. ",4
 It did not live up to our expectations. Being at the Arizona Biltmore we expected a better dining environment. More refined and less bar bistro. ,3
" Service was excellent, shame about the food. No wow flavours from the promised organic ingredients came through, rather the food was bland. Pears in my wife's dessert were unrioe and rock hard as if frozen. ",3
" Visited with a group of friends during happy hour. The ""Hi-Five"" special is a great value. The $5 appetizers were also good. Drinks were hit-or-miss (the ""Lavender and Lemons"" cocktail was fantastic). For a first-time visitor, getting to the restaurant can be a bit of a challenge, as it's located within the Arizona Biltmore Resort. Once you find the resort, then it's just off the lobby area. ",3
 Another Arizonia gem. We had an amazing lunch and dinner here. Crisp perfect fries. Fresh salads drinks to remember with a smile. Our service was outstanding. A great view. Comfortable seating. ,5
" Great food! I had the waldorf salad &amp; pork empanadas. The pork had a wonderful flavor. The salad was light and refreshing. My companion had the carb free tacos which normally come with lamb. The staff substitited chicked with no hesitation and the result was delicious. I feel that they put as much effort into the seasoning of the chicken as they would have for the original recipe. A lot of restaurants have a good staff and nice ambiance (as F &amp; A's did), but when the food is right on, that's what makes it a a winner! ",5
 Fish over cooked and sauce not on it. Sides were cold and skimpy   Way seared stared at heat lamp on pickup station. Can’t believe how long food sat there!  Over 15 minutes for some dishes. ,2
 Our service is for sure a 5 Star experience for friends whom hasn't seen each  other for over 10 yrs. ,4
" Lovely place.  We were able to dine out on their patio in the evening. They made sure we were placed by the gas firebowl and heater.  Beautiful evening and great service.  Our server ""R.J."" was outstanding. ",5
 Wonderful spot to get a bite to eat at the biltmore.   More casual than Wright’s    Easy with kiddos and excellent service.  .    Open kitchen and super cool sunroom sitting area. ,5
" We didn't eat a lot for breakfast/brunch, but what we had was very good! Lovely mixed fruit plate (not so generic) and tasty chicken sausages, and husband enjoyed his omelette with yummy potato galette. Nice, semi-outdoor seating with prompt service. (Always a nice location for a walk-around as well!) ",5
 Great food and excellent service ,5
 I felt the price for the food we ordered was just so-so.  Not awful but certainly not good value for the price.  Our waitress started out friendly but did not come back to retrieve our plates or ask if we wanted anything else.  Not worth it! ,3
 We were a party of four... each of us thought our meal was FABULOUS  Thank you ,4
" The patio is a perfect spot for dinner or drinks. The dining room was crowded and loud - we had requested to move seats outdoors and our group was so happy we did. The patio was a lovely setting with a great ambiance. At times we felt we were forgotten by the server - but we weren't in a rush, so it all worked out. ",4
" Both my steak (ribeye) and my wife's steak (strip) were not very good.  It is advertised as prime but I can not imagine that is true.  They were cooked perfectly medium rare.  The sauce was good but the steaks themselves were chewy and tasteless.  They tasted like Select where there is not enough marbling of fat.  I'm surprised at such a price point.  The waitress was very good, wished I remembered her name. ",2
" Great food, service and ambiance.   Things that were great: hummus plate, burger,  soup of the day, salads....all great.   Not but not least end dinner with a fun offer of s’mores! ",5
 Service was slow. We waited at least 15 min to even be greeted by a server and that was after we contacted a manager. Food was really good and the patio is a great setting. Just a little surprising that it took nearly 30 min to get our first drink before dinner. ,4
 Lovely posh atmosphere. Breakfast buffet will not disappoint. Made to order omlet was scrumptious! Servers attentive! ,5
" Nice, comfortable well served with good food. Noise level was high. A good casual place for friends. ",4
" Overall outstanding place for lunch, cocktails and dinner. We have celebrated Valentines, Thanksgiving and Christmas over the past couple of years. We have always had a nice experience for these special celebrations. Some of the waitstaff remember us by name and one sent us a gift of chocolates the day after we were served by her. We recently had only had one undesirable interaction with a waiter which is probably just odds and human nature catching up with us. When we shared our concern with a manager, he gave us a $100 food credit which we appreciated very much. We will come back to dine here whenever possible. ",4
" Have been to Frank and Alberts before with a good experience, this time , for Christmas dinner, not so much.  Had to go to hostess table to get a server to come to us. Not even a greeting from a server for 10 minutes or more... buffet was marginal. For the price per person, it should have been at least close to exceptional.  Dissapointing  tonight. ",2
 Christmas Day Brunch ,5
 Couldn't sit outside because they were filming something. Sat by a window but view wasn't as good. ,5
 We decided to eat here after flying across Country and checking into the Waldorf. The restaurant was slow and got much busier then we think they had planned for. Our food came out before the kitchen got really busy and the pizza and salad were both excellent. The services was friendly and attentive early and friendly and apologetic later when the restaurant got busier. We did not see anyone that resembled a manager pitching in to help out. ,4
" the meal was mediocre at best, the wait staff nice, but slow. ",2
 RJ was an incredible server!  We learned things about the hotel/resort/and surrounding areas that we never knew even though we live in the area!  He made the night a great and memorable experience! ,5
" We, as a group of friends / former co-workers of many years, went to celebrate Christmas as we do every year.  It's always decorated so nicely for the holidays.  Food was excellent,  service was excellent, and it was beautiful, as it always is. ",5
" We had a nice lunch and our salads were really exceptionally good.  However, this restaurant does not have any ambience at all.  It is just tables and booths.  Of course, the hotel grounds and lobby are spectacular, but this restaurant does not match it. ",3
" Good food, pleasant surroundings and great service.  I would recommend this place to my friends. ",5
" The ambiance of the Waldorf Astoria is wonderful.  We chose to eat outside at Frank &amp; Alberts.  That was our mistake.  The seat cushions were dirty and dusty, and the birds were more than annoying.  It probably wouldn't have been so bad if our server had been more attentive to our table as well as the table next to us.  The gentleman dining alone had to move his finished plate away from himself, because the birds were trying to get to it.  When the server still didn't remove the plate and birds started showing up in swarms - think Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds - he got up picked up the plate himself and moved in into the covered area of the patio away from our tables.  Our server came to our table only twice and that included the time she took our order and then to give us our bill.  Neve received water refills or checked on to see if we needed anything else or if our meals were satisfactory.  Thankfully they were.  Also, the buffet is the best value if you are looking for a basic omelet/egg breakfast. ",4
 This was a great place to be. Beautiful ambiance with great food! We really enjoyed getting the whole family together in an inviting and warm space for Thanksgiving. Food was top notch and no clean up :) ,5
" Ate here for the TG holiday. I always give folks a pass on the holiday, so giving it 3 stars, not 2. Not up to Waldorf snuff. Food was ok. The tortilla soup was good, but it came out 20 minutes earlier than my husband's soup.  Did the buffet for the holiday. Food was decent but was barely warm. Our waiter came by often but never cleared any plates. He kept rushing us to the buffet, trying to get us to get our mains before we got our soup, etc.  we had our menus and two courses finished with plates still on the table. He asked it he could drop the bill when my husband ordered coffee. When he brought the coffee, he told us it was the last cup and he was brewing another and he could get us to go cups with the fresh batch. The stale cup was full of coffee grounds. We were so disappointed, we just tabbed out and left since he kept hurrying us.  Was a $230 tab for fixed price meal, wine, coffee and auto-grat.  Was disappointed because it was also our anniversary. ",2
 Three of us went there for the Thanksgiving buffet. Two had the buffet and one ala cart. Good food. Great service. ,4
 Took 3 tries to get the coffee hot. Turkey &amp; prime rib were great. Not too crazy about the Salmon. Derserts were fun. ,4
" We went of the Thanksgiving ""prix fixe"" buffet and were not disappointed. While a more casual set up, the food was still excellent as was the service ""Z"" was amazing and made us feel at home. And the desserts!!! Worth NOT having a second helping (hard to pass up the buttermilk mashed potatoes) and loading up a full-sized plate with all the sweet goodies. A great place, in a great location, on a great day. ",5
 We loved Emanuel. He was very patient with my father who has Alzheimer's and had a passion about what he does.  Not a lot employees have that focus nowadays. Make sure you harness his talent. It is very rare. ,5
 Specifically came for brunch ergo an 1045 reservation ideal. They shut down the brunch buffet at 11. Staff was awesome and as accommodating as could be upon realizing the situation. ,3
" Every month I love to sit out on the patio with friends and order my favorite salad the F&amp;A salad. Only found at this restaurant. If it gets too chilly they will turn on the fireplaces. Sit out by the fire, listen to the fountain. Great service. ",5
" Food was just okay and the service was very slow.  Waited forever for server to come back and settle our checks.  Quite noisy location, conversation difficult. ",3
" The food was great but the service wasn't. Our appetizer, salads and entree were served within one minute of each other. I was at the Biltmore but thought I was at Dennys. ",3
 We frequent this restaurant while staying at the Biltmore for vacation.  The menu has changed since we were there three years ago and is now very inventive while keeping our favorites (the meatloaf w/mashed).  Also there is the ability to downsize the portions which is highly desirable when on vacation so that there are no leftovers.I️ love the new salads and the wine list is very good.  Very friendly staff...we love staying at the Biltmore!! ,5
" The F&amp;A salad, absolutely the best ever. Service was great. Outdoor patio a must. ",5
" My wife and I went to Frank and Alberts on a special date. Though pricey, the food and ambiance were worth it. We had an excellent dinner on their outdoor patio. Our server, Troy, gave us some great recommendations. ",5
" This was a real disappointment. The food was mediocre, but as important, the food was served before we had even started drinking our cocktails. Very expensive and not good. ",2
" Outdoor seating was very enjoyable. However, staff was mediocre at best (seemed distracted and aloof) and between the cold salmon dish and dirty glasses I can't give this place more than 3 stars. And 3 because of the outdoor seating.  Not at all what I expected from a Waldorf hotel, quite disappointing. ",3
" We were seated swiftly and loved the breakfast menu -- nice twists and takes on classics, and some luscious specialties...almost got a smoke salmon and capers breakfast pizza but built and omelette instead. Nice Frank Lloyd Wright influence settings and touches. Relaxed unhurried meal, and all sorts of non-server folk seemed to stop and ask if everything was satisfactory. ",4
" It was our first visit and my husband and I were both impressed with the intimate, cozy fireplace atmosphere. The service was friendly and their recommended wine selection was paired nicely with our prime rib dinners. We will definitely be coming back! Our server, Kenneth, did a great job. ",5
" Sit outside by the fireplace, and finish dinner by toasting marshmallows and making s'mores. If you are on vacation from the frozen north, you will be happy you did! ",4
" This was our second attempt at a good meal and F &amp; A and again left disappointed. The food at this restaurant is mediocre - unremittingly mediocre - and the pleasant, helpful wait staff does not offset it. ",3
" Prime rib prepared very well- steak and crab cake came out cold- server was responsive, and a fresh and hot plate of food arrived although it took a bit of time ",3
 The Menu Selection meets the expectation for all ages. Accessible for wheel chairs and walkers. New Year's Eve dinner was a great start to the Symphony. ,4
" We were celebrating my mother's 89th birthday. Altho it was in October, this was her first visit to AZ since her birthday. We had a great table in a glass enclosed room allowing us to see the lovely Biltmore gardens. There was a fire in the fireplace. The food was delicious. Our waiter, formerly of El Paso, was excellent. We were offered a complimentary dessert for mother's birthday and chose the yummy tableside somemores. Of course the icing on the cake, so as to speak, was how beautifully the Biltmore was decorated for the holidays. It was the perfect lunch outing! ",5
" Although we had made our reservation a couple of days ahead, we were seated in the corner of the glass room, behind a pillar, with no view of anything. We asked for another table, or to be seated in the lounge, but were told there were no available tables. The server was very nice, which almost made up for the terrible table. The lavender martini and deep fried mac and cheese were excellent, but my entree was just odd. The Biltmore hotel is historic and very interesting, but our dining experience was not what we had hoped. ",3
" Both of our linen napkins were soiled. Also, it took over 5 minutes for our waitress to arrive. She said that she wasn't told that we were seated. Otherwise, food quality was average. I would expect better food for such a classy resort! ",3
" THE SPECIAL WAS RACK OF LAMB AND WAS GENEROUS, HOWEVER LAMB WAS NOT RENDERED AND RUINED THE TASTE. ",3
" Sat by the kitchen which was a bit too loud, otherwise and excellent meal and expierence. ",4
" Christmas Eve dinner was a disappointment. Service had been slow in years past so we made our reservation for 5:30 p.m. to comfortably make a 7:30 engagement. We were still pushed for time and skipped desert. The table we were offered was across from the kitchen and seemed too noisy. We tried sitting outside, but it was too cold. We have eaten here for many years and really like the idea of coming on Christmas Eve. The Biltmore is near our home and is lovely. I don't think we will try Christmas Eve again. My wife's rack of lamb was very generous but came whole and was hard to seperate into chops. My hamburger was way over done even though I ordered it medium rare. Two others had salmon which they thought was OK but dull. ",3
" they have an excellent happy hour selection at the bar, and everything we ordered, from the salad to the entrees to the desserts were excellent. one of my favorite places to go for a special occasion ",5
 Overall is was a wonderful dining experience. One thing worth mentioning is that the wait people (ours) should not crouch down on their haunches and come so close to the diners when taking the order or discussing the menu. He was polite but the crouching down and being in so close was rather off-putting. ,4
 We totally enjoyed the simple but well prepared dinner and excellent service. ,5
 Food was uninspiring and a very limited selection. ,3
 Wonderful place to meet friends and family. The staff was over the top in helpfulness and friendliness. The outdoor area is beautiful and worth the visit. We had brunch. The price was reasonable but the food quality was no better than a chain restaurant. Needs work. ,4
" The restaurant was not that full on Thanksgiving. Despite this fact we were seated well within the restaurant, right next to the server terminal where waiters enter their orders. All of the servers using this terminal must have thought there was a brick wall in between them and where we were sitting; we could hear everything they were talking about from how much they were being tipped (or not) to one waiter's challenge to abstain from using alcohol outside of work to a certain unnamed celebrity who visited that night. It took them 10 minutes to greet us once we were seated, food was okay. Our waitress actually lied to us about some rolls that were supposed to come with the dinner (said they ran out when they didn't). Not worth a $150. ",2
" The service was not great. The waiter came on strong but then forgot about us. At least ten mins. between end of meal and dessert/coffee served; dessert came with no forks. Lots of junior servers but no supervision by head waiter. A disappointment, esp. at Thanksgiving. ",3
" My date and I went for Thanksgiving dinner and were kind of skeptical how the meal would go being a fixed holiday menu but were excited about not having to cook or clean. We were blown away by the excellent and cheerful service, the gorgeous (and private!) outside dining area in which we were seated, and delicious cocktails and family style food. We would definitely come again for a holiday or regular meal. ",5
" Went there for Thanksgiving Day Dinner, I expected more for $45.00 for one plus tax &amp; tip. The salad was very good &amp; the pie was excellent the dinner was just so so. nothing special The butter was hard as a rock could not spread it. The rolls a little dry and I had to ask for gravy. Just sloppy or they could care less. Next Year I will go to Ruth Chris. ",3
" I was visiting Scottsdale with my friend from London. We had a wonderful experience at this restaurant thanks in part to the terrific food and even more terrific service by our waitress, Sherri. We enjoyed the macaroni and cheese bites starter - very light and delicious. The fish tacos were divine as was the crepes suzette dessert that we shared. Highly recommended lunch at Frank and Albert's and then a walk around the Biltmore grounds ",5
" The tortilla soup was excellent. Short rib good. Mac 'n Cheese and the Chicken poor - especially in light of the fact it was the nightly special and touted by the server as a fan favorite that had recently returned to the menu due to high demand. Chicken was dry and mac n cheese was below ordinary. Huge disappointment. The restaurant holds promise due to style and location, will probably give it a second chance. ",3
 I enjoyed our first year anniversary at Frank and Alberts at the Arizona Biltmore. We were married there and the ambiance was incredible! ,4
 Our experience was based on the fact that it was not crowded. Enjoyed a glass of wine and bread sitting by the fire pit on a cool fall evening. Everything was great. I recommend! ,5
 so disappointed that the meatloaf which 3 of us were salivating for after we were told that it was baked and then sliced and grilled -- came out covered up with a chiptole (i think) type sauce -- spicy and overpowered the taste of the meat completely. very disappointing. thought the service was very mediocre after a great presentation by our server as he spoke about the different items on the menu. it went down from there...... ,2
 We had a great breakfast on this date. The service and food are always great at the Biltmore! I love bacon! ,5
" My date ordered an appetizer and soup as her meal. The waiter brought it out early. Considering that this restaurant is at the Biltmore, I hold the waitstaff to a higher standard than, say, Applebee's, and this is unacceptable. The waiter made a point of telling me that he was able to get me the last prime rib - at 7pm?? Sounds like they need to plan better. There's a disproportionate amount of pork entrees on the menu. My date did comment that the tortilla soup had a lot of tortilla and very little chicken. I don't think she was too thrilled. I had higher expectations for a place that was voted best new restaurant. I might go back on a Thursday for the pork loin. Otherwise, can't think of a reason to go again. ",3
 Really enjoyed my dinner! The wait staff was attentive and the food was delicious. The celery ceasar salad was great! ,4
" our waiter was wonderful and very attentive. the food was interesting, perfectly cooked and wonderfully tasty. ",5
" I was very disappointed by our meal at Frank and Albert's. The waiter did not respond to our requests. We asked that the pizza be served without cheese, and there was cheese. We asked for a side of fries, and we are still waiting. It wasn't terribly busy, but he seemed distracted. I had heard amazing things about this place, but was very disappointed. ",2
" We really enjoy F&amp;A. This was our second time there. Both times were for my wife's birthday. One of the reasons we came back was b/c last year they had this fabulous buffet for the Labor Day weekend-my wife's birthday. Every part of the buffet was incredible! We thought we would enjoy the same thing this year but to our disappoint they didn't have one. Still enjoyed our dining experience ordering from the menu &amp; the food was delicious. They pride themselves on making sure your food is just how you want it cooked and expect it to taste. Another reason we came back was b/c they made my wife's b-day so special. Literally, from the moment we walked hin she was treated like royalty.Difference was that last year I reserved directly w/ restraunt. ",4
" Glad we had reservations...taken right in.... Services was great! Actually provided a printed recipe card with dipping sauces for their bread. Fries poached in duck fat, were excellent, crispy and delicious Their take of the Waldorf salad with spinach was wonderful, a hint of lemon, crunch of nuts and thinly sliced apples served over a lovely bed of spinach....yummy.  Great choices of beers, wine and martinis..... menu rotates, so drinks and choices change. Much fun! ",5
" Lunch at the Biltmore was wonderful. Customer service by entire staff was A plus. Food was good but what made our afternoon was the conversation my husband and I had with Jim. Jim knew a lot of things about the area, things to do, Frank Lloyd Wright and the sprites making our experience an excellent one. F&amp;A thank you for a memoriable experience. ",5
" Seems like the menu was limited becasue it was summertime. More options would have been nice. Overall food was good,would have liked more choices. ",4
 The food was amazing and the staff took service to an extremely high level. ,5
 My husband and I brought my parents for brunch. ,3
 service was ridiculously slow. manager gave us 30% off but and pizza's were miserable ,1
 Food not up to expectations of AZ Biltmore level dining ,2
" A great place for excellent food. Relaxed, family friendly, yet casually elegant. A true oasis in the summer for a yummy experience! ",4
" Great ambience- I thinkk they recently changed menu; Had the ribs- was dried out and no flavor! Great place, but food is def subpar ",2
 It was a great Experience. The Manager Matt Case introduced himself and made sure everything was perfect. I would recommend it highly to anyone. ,5
 Frank and Alberts and our entire Biltmore staycation were fantastic!! We will do it again!! ,5
" We had the buffet, probably the mistake....everything else was very nice, food either undercooked or over overcooked. Service was great, nice seating options, wine was very good. I would go back, just order differently....nice casual environment. ",3
 the service and food was excellent. beautiful hotel and restaurant. ,5
" We were seated as requested with our Open Table reservation. We were participating in the May 2011 Arizona Restaurant Week promotion. I was the only person of the four diners to have the $40.00 three course special. Overall, the service was slow and unattentive even though the restaurant was only have full. The food was fine, but not extraordinary to make us rave or say that we would come back again. There are better places to dine in the greater Phoenix area for better food and service. It was a rather disappointing meal. ",2
" There were a few minor mess-ups with our orders (in a party of 6, 3 people initially received the wrong entrees), but otherwise the food here is amazing. The baked goat cheese is creamy and a very unique dish; their desserts are gigantic, especially the ice cream samplers that come in champagne glasses. ",4
" I would have given Five Stars for the quality, preparation and presentation of my meal. However the unfriendly service I experienced the bar and from my server made my experience here a dissapointment. It's a shame because the ambiance and atmosphere are great. The bartender and server barely were not the least bit personable and barely managed a smile. Maybe it was because we were there for Arizona Restaurant Week and they weren't expecting a lot of spend from us. A real dissapointment in any case. I would not go back. ",3
" We had a wonderful dinner on the patio. The food was outstanding. It was ""comfort"" food, but quite a bit better than the ""blue plate special"". We went for ""restaurant week"", but there were so many other good things on the menu that we each tried something different. I thought the price was very reasonable as well. ",5
 We have dined here several times and find the food consistantly good and the service friendly and attentive. ,4
" the buffet was SO unimpressive! It was small, food quality was not great... what a waste going there. I was expecting a beautiful mother's day, and an extravagant buffet, wonderful food. Not So!! ",2
" We went to Frank and Albert's for the first time to celebrate Mother's Day. We opted for the brunch instead of the 3 course lunch / dinner. The brunch was good but not great. The choices, while tasty, were few. The omelet chef had a very difficult time keeping up with the orders and there was consistently a line of people, waiting for their omelet. Normally this would not be a problem, but due to the placement of the omelet station, it made it impossible to access the rest of the buffet. The staff also needed to be consistently told that items needed to be replenished. I know that Mother’s day is always a busy restaurant day, but you need to staff accordingly. Would like to try it again on a less busy day. ",4
" Went for Mothers day, the buffet was not that great. ",3
" We loved everything about our visit to Frank &amp; ALbert's. The food was superb. We started with the pork empanadas and they were dynamite! I had the filet and my husband had the Friday pork rib special. The filet was prepared just right and was so tender I could cut it with my butter knife! We had our three year old with us and she had a great time too. There was live dinner-type music on the patio that was very enjoyable (not too loud and pretty tame) We finished the night with butterscotch pudding (yum!) and gelato for the little one, Our server Rachel was excellent. We will definitely be back. ",5
" We went for a late afternoon Easter dinner with three adults and a 7-year-old boy. We sat outside in the covered area of the patio near the fire pit. It was a good spot, since we could see the lawn chess game, avoid the visiting birds on the open patio and bask in the heat from the fire pit, since it was a bit chillier in the shade. They offered a lamb chop for the Easter prix fixe and my husband and dad enjoyed it. I had the lemon chicken and mashed potatoes. This is a comfort food place, but they do it with style. My son had the mac &amp; cheese with a side salad. We come here often for special occasions, since the service is attentive without being overbearing. The server suggested the make-your-own Smores for dessert and it was a big hit. ",4
 Service on Easter was marginal and our server must have been exhausted by 2:00 pm. Poor attitude and unfriendly. Eventually she went off shift we were told and had another server. ,2
" Love this place. This is our favorite for Easter, Mothers Day and Fathers Day brunches when we don't eat here for our own great date night. Not as formal as the other Builtmore restauraunt but the servers and food is just as good and has a bit of a more comfortable atmosphere for every age. ",5
 We thoroughly enjoyed our breakfast at Frank and Alberts! It was a pleasurable dining experience and great atmosphere. We will definitely return! ,5
" We were staying at the Biltmore and were excited to see Frank and Albert's rated so highly. We made reservations weeks in advance for our first night's stay and were pretty disappointed with the meal. My 10 year old summed it up, Dad, I think it's really pretty here but I wish you had cooked my dinner. The food used was obviously fresh but over prepared. ",3
 The bar in front was really hopping and we were relieved that the restaurant was much more subdued. Service was very good but the food was just okay. Not great but they had interesting cocktails. ,3
" We were terribly disappointed by the service, and the food. The server was inexperienced and didn't know the menu enough to answer basic questions. The meatloaf was like pate, and the turkey tasted ""pumped"" or processed. We went for our 25th wedding anniversary, and told the restaurant that when my husband made the reservation. It was to be a surprise for me. There was no mention of doing anything special for our occasion, or even a note made to wish us well when we came. Overall, a major let down. I spoke to a manager yesterday who was going to get in touch with me yesterday afternoon via email to make this right, and he hasn't as of now. Another disappointment. ",2
" Lovely patio, everyone was very nice and accomodating. Food quite good.Can't wait to return. ",5
 Frank &amp; Albert's provided a wonderful dining experience. We sat in the outdoor courtyard and enjoyed the open fireplace and water fountain. The food was very inventive and delicious. We truly enjoyed our evening there. ,5
" After reading all the rave reviews for this restaurant we were very disappointed because our overall experience was less than desirable. I had the Pork Chop which was very dry and my girlfriend had the Meatloaf which was bland. On top of that the service was poor, which I don't understand since the restaurant wasn’t very busy. The only upside was the atmosphere which was very nice. ",2
" I was really looking forward to eating here because the reviews were so good and was incredibly disapointed. The service was awful, it took half an hour to get drinks and the bread was brought to our table as we were finishing our meals. Also, my mother asked repeatedly for someone to light our candle because the lighting outside was poor and she couldn't read the menu, even asking what appeared to be a manager and finally a busboy lit it in time for dessert. For a restaurant that is supposed to be known for ""comfort food"", the portions were really small. The menu looks amazing, but the entrees were underseasoned and bland. The roll that my husband's burger came on was so hard, he didn't bother to eat it. Awful experience. ",1
" This is not meant to be a bad review, it's just that we found the reviews on yelp and TripAdvisor to be a bit over the top. The food was fine, but nothing special. The ambience, save for the loud-mouthed woman a few tables away and the parents letting their kids run all over (neither of which are the fault of the restaurant) was very pleasant, especially with the fires burning to take the evening chill off. The service was great, until our waiter became infatuated with the blonde at the next table, after which we became invisible. It took spearate actions on our part to get the table cleared, the dessert menu, and ultimately the check. The Biltomore is not to be missed, and made our journey worthwhile. ",3
 It was absolutely fabulous. Best food I've had in my life. ,5
" Sitting outside for breakfast really starts a day off well. The setting here is beautiful and the food is wonderful. Many different choices. The Ranch Tower was excellent. Our server did a wonderful job. He was well informed about the menu items, checking with us throughout the meal without being intrusive. ",5
 Stunning gardens and architecture and a solid menu with options for all tastes - Frank and Alberts is my favorite business lunch choice. ,5
" We did not like this place at all. Others had raved about this place in their reviews so we had high hopes, but we were disappointed. The mac &amp; cheese barely had any cheese or maybe cheese with no flavor. The chicken was very dry. Our sweet potato fries sat under the warmer for 10-15 minutes before they served them. We were hoping for fine dining at the beautiful and high class Biltmore, but all we got was a mediocre restaurant in a hotel. The service was outstanding though. ",2
 I have been dining a couple of times a month at Frank &amp; Albert's since it opened about a year and a half ago and have thoroughly enjoyed it until going there for dinner two nights ago. Started with the roasted tomato soup that tasted and had the mouth feel of diluted tomato paste. The meatloaf that I have enjoyed many times was fine but the portion was much smaller than before. One of my companions stopped after two spoons of the soup and was also disappointed with the portion size of the meatloaf. Though uncrowded on a Saturday night the service was listless. And to boot when I got the check the server had added his gratuity without mentioning it to us. I am used to this latter practice for a party of 6 or more but we were only 4. I will g ,2
 We had a great brunch with very solid service. ,4
" Boring, uneventful resort restaurant. ",2
 Great food in a lovely setting...try outdoors on the patio....Very unexpected to find a restaurant like this in a hotel setting...it is clearly not your father's hotel restaurant! They have gluten free items marked on the menu in cluding gluten free flats &amp; pizzas...with homemade (not frozen) dough. ,5
 Food was very good w/ regional favorites. Service and food delivery a bit slow even though it was not too crowded. ,4
" Had booked for brunch with niece and husband; way too noisy, looked and felt like a coffee shop. Moved to Wright's next door, elegant, what we were looking for. ",2
 Our luncheon on Friday was quite good. ,3
" I wish I knew how a restaurant could go so wrong. The staff is willing and enthusiastic. I had a lunch and a dinner there. The lunch took forever. I loved how the menu read, but nothing stood out in the tasting. This is a typical hotel restaurant at best. ",2
" Seated promptly (party of 10) and drink orders were taken quickly. Atmosphere was convivial within the clean, contemporary decor. Server was attentive and knowledgeable. Kitchen did a great job and our evening flowed seamlessly. Until time for our checks. It took far too long to settle our bill. Hopefully this does not happen frequently ",4
 We celebrated my mom's birthday and had a great evening! The service was excellent and the outdoor fire pit was beautiful! Thank you! ,4
 I have been to Grassroots several times now and enjoyed every time that I go. Love the burgers and fries. ,5
" Had friends in from Houston and went by Grassroots on our way to the airport, there was a group of 8 and the service was great and food was super! ",5
" Good neighborhood spot, relaxed environment. Food choices were ample however disappointed with the service aspect.  Lovely ambiance. ",3
 We started coming to this restaurant throughout the winter to enjoy their soups.  The food is very fresh tasting here.  Desserts are amazing.  Staff have always been great no matter who we encounter.  This is our go to spot when company is in town. ,4
 Wonderful...from burrata app to scallop special to root beer float and banana split...everything was delicious. Service was very friendly and efficient. ,5
 Disappointed in the service.  Food came out cold.  One entrée was incomplete.  Had to make multiple requests for water. When water came it was Sprite. They were not busy. Needed a spoon for two of the orders but we had to ask for a spoon. ,1
" This was my 3rd visit in 6 months to Grassroots.  On previous visits the food and service were excellent.  On this visit - St Patricks Day during high season in Phoenix - the server took our order and neglected our table the entire evening.  No one, including other servers/bussers, offered to refill water.  We enjoyed our food but they didn't even give us an opportunity to buy additional wine or beer past our initial seating.  I will not return - at least during high tourist times. ",3
" Fresh Farm to Table, deliciously prepared, and something for everyone in the family! ",5
" We had a great time trying this place for the first time. The food was great, the service was fast and friendly.  The outdoor seating was great and provided a nice touch to a great  dining experience. ",5
 The short ribs were amazing! ,5
" Grasssroots is our go to restaurant when we have out of town guest who are looking for ""fresh and tasty"" dishes. ",4
" The food was incredible, the best appetizers.  We had the pork belly  and tuna poke, both were delicious however the pork belly was the best I have ever had.  Entrees were wonderful, I have recommended this great dining experience to all my friends.  Hats off to the chefs!! ",5
" this  is not fine dining  but  iy is wonderful,      this is a classic  bistro  or like  the brits  use  to say  Pub,  however the good is absolutely terrific  and the service is young  and energetic.   very good value and one of or favorites  bravo  American bistro ",4
" We had a really good time. Dining on the patio was very relaxing. I had the short ribs on the servers suggestion. Wonderful, loved the grits! The server, by-the-way, was outstanding. Took extra time to take us through all the choices and was attentive throughout. We will be coming back again. ",4
" I love this place. This is my 2nd experience and they didn't disappoint. The wine was excellent as well as the dinner. I had the Miso Salmon and it was done perfectly. Our waiter was also extremely attentive, but not overly, which was also excellent. I will definitely be back again soon. ",5
 I was visiting Phoenix and looking for a great restaurant that could meet my needs from a health perspective as well as making my palate happy.  The wait staff helped me pick options and everything was truly delicious.  I will definitely eat there again on my next visit. ,5
" I didn't pick the restaurant, but was glad my asst did.  The food was very good and the service was just right, allowing for the business conversation that I was there to have, but not needing to search for someone. ",4
" I brought a group of 18 business owners in for a meeting.  We could not have been treated better by Shea the manager (hope I spelled her name right!), the serving staff and the chef's in the kitchen.  Food was excellent, service attentive and the 3 pies we ordered for dessert were presented perfectly and they tasted better than that.     It's hard to please 18 owners and you did it, we'll be back. ",5
" I was meeting some friends for dinner before a late night movie and it turned out wonderful. Quick and efficient service. Friday nights are typically crowded however making a reservation the day before shouldn't be an issue. I enjoyed the filet and it was amazing! There are many other items that the menu offers to meet the needs of different appetites. I would definitely recommend this place for a nice date, drinks with co-workers, or even a family dinner. ",5
" We love eating here...the food and drinks are guaranteed wonderful. We have always had good/great service, but our new server, Aaron, is FABULOUS! Having been a server in my past, I truly understand and appreciate great service. ",4
 Food was great. Each of us had a different entree and they were all amazing. Service was personable and proficient at the same time. ,5
" This is such an excellent place to have a casual or romantic date night out. Servers are quick, friendly and go out of their way to make your evening special. The food was delicious from start to finish and we had a cozy booth with little noise to disrupt our conversation. We would absolutely go back and recommend this to others. ",5
" Met up for a ""sisters lunch"" and we all four enjoyed the food,  the service, and the ambiance, and that is not something that happens often!  We all decided to make Grassroots a regular spot for our lunches. I am looking forward to my next visit to Grassroots. ",5
 We loved this place.  We were greeted courteously and seated immediately.  The menu is diverse and so the four of us were able to choose a dish that appealed to us.  The sashimi tuna salad was outstanding.  We ended our meal by sharing the most decadent  brownie. ,5
" Went here for a company team lunch. The food was wonderful. The dad's grocery bag appetizer was bigger than similar appetizers at other places and delicious. We had a wide variety of the menu and were all pleased, if not impressed, with our dishes. My dish, the portabella mushroom sandwich with a side of collard greens, was absolutely amazing. ",4
 I was pleasantly surprised how nice a visit with my old friend I was able to have in this environment and the food was fabulous!  They had a great selection of food choices and it was very hard to only pick one.  The wait staff were very attentative but not instrusive at all. ,5
" Fantastic chicken Waldorf salad. Tender moist chicken with nice greens and plenty of the fruits and nuts. The vegetarian plate was outstanding,  with a braised cabbage, a sautéed greens dish that was really delicious,  grilled asparagus and fresh tomatoes.  I would go again just for the grilled bread with honey. Just sorry we could not try more dishes. ",5
 What a great place food and service was outstanding And the beer was ice cold. ,5
" Grass Roots was recommended by a Nordstrom Rack employee a few years ago and it continues to be my favorite place. I have been for special occasions or just to have their killer pie and the food is always great, the service wonderful, and the atmosphere the best each and every time regardless of which location I visit. Always my first choice and Open Table made it easy to reserve a table. ",5
" Pleasantly surprised with the food, drinks and service at the renovated Town &amp; Country shopping center.  The ribs I had may be the best ribs in Phoenix now.  Service was very attentive but not interfering.  Definitely will go back. ",5
" We have always had a excellent experience at Grassroots.  Excellent food and selection, excellent service, and nice ambience. ",5
" When I visit a restaurant for the first time, I like to ""conquer"" the menu by sampling several courses and enjoying various beverages. I started off with the ahi poke with wontons, which was a delight. The burrata with arugula and toast points came next. The creamy cheese soaked up the arugula and dressing, making for a fabulous appetizer/salad. Next was the 6-ounce portion of miso salmon, which was perfectly cooked to medium and came with several fat stalks of asparagus. Finally, because it was close to my birthday, I received a complimentary order of butterscotch pie, which was the special dessert of the day. It was a smooth, sweet ending to a delectable meal.  I had a couple glasses of tap wine - a white blend and a Sauvignon Blanc, which were reasonably priced and tasty. Grass Roots has a variety of wines an beers on tap in addition to bottles.  I would be remiss if I didn't compliment the service staff. Sarah the bartender took care of me, which included patiently answering countless questions and offering excellent suggestions. My green iced tea and water never went below half-full, which was much appreciated. However, any one of the waitstaff was eager to offer help at any time. ",5
" Though the appetizers are fairly standard, the entrees offer some refreshing changes. They are one of the few restaurants that treat their veggie platter seriously. Veggie chop salad is outstanding and desserts are always good. We like the beer and wine list as well. ",4
" It was hotter than Hades outside so we couldn't enjoy the patio, but the restaurant was nice and cool inside. The food was excellent, the wait staff were attentive, friendly and helpful.  We would definitely go back and have already recommended it to a friend.  If you want to die and go to heaven, get the brownie with homemade ice cream and homemade caramel sauce.  But you better save room or split it with 4 people because it's huge! ",5
 We always enjoy the perfectly cooked veggies and really good specials (especially the scallops and grits) but have to save room for the pie!! ,4
 I am on a special diet and our server really paid attention to my needs and made sure my food was prepared correctly. It's hard enough eating out on a highly restrictive diet but I was very pleased with the attention they paid to my needs. ,4
" Great vibe.  Luis, our Server, was attentive , helpful and professional.  The food was delicious.  Large salads, very fresh and filling. Love Open Table and having my reservation ready when we arrive. ",5
" Chef/owner Chris Collins has created a great ""neighborhoody"" restaurant with a top notch menu.  Love, love, love this place and I eat here and bring friends often.  I've never been disappointed. ",5
" While it was too hot to sit outside this time, Grassroots has a nice patio for outdoor dining.  Food is always terrific and service outstanding. If you are a fan of Key Lime Pie, save room for it - Grassroots serves one of the best ever! ",5
 After hearing great things about Grassroots we finally had dinner here the other night. The food was great. Good atmosphere and wonderful service by Josh. Portions are large and they might have one of the best pours of wine in town. We will definitely be back. ,4
 Excellent food and very knowledgeable and helpful waiters. Great spot for early dinner if you are going to show or game in downtown Phoenix. Have had several lunches and now dinner and food is consistently great. ,5
 Fun spot - staff so friendly - great food - one of he best spots in the Valley!! ,5
" Slow service, and so so food. Seems like a place for an older crowd. Classy looking place, but left disappointed. ",2
" Price was fair. Food was good, as long you are happy with what ever the waitor brings, not what you order. Service could of been much better, I was giving wrong salad and my wife was giving wrong entree. When the waitor realized it he just said ""well are you ok with what you got""? No big deal for him.... Also there were only about eight tables occupied but we were put at only table right next kitchen door, with a plant on the ground that every time a waitor, waitress, bus boy walked in and out of the kitchen the were walking into the fake plant. ",2
" We were more than surprised at the experience. This was an early Valentine's Day celebration and included my wife and father in law. It was the best food we have had in several years of dining! The flavors were robust throughout! The service was exceptional! Five star food, five star service and two star prices.  I have already strongly recommended Alexi's Grill to all my friends and contacts. We are definitely scheduling another reservation very soon. ",5
 Very comfortable for single diners and business travelers. The venue is situated near several hotels and has small tables in quiet corners for guests dining alone. ,4
 Hit at rush for theatre crowd. They handled the crowd very well but next time I would book about 1 hour later. Food and service excellent. ,4
" Despite being jammed with the pre-show crowd, the staff &amp; kitchen took everything in stride. Our food came out on time, our server was friendly, and the whole experience was basically excellent. The grilled salmon was terrific. We'll be back soon. ",5
 Unbelievably great! It's been a long time since we've had such a great first-time experience at a restaurant. ,5
" Alexi's has been part of our dinner rotation for years. This visit featured the squid steak and the desert cannelloni. The former comes in two styles: capers/tomatoes/olives or with a lemon sauce; this time I went with the former and it was excellent. My date was likewise pleased with the cannelloni (veal &amp; spinach filling, jalapeno tomato sauce on top). If the veal chop is offered as a special (which it frequently is), it's a good bet. So is the duck with Grand Marnier sauce. Given its north-downtown location, we also like Alexi's for a nice getaway lunch when the office workload permits. ",5
 What an amazing experience. Gotta try the short ribs with jalapeño grits. Ribs were so tender...just fell apart with a fork and the grits...a little kick but not too bad. Throw in the barrel aged Manhattan and I was in heaven. ,5
 Nice variety on the menu and everyone enjoyed their meal. Service was great. Sat on the patio so it was nice. ,4
 Always enjoy eating here ,4
" Trey, our server was wonderful! Highly recommend this location and the great staff! Also Black Tea is amazing.   We were greeted multiple times by staff and the chef. I really appreciated that level of customer service.   Thank you, Grassroots! ",5
 Grassroots is always delicious! One of my favorites! ,5
" Grassroots is a wonderful place to share time with the special people in your life. The location, food, and beverages are excellent. I eat out a lot, and it's always very special when it's date-night at Grassroots. ",5
" Excellent service and food - menu is varied enough to please everyone, and so far everything we've tried has been very good. Great neighborhood spots - we've been to both the Phoenix and Scottsdale restaurants multiple times, and have never been disappointed. ",5
" We had a wonderful dinner on the patio. I was afraid it might be chilly but the patio has roll-down clear shades and overhead heaters which made it the perfect temperature. The food was delicious. I had the halibut special and it was fantastic. I would have to say the highlight was our server, Mary (from Michigan). She was knowledgeable, friendly and attentive. She gave us plenty of time to chat and didn't rush us through our meal. Overall, excellent service! ",5
 Great food! Service could have been better. I waited 20 min for a glass of wine on a Tuesday night and not busy. ,4
" Good food with interesting choices on the menu. Very accommodating with substitution. Poke was great as was  ahi tuna. Gumbo was good, not great. Short ribs were delicious.  Loved the asparagus and pork belly appetizers. ",4
" We've been to Grassroots plenty of times before and we've always found the food to be exceptional - highly recommend the shrimp and grits and tuna poke! Service was so-so this time around. I think we had about 3 different waiters during our entire visit, so we weren't sure who to flag down to get a refill on our drinks. Overall - good food at fair prices, although service could be a bit better. ",3
 Grassroots has become a staple of our “go to“ restaurants in the area… The salads and sandwiches are exceptionally good and last night we tried the baby back ribs for the first time and they were beyond heavenly! This restaurant is an excellent reliable staple that always offers fresh tasty fare in a relaxed enjoyable environment! ,5
" This was our first visit to Grassroots, celebrating our 27th wedding anniversary.  I can't say enough about the bar staff, wait staff, food and drink selection.  Everyone was so attentive!  Their specialty cocktails were delicious (we had the Sazerac &amp; Sangria - yum!) and the food was prepared with thoughtfulness and care.  Even thought it's somewhat out of the way for us, we WILL be back! ",5
" Anniversary dinner; wonderful, low-key restaurant located within a large strip mall.  Comfortable, casual dining atmosphere.  They specialize in 'farm-to-table' dishes and most if not all items are organic.  Service was excellent.  Varied unique menu.  My wife ordered the broiled rainbow trout and it was done to melt-in-your mouth perfection.  Side salads were substituted and were delicious.  I opted for the barbecue brisket.  It was so tender it almost melted in your mouth.  Topped with a nice sauce that didn't mask the wonderful flavor of the brisket.  The restaurant gave us a free dessert in honor of our special occaision and we ordered the very large brownie, topped with chocolated sauce, vanilla ice cream, caramel sauce and toffee crumbles.  We inhaled it as it was such a fitting end to a wonderful evening.  Thanks to our server Victoria for making it such a memorable occaision. ",5
 I like the Scottsdale location better.  Server was very attentive and helpful.  Menu is as other locations.  It's a good place to try something different. ,4
 I’ve don’t hear a few times and enjoy the atmosphere in the quality of food. On this particular evening ahead desire for the barbecue and enjoyed it immensely. ,5
 Awesome service and food! We threw a surprise bridal shower and the staff was more than flexible! ,5
 Loved our server great sense of humor and needed with our grump bunch ,5
" This was our first time at this establishment.  We had seen many good reviews on the restaurant and wanted to give it a try.  We were seated at a great booth.  We started with the Common Ground Burrata appetizer.  It was so very tasty.  The Jammin' Spicy Tomato jam was out of this world.   And you can buy a pint to take home.  Then we ordered the Short Ribs and the Brisket.  They both came with the amazingly yummy Jalapeño Cheese Grits.  Don't let the Jalapeño scare you, it was just the right amount of hot.  And I don't like hot.   The Shorts ribs just fell apart and were so juicy.  My date ordered the Brisket, but he liked my Short Ribs a little better.  We had a fabulous waitress, that surprised us with the Chocolate Toffee Brownie.  It was so delicious.  It was the perfect ending to a great evening at Grassroots.  We will be back. ",5
" Great food choices, excellent wait staff, nice place to meet friends coming from different directions within the metro area.  We will be back! ",4
 We have dined at Grassroots for years and but the service for our holiday staff lunch was offensive and non-attentive which we have never experienced before. ,2
" Always love Grassroots, we eat there a few times a month and take out of town guests there as well, they NEVER disappoint! ",5
 Food is always good &amp; service is always excellent. ,5
" Grassroots is one of the consistently great restaurants in the valley.  My friends and I have had a great experience there every single time.   We have enjoyed both locations in Scottsdale and Phoenix.  Our server, Eliza, was excellent.  Our food was prompt and amazing.  They have the best pork chop and pork belly in town.  In a sea of many great restaurant options, we keep coming back to Grassroots. ",5
 Wonderful! Good food! A perfect evening with the woman I love. ,5
" Great service, fantastic food and lovely atmosphere. ",5
 Excellent food and service. Nice menu with a good variety of dishes. ,5
 Good food great service!  Always nice people that work there! ,5
 Service was fantastic. Food always great. ,4
 So good! The shrimp and grits was over the top amazing! ,5
 Food is always wonderful as is the service. We keep going back! ,5
" My husband and I were visiting Phoenix for a brief vacation and looked for a unique establishment for brunch and found GRASSROOTS. We were glad we made reservations there. The food was wonderful, just what we looking for, not too heavy a meal. Our waitress was very friendly and sincere. Next time we're in Phoenix, we'll dine again at GRASSROOTS and maybe bring some friends. ",4
 Will probably return but vegetarian options are very slim. ,4
 Whenever we visit Phoenix we always enjoying dining out a Grassroots.  The food is great and the stsff is always friendly and recommending different goods to try ,5
 Trey our waiter was fantastic! He read our table immediately and had a lot of fun with us. ,5
 Food was very good &amp; wait staff was super helpful with selections. ,5
 The food here is incredible. Southern inspired comfort food will satisfy your taste buds from start to finish. A group of four of us came here one evening and every dish we ordered was fantastic! Will definitely be coming back. ,5
" This restaurant never disappoints.  The food is fresh and enjoys an  inspired preparation.  Desserts are very large.  A few standouts are the braised short rib chili, blackened red fish, apple brined pork chop, salmon, key lime pie and strawberry icebox pie. ",5
 The food was great.  Just everything else seemed a hassle.  Getting a booth after being seated at a tall table with two small children.  Getting refills on drinks.  Being rushed by the server.   Just could have been so much better with such little effort ,2
 Nice lunch with family. Salads were large &amp; tasty. Service was accommodating.  Very difficult to find if unfamiliar with the location ,3
 Highly recommend.  We are from out of town and went to Alexi's due to the great reviews.  We were not disappointed! ,5
 Great restaurant with great staff and food!  Place to be seen! ,5
 A class of its own. Super staff and management. Great ambience. Fresh seafood. A real treasure in the heart of mid-town. ,5
 Delicious trout and duck entrees.  Always a great place to take friends or company.  Staff is friendly and very helpful. ,5
" Delicious food, attentive &amp; friendly service...all in an atmosphere where you can hear each other speak! We will definitely go back! ",5
 It is always lovely when the owner stops at your table and welcomes you back. ,5
 Great menu with lots of variety; waiter good about making sure we made our play on time.  We will return for our upcoming plays. ,5
" As always the food, service and prices were.......Awesome!! ",5
" This was my 1st visittotheRestaurantinseveraltears,and, I was very pleased with every aspect of our Lunch. ",5
" Alexi's is always a pleasure.  The food is fresh and of high quality.  The staff is friendly, experienced, and efficient.  It is my favorite place for lunch downtown. ",5
 We dine at Alexi's frequently and have never had a negative experience.  Michael his team will take exceptionally good care of you from the moment you arrive until the moment you leave.  The food is quite simply fantastic!!!! ,5
" Superb team, fresh seafood, wonderful service. Michael and his crew never disappoint! ",5
 It is always a pleasure to dine at Alexi's. The food &amp; atmosphere &amp; service are excellent. ,5
" This was the umpteenth time we have been to Alexis. As always, we were more than satisfied. Last spring we took an out-of-town guest. Since then, Alexis has been her ""go to"" place whenever she is in town. ",5
" This is my third meal at Alexi's Grill and it was just as delicious as the first two.   The service was superb,  and the flavors of the food were amazing.    If I actually lived in Phoenix, I would go there more often, but instead, we use it for special occasions in the Phoenix area.   I highly recommenced it. ",5
 Food is consistently good.  Great place to dine and visit with friends prior to theatre-night! ,4
" Had wedding lunch there. Was told on phone we would have a ""room in the back"".I was expecting a separate space for the 12 of us but we were just in the restaurant  with others all around which made hearing challenging.. Could have had 2 servers because we had to ask a few times for things we ordered. Food was excellent however and price was very reasonable. Ambiance very nice.W ould return with smaller party. Would be romantic for two. Great parking for downtown Phoenix a nice surprise ",4
 Impeccable service and food! Great ambience along with the best wait staff in town! ,5
" We went to Alexi's for my birthday luncheon.  David, our waiter, was great.  The food, I had trout and my husband had salmon, was excellent.  They gave me a complimentary tiramisu for my birthday.  The decor is art deco - very nice.    The music was on low, which is really prefer - that or no music.  Overall, it was an outstanding, enjoyable experience. ",5
" My second visit and again, spectacular food!  I had a roasted pork chop, linguini, glazed carrots and broccoli. My friends had an assortment of all the dinner specials and none were disappointed.  Drinks, salads and breadsticks rounded out a terrific evening. ",5
" This was my second visit to Alexi's, once for lunch and once for dinner. Both times, I had salmon and both times, my meal was excellent and the service was perfect. I will return to try other dishes whenever possible. ",5
" Everything was excellent - SUPERB! The halibut luncheon special was flawless - garden salad was crisp and favorful, breadsticks warm and flavorful, excellent vegetable medley and saffron rice, and halibut and sauce cooked to perfection. Unlimited iced tea and water, and we saved room for desserts - key lime  pie at its best! ",5
 Alexi's Grill never disappoints. The service is excellent and carried out by professional servers. The support staff are prompt and courteous. The food is always excellent with generous portions and a good value. It's also easy to have a conversation without straining to hear. It's always a hit when we take guests. ,5
 Always a good meal.  Always good service.  One of those restaurants with staying power.  The staff does not turnover.  They are polite and professional. ,5
" My husband and I go to Alexis quite often, especially when we have a function in downtown Phoenix since we live in North Scottsdale....we go before we go to the theater or to a museum.  If we go to a sporting event, we usually eat dinner at that venue and then we don't go to Alexis.  This restaurant is always consistent and we like the service and the atmosphere. ",5
 A superb restaurant.  It surpassed my expectations!  Great service and ambience along with  terrific food! ,5
 Alexi's is always a fine place to meet &amp; talk with friends. Good food &amp; excellent service. ,5
" As always, the food was quite tasty and the service was excellent.  One of my favorites as it is so reliable. ",5
" The service was good for such a large party and the food was great. Only small issue with a food allergy that the waiter didn't know was in the desert, so make sure if you do have a food allergy make them ask the chef to verify. ",4
" Alexi's was comfortable and slightly more upscale than Olive Garden.  Food was average, but I would definitely go back because I think it was a good value.  If you work downtown, Alexi's would be a great place to lunch with coworkers. ",3
" Alexii's is a wonderful place to eat The staff is courteous, food delicious and Michael the owner greets and welcomes customers.  The atmosphere is  not loud but  you hear the low talking of happy patrons.  The menu is lengthy and comprehensive and has something for everyone.  Its a  great restaurant to go to if you are from Central Phoenix or anywhere in the Valley of the sun. I recommend it highly ",5
 We have been ding at Alexi's Grill  for many years.  It was FANTASTIC AS ALWAYS! ,5
 I ordered Caeser salad and so did my friend. We both rec'd house salads. I asked to sub pasta for potatoes. Got it with potatoes. Then they took the dish away and brought it back with pasta but NO vegetables. My friend said NO capers and her dish was covered with capers. I've been there in the past but would never go back! ,2
" We had happy hour in the bar and moved to the dining side for dinner. The food was amazing, the service was very personal and friendly. The owner came and checked on us more than once. We will definitely be making this place a regular destination. ",5
 Alexi's feels like a neighborhood spot in the middle of downtown.  Food is always great and the service is friendly and accommodating. ,4
 Food was delicious and reasonably priced.  The waiter was especially helpful in deciding what to eat.  Staff was very accommodating. ,5
" Our server ID was 15. He did a perfect job!  Felt like we were at the Ritz,  only better. Great luncheon experience! ",5
 Awesome place!  Love the service - especially David.  You can't go wrong eating here! ,5
 We have been customers for over 15 years.  The food and service is always terrific. ,5
 God food for all of us with good service. Our server was very helpful when we reported a lost  wallet and  he was able to locate it!   MANY THANKS TO HIM. ,5
 Great restaurant.  Easy access off of Central Avenue; seated right away and super food.  Always good and plenty of choices. ,5
" The Duck special has been a tradition with our business group for over 20 years.  Everyone comes for the duck, but often pick another entree which proves to be just as appetizing. We did have a disappointment for the first time.  The Halibut was overcooked, which ruined its flavor.  The waiter immediately apologized and switched the order at no charge.  It is always easy when everything goes right, but when trouble occurs the real character of the restaurant is in the handling of problem. Kudos to Alexi's!!! ",4
" Great service. Food was decent, halibut was a tad over cooked. Thought pricing was a bit high as well. ",3
" I was sadly disappointed.  The chicken tasted strange.  The waiter made me feel that I was bothering him whenever I needed something.  The salad was good.  I had to ask for grated cheese multiple times instead of having it at the table.  The bus boy was very good about keeping the ice tea's constantly filled up.  The bread on the table had no taste.  Very sad.  I went there for dinner many years ago and had enjoyed it, that is why I brought my girlfriends with me for a special get together lunch.  This was very disappointing. ",2
" Filet perfectly cooked, friendly server, enjoyed our meal very much.  Lived up to rating on 4square. ",4
 Had a very lovely date with my hubby here.  It's a little more pricey than we usually go for but the experience was worth it for us.  Would go again for a special occasion! ,5
 Loved the food and the staff was extremely pleasant and knowledgeable. ,5
" When you first walk in Hostess very attentive and welcoming waiter friendly explained the specials, from appetizer to main course he brought out the dishes when we completed each meal promptly other waiter very courteous and attentive we had the phoenix symphony to attend which the restaurant was close by overall excellent service and dinner ",4
 The drinks were excellent. I do not recommend the Pasta Alfredo with smoked salmon as it was way too salty. The steamed mussels were fabulous. The roasted eggplant had a bit too much oil so it felt greasy in my mouth. The side salad with the house dressing was delicious. The Tarisumi was also delicious. ,3
" Remarkable waiter. Classy, charming, with it. Food, magnif! ",5
" This restaurant did not live up to the hype that I have heard about.  Service was lacking to say the least.  Server was forgetful and would disappear for long periods of time.  Ordered some alcohol beverages and was not too impressed.  Food was good, but again was missing any ""WOW"" factor.  This restaurant is promoted as a high end, classy restaurant and charges as if they are.  But seems as if that is only based on the looks of the exterior of the building.   Other than that, I could have gotten the same type of service and quality of food at a Denny's. ",3
" Our first time there. It was a pleasant surprise, quite busy and it was very cozy. The food was delicious and we will certainly be back. I wish I remembered our servers name because he was really good too! ",5
" Great birthday dinner for husband. He had duck, I had sirloin pasta. Both were delicious. Prices are good for central Phoenix. Server was attentive, but not overly. Manager was very welcoming. Felt like a new ""favorite"" in the neighborhood. ",5
" What a surprise. Picked this restaraunt out of the blue while perusing a rating site. We made a reservation and were greeted by one of the owners and seated promptly. Our waiter was spot on and very attentive. The food choices are plentiful, but the real gems are on the special menu. I had the grand marne duck and my wife had the rack of lamb. They were both spectacular. It is quite quaint on the inside, and everyone appeared to be enjoying themselves and the food. We will definitely be back. ",5
" Sister restaurant to another favorite Chirto's. Both specialize in good service, splendid entreees  and reasonable prices. This was our first visit to theis venue and it sure won't be the last. ",4
 Shrimp scampi and Salmon were perfect. Busy night (theater night) but no lapse in excellent service as always. A real favorite of ours. ,5
" Excellent food, wonderful service, nice ambiance although a bit loud, great menu selections, very reasonably priced. ",5
 I have dined here on other occasions and each time has been a great experience. ,5
" Alexi's Grill is a wonderful restaurant, and enjoyed dining with my very significant other. Dinner was followed with our evening attending the Phoenix Symphony.   We will return for dinner again soon. I'll be the guy sitting across from the beautiful woman. ",5
" Good service, average food, nice wine list, expensive for average food ",3
 Veal chop was excellent ,4
" Our second visit on New Year's Eve found the intimate room filled, requiring a 15 minute wait after our reservation time, nonetheless, we two had a most enjoyable meal with attentive service all evening. It was difficult to hear my lady friend over the energetic conversations other other diners nearby. The food (we each had a meat entre) was superb and the portions were such that we each took some home to enjoy the next evening. The tab came to $93 plus tip. Alexi's is a 'must-try' for lunch or dinner any time one visiting the Central Avenue area near Indian School Road. ",5
 Great food and service! Highly recommend trying their special menu items offered ,5
 Alexis is a very good go to restaurant. The service is impeccable and the food is consistently good. Never a bad meal. ,5
 Best fresh fish; good pasta; reasonable prices; easy parking; great long-term staff. A go-to lunch place for many business people in central Phoenix ,5
" All of our entrees were excellent, the wait staff was attentive; a very nice evening was had by all. ",5
 Excellent meal at Alexi. Rack of lamb was cooked perfectly. Desserts were excellent. Service was  great. We have never had a bad meal at Alexi. Have recommended it to several friends. ,5
" Excellent choice for fine dining  before the theater.  Good menu options, good service. ",4
" Nice atmosphere, very good service, and a good value as the food was excellent. ",4
 Great place to have a business lunch.  Food is always prepared as ordered with fresh ingredience.  Open for dinner Friday/Saturday - great for date night. ,5
 Great food and great service and a awesome owner  Great parking ,5
 Loved the fresh mussels and calamari.  Great happy hour. ,5
" Wonderful atmosphere and delicious dinner. The birthday boy enjoyed his salmon alfredo dish so much, that he said he wanted to marry it. Will definitely be back again soon. ",5
 The service was excellent .  We were seated promptly and our drinks were served within a few minutes. We ordered and were served in a very reasonable time period. Food was superb. ,5
" Food was great and our server, Steve was attentive without hovering we will definitely be back ",5
 Firstvisit.  Hostessandbartenderverypersonable.  Had themussels.   Reallygood! ,5
" Have been going to this restaurant for 10 years or more for birthdays for work friends and post play at Orpheum.  It is consistently good, great seafood, great service, lovely outdoor dining.  I highly recommend this restaurant as a place for special occasions. They have a garden in front which they use in their food preparations. ",5
" The staff was very pleasant and helpful.  I felt the food came out way to fast. The dish I had chicken  bolognese. Which it was not what I expected as there was no meat in the sauce.  I felt it was over done with herbs. Also had fried calamari which was oily and much to much oregano.  My friend had a penne and beef which was not good the sauce tasted a bit like the sauce I had on my chicken but then had canned roasted peppers, just didn't work.   The decor was warm and welcoming and the pricing on the menu was surprisingly inexpensive ($12-$15) entrees. The specials were much more in the &amp;25-$30. Range. Im don't think I will  be back expecting much more. ",3
" I have been to Alexi's on several occasions.  I have never been disappointed in the food, the service or the atmosphere.  I would recommend Alexi's to anyone - either for special occasions or to become a regular.  Wine list is great as well! ",5
 Food and service were excellent and was able to have conversation without competing with music or other patrons. ,5
" I asked for a ribeye medium and they served it to me burned black chard on the outside and raw on the inside. Servers seemed to be stressed out, took a while to bring bread and butter and they actually asked if I need some which was strange. ",2
 Waitress was especially special. Very good and attentive. ,5
 Amazing as always ,5
 Awesome service &amp; food. ,5
 I was very disappointed in menu selection and thought it  was extremely over priced. I had the 12 ounce prime rib which was tough and about one forth fat.  Next time I will take my date to Charlestons.  Ron C ,3
 I love Firebirds. I’ve been there many times and I’ve never been disappointed. Portion sizes are just right- not huge. My favorite is the 7 oz filet with a Caesar salad. Service is always good. Make reservations though. ,5
" Although we were there only for dinner (delicious!), there was a hopping bar scene separate from the dining area which looked like fun. ",5
" Great dining experience!   Our server Nadeen was friendly and knowledgeable, making excellent suggestions and answering all questions. ",5
" Took over a hour and 15 minutes to get our steaks. We had small children with us and we expressed the concern to staff, they said they couldn’t do anything about it. Food came out finally, but steak was cold. Brought to attention of staff and they asked if we wanted to redo them. Declined due to worry about wait and left. ",2
" I have been to Firebirds multiple times for both lunch and dinner.  The food is always excellent and the wait staff friendly, helpful with wine and meal selections, and efficient.  I recommend it a lot to my friends/neighbors who are looking for a good restaurant. ",5
" The filet melted in my husband's mouth, I loved the prime rib, my friend loved the salmon and her husband raved about the surf and turf.  Not cheap but food was worth it! ",5
" This great restaurant really tries hard to please. Bartender made a special Mai Tai drink per our request which was delicious. Waitress was very pleasant and attentive. The place is dimly lit and perfect for a nice couples meal. Steaks are aged and very tender. My grilled lobster tail was a bit overcooked but still enjoyable. Kitchen sent out the wrong potatoes with our meals, but it was quickly corrected. Be sure to try the amazing creme brulee cheesecake. It is to die for! The restaurant manager greets each guest after their meal to inquire about the food and service.You can tell that he really cares about your dining experience.  Can't wait to return to the Phoenix area to dine here again! ",5
" Just not what my wife and I were expecting for the price. Food was good and the service was excellent, but the setting was more of a “sports bar” setting and was not cozy for the price we paid. ",2
" Our server was professional, knowledgeable of the menu as well as personable / friendly.  Our meals were outstanding / delicious.  Great atmosphere. ",5
" Very good meal. My ribeye was delicious! Great BLT salad. Our server, David, was spot on. ",4
 I was looking for a good steakhouse that didn’t have that  “chain” feeling yo it.  The Tibeye was worth the $27.99 that I paid for it I added the side salad and was surprised at how good it was.  The restaurant itself is on the boarder of looking a little dated.  The uniforms of the servers was all black with a 70s Stevie Nicks metal belt.  Not sure how that blended with the Firebird name.  Get reservations it made it easy getting in. ,5
" We are so impressed with Firebirds. We were seated immediately even though the lunch time was busy. The ambiance is great. Nikki was our waitress and she is wonderful. She made the experience perfect. We took a friend from India there and he debated about the salmon or trying beef which he never had the opportunity to try. She suggested he stick with what he loved and when she brought the food out, there was a small plate of a sample of beautifully grilled sirloin sample for him to try. He was thrilled and after trying it, was so glad he had salmon. The price is fair for the quality of food and great service. ",5
 Amazing food and very solid service. Definitely make a reservation as the wait would have been an hour and thirty minutes without one. ,5
 Amazing as always ,5
 Met friends for a nice lunch to catch up. I believe everyone enjoyed their food. ,5
" Firebirds is our go to place for special occasion meals like birthdays, anniversaries, and the like.  We have never had a bad meal at Firebirds and we will continue to spend our special days at Firebirds. ",5
" My favorite local place for a BLT salad, good prime rib and an excellent choice of side dishes.  My guest had an excellent petite filet..  There was confusion on the wine order and Firebirds resolved it.  One of my favorite local American food places.... ",5
 Service was good but food was not. Steak came out too salty and over cooked  had to send it back. Husbands side dish was cold and his steak was over cooked also. For the price would not go back again. I had to get my food to go because appetite was ruined. ,1
 Trout fish not cooked and aged ribeye steak not very satisfactory. ,4
" It was New Year’s Eve and my birthday. We sat outside  &amp; it was perfect. The server was delightful , smart, helpful, prompt, etc.  Really a perfect evening!! ",5
" It's our go to for birthday's, anniversaries, New Year's and Valentine's Day. ",5
 We were at the restaurant on New Years eve and We were very very impressed. Everything seemed to be running very smoothly. All of our food and drinks flowed with perfect timing and the food was delicious as usual. ,5
 We celebrated New Year's Eve here. It was a little loud...which was expected. But the food and service was fantastic! ,5
 The food is always good. Preparation spot on.  The food this time took longer the normal.  Service is normally very good   Today Service is only slightly above average. ,4
" I brought my husband here for his birthday, this was our 1st time visiting the restaurant. Didn't start off good, after being seated waiter came over and took our beverage order. After 15 minutes we had to flag down another waiter just to get water. She was very helpful she even asked if we would like an appetizer. Shortly after the waiter finally showed up (no apology  for the wait). He took our food order and began to walk off when I said ""can we have bread"" he said ""oh yeah"" as if he forgot. Waited 45 minutes for food to come out. I ordered chicken and baked potato and husband ordered a medium cooked steak with green beans. The waiter said his steak is why we had to wait so long. Now that would make sense if he ordered a well done steak. The food finally comes and is pretty decent except for my potato that I specifically asked for no bacon which was covered in bacon! After dinner the waiter brings the check. I had expressed to him  upon arriving it was my husband's birthday apparently he forgot. I asked do they provide complimentary desserts for birthdays as most restaurants do and he said ""yeah, sure"". If I hadn't said anything neither would he. I looked at the check and was charged the wrong price for the glass of wine I had so we had to wait while that got resolved. Overall I wouldn't say a horrible experience but not the best especially for a special night. ",4
 First time eating here. Food was excellent. Will return soon! ,5
" Food was awesome and plentiful!!  Service was excellent!  A little noisy, but that’s the price of success! Next time wifey and I will split a meal,cause like ai said,it’s a lot of food! ",5
 Some of the best food I have ever tasted ,5
 Always great service and the prime rib is best in the valley. ,5
 This was our first time to Firebirds and a friend recommended firebirds. We had a reservation and were seated right away. We ordered coffee drinks that were good. We ordered different steaks that were really good and the sides were also tasty. The ambiance is really nice and as we left I noticed the outdoor seating in front of a large fireplace. Next time I will be trying out the outside seating area. We received a really cool surprise after our meal since we were celebrating our anniversary : see below ,4
 Great food and service together with pleasant athmosphere. ,5
" This was my first time here. My wife and I were very impressed with meal selections, and service. We will most definitely be back. This has to be one of the best options in Chandler! ",5
 We really enjoyed our visit. This was our first visit and will definitely be back. ,5
 We are regulars at this place. It never disappoints. Nice atmosphere and food. ,5
" Our Board held a luncheon to honor volunteers at a small charity, and they were quick, efficient, and provided a high quality meal at a great price!  Linen tablecloths and napkins help provide upscale ambiance.  Not the new, upscale $14 hamburger places, but soup or salad, entree with vegetables and bread for $10 to $14 at lunch!  Several fresh fish choices, nice Italian dishes, well done presentation, and very good service for our group of 16. ",5
" Surprised they would run out of our wine, Malbec.  Surprising! ",5
 We enjoyed our dinner here very much.  We felt our waiter wasn't too attentive. ,4
" Michael  and Tina do an outstanding job of making you feel welcome, from the time you walk in until they say goodbye. The food is excellent and the prices very reasonable. The staff is mature and always provide excellent service. They have a good wine list and also very reasonable prices.  They also do an excellent job with large parties. We had a party of 82 and they did not miss a beat. The same excellent service and quality of food as you would get if you were only a party of 2 ",5
" Alexi's is a go to lunch place for us. They have an excellent menu and superb service.  As a regular, my mother is recognized and acknowledged every time we go in.  It is a good value for the money and just a nice place to sit for lunch. ",4
 I have eaten here a dozen times and always have a great meal. Lunch selection and cost with ambiance is superb. A nice fine dining experience and definitely recommend. ,5
 It was our anniversary and it was the perfect romantic spot with amazing foods! ,5
 Food &amp; service were very good-steaks cooked just as we ordered. ,4
" Great food!  Intuitive and awesome server!  Fairly expensive, but worth it once a year. ",5
" If you want some excellent food with consistently good quality with a classy atmosphere, this is your place.  Prices are on the high side, expect to shell out $50 per person for a drink and basic entree.  Although pricey, I felt that the combination of the food and experience was worth the price. I  will return. Especially good place for a special occasion. ",5
" Absolutely one of the best prime ribs ever!  Had a wonderful experience with a nice, stiff martini, professional staff and really good food.  Would definitely go back. ",5
" Received a warm welcome by the receptionist who remembered we were celebrating an anniversary.  The same was experienced as we were greeted by our waitress and her assistants.  Excellent menu choices one would expect from a steak restaurant, but was surprised at many choices on the menu beyond steak.  The restaurant was clean and inviting.  The table was set as one would expect for one that is highly rated.  Service from the waitress and her assistants was attentive but not intrusive.  Both my meal and my wife's was prepared to our expectations and even beyond.  The complementary desert for the anniversary we were celebrating was unexpected, but it topped off an excellent meal.  As we were warmly greeted by the hostess, we were as warmly greeted as we passed by her station as we were exiting the restaurant.  A delightful restaurant.  We will be back. ",5
 Excellent place for dinner or lunch. Food was outstanding!  - favorite. ,5
 Historic restaurant in Phoenix.  The food is good and the service exceptional at lunch. ,3
 Wonderful restaurant to go to before the Celebrity theater. Excellent food at a reasonable price. ,5
" Scott was our waiter. Unobtrusive and yet always there when we wanted something- a second before we wanted it.  Pecan pie was to die for- best ever. Filet and prime rib excellent. Oh my on stacked potatoes and baked potatoes. Didn't finish my baked potato. Took it home. I've never taken a baked potato leftover home. Oh my oh my. Thanks, Scott and Stockyards. ",5
" Always enjoy taking out of town guests to Stockyards. Service attentive, steaks excellent  and a nice wine list. ",5
 great special food.  The prime rib melted like butter.  Outstanding service and wonderful decor ,5
" We were at the Stockyards to celebrate my husband's birthday. We've been to the restaurant before and it was his choice for the celebration. We had Ron as our waiter (at least, I think that was his name: a little older, certainly experienced as a server). He was wonderful: professional, funny, observant, and unobtrusive. Our daughter had brought a pie for my husband to take home and Ron brought a bag for us for easy carrying. The food was outstanding: we each had the steak oscar- perfectly cooked and delicious.  Highly recommend the Stockyards. We will be visiting again soon when visitors are joining us in November. ",4
" Excellent dinner. Nice historical resturant. Cost is more, but we'll worth it... ",5
 Extremely disappointed .  The beef was subpar to any other steak restaurant that we have ever been to. ,1
 It was all great until the waiter came out chasing us asking about the bill. The bill was paid for before leaving the restaurant. It was a bit embarrassing having everyone see the waiter run to my car. ,2
" Our service was fast, efficient and very ""perky"".  Very nice.  Food was way above average.  We would definitely go again.  Great place to go pre- concert at the Celebrity Theatre. ",5
 Overall very good.  The restaurant would have received a higher rating but one of the diners received cold sweet mashed potatoes. ,4
 The food was AMAZING and the service was great.  Loved the history and the story behind the location.  Will definitely visit again! ,5
" My wife and I dined at the Stockyards prior to attending a Concert, and were very pleased with the experience.  The service was friendly and efficient, the food was served hot and perfectly prepared and the experience was very enjoyable.  We are eagerly anticipating the next chance we get to partake of the experience again. ",4
 Excellent food and service. Best steak I ever had. ,5
 Great dinner before a disappointing concert at the Celebrity.  Stockyard was the highlight. ,4
" My husband and I had dinner here right before a concert and really loved the quick service, ambiance and tasty food! Will make it a habit! ",5
 The Decor was inviting and comfortable ,5
 It is was a fine meal. Nothing in my opinion jumped out as outstanding. ,3
" Excellent, old established steak house. Great steaks and a wonderful wine list. Particularly appreciated that they have a small (5 oz.) filet. I love steak but do not like the current trend to enormous steaks.  Definitley a ""go to"" place with great atmosphere and service. ",5
 This is a community treasure! You are always welcomed with open arms.  Michael and his team are great members of the community.  Excellent service and food! Best of Phoenix! ,5
" Great food, great service, very convenient to downtown . ",5
" Business dinner was OK, but not really that special. Good atmosphere for business meeting. I was there for several hours and there were few people in the restaurant so the noisse level was very acceptable. ",3
" My first time here. We were impressed by the warm friendly staff and excellent food and cocktails at affordable prices.  The baked salmon and filet mignon were wonderful  entrees.  Tom was a very attentive server, and the owner and manager stopped by to check on our satisfaction with our overall experience.  I will go back some evening because of the pleasant overall experience. ",5
 As always we had a great time. Waiter Thomas always makes us welcome and the food for the price is a bargain. ,5
 Always great food and service.  Waiter very knowledge. Nice atmosphere ,5
 This is Restaurant week we enjoyed our dinner ,5
 Rick was awesome food was excellent except lobster ravioli was way to salty a bit disappointing but my daughters entree was great so we shared that ,5
 Excellent food and excellent service. It was my first time and I'll definitely be back again. ,5
 Amazing! Food and service was fantastic. ,5
" Alexis is one of our favorite restaurants and we often go there before attending a performance at the Phoenix Theater.  We have never had a bad experience. The food is incredible - at a reasonable price. The waiters are friendly.  No matter how hard I try, I cannot think of a single thing I would change. ",5
 The food was terrific. The staff were great. Thanks for helping us make this a very special occasion. ,5
 Had reservation and was seated on time.  Service was excellent.   Salmon was perfectly cooked.  Hubby has steak said it was really good. ,5
 Fantastic food and atmosphere.  The salmon was outstanding and the special veal cutlet was amazing. ,5
" We had a lovely lunch, good food at an excellent price. Our server was engaging and they had a free dessert for our birthday  girl. We will definitely go back. If you prefer a quieter atmosphere,  arrive after the business lunchers, 1:00 or so. ",5
 The poached salmon was the best I have ever eaten.  The other meals were fabulous too. I would highly recommend Alexi's to everyone.They also brought my daughter a special dessert since she had graduated that day from the University of Phoenix. ,5
" It's our favorite go to resterants for celebrating SPECIAL EVENTS, Birthday, Anniversary, and a place to take out of town guests to eat. Plus we LOVE TOMMY, AND HOW FRIENDLY THE REST OF THE STAFF IS, EVERY TIME!! ",5
 Service staff very attentive. Food was great ,5
 This is one of my favorite restaurants.  Excellent each and everytime. Love that it is family and locally owned.  Terrifice. ,5
" Good food, service was a little slow this time.  Staff is friendly, prices are reasonable. ",4
" I have been having lunch at Alexis' regularly since moving to Phoenix 25-years ago. I love these people, their food and the ambiance. It's a great place to see elected officials and corporate leaders. ",5
 Loved this place! Food and atmosphere was wonderful. We plan on visiting again. ,5
 It was a beautiful evening so we ate outside. Service was very good and very fast. Food was very good and seasoned just right. Nice portions as well. ,4
" Excellent service, great food , good setting and very reasonable prices. ",4
" We had a late lunch before going to the theater at Phoenix Theater.  It is a perfect place for pre-evening events.  The service (Steve)  was wonderful and the trout, my favorite, was perfectly prepared.   I had reviewed the menu previously and the limoncello/ mascarpone cake was a light cloud of deliciousness!  Thanks for making this a great start to a wonderful evening!  By the way, Nellie, who will greet you as you enter, was as perfect as you can get!!!! ",4
" It was my first time, we needed a restaurant before the theater.   It was very steril in decor. It did have tablecloths, service was excellent.  Most prices were reasonable.  The food was good, but I only tried one item, Halibut, $30-----little pricy-----OK portion 4-6 oz.........I would go back to try other items. ",4
" Great food, great staff and friendly atmosphere.  Michael and staff are the best.  I recommend Alexi's highly ",5
" The steaks are the best in town! the service excellent, relaxing, the vegetables done right. I discovered this restaurant a year a go and now a regular for lunch and now expanding that to dinner. ",5
" One of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix. Great atmosphere, good food and reasonable prices. ",5
 I have discovered this restaurant last year and have been often for their excellent filet mignon. The 'open table' reservation is totally a great feature as well. I have NEVER been disappointed. ,5
 Appetizer meatballs were great.  Other food just ok.  Felt overpriced for Olive Garden type food. ,3
 We were celebrating a birthday of a person who works in that building.  We had one hour. We were finished in 55 minutes and the birthday girl was presented with a beautifully presented piece of cheesecake with a candle.  Everyone loved their food and left very happy. ,5
 As always we are never disappointed with the meal and service at this restaurant. This was the first time for my friends to eat there and it was on my recommendation that we did.  The meal each had was truly delicious.  Will be returning again when going to the symphony or theater downtown. ,5
" Like all restaurants close to downtown, be careful on Fridays and Saturdays because of the symphony or theater.  The service tends to be slow and the food a bit on the poor side. ",3
" Always enjoy Alexi's for dining...be it just friends, or special occasions... staff has always been fantastic.. ",4
" Food was good but WAY over-priced. Had a $15 appetizer salad...it had 3 shrimp, a few pears and a few other things. Literally like 5 bites.Wow, $3 a bite.  One entree ordered was the BBQ pork belly. Very tasty, but over, way over-priced. $26 for 3 small pieces of prok. ",3
" Outstanding meal. Every course was delicious. Plenty of interesting, unique choices. Service was great. ",5
" Sad that this restaurant went through what appeared to be a forced ""concept change."" Completely taken off guard by the cheapened feel and fixed menu. Please return Top of the Rock to its fine-dining days. ",2
 Locally-grown food prepared in an artistic and authentic manner provided a special evening for my friends and family...we will definitely dine here for special occassions in the future. ,4
" Great food, AWESOME service... what more can I say! I love the place!! :-) ",5
" The service and food were incredible. It was a great first time experience at Top of the Rock for my fiance and I. It was romantic and had an incredible view of the city at night. The food was interesting and a little intimidating at first but once we made the decision to try something new, we did not regret it. The salmon was especially delicious. ",4
" Great view, good food, awkward service. One of our appetizers didn't come out until our entrees were out, so typically I would have expected not to be charged for this seeing as how we really didn't eat it due to the timing. But, the server may have been a little flustered or new or something. Top of the Rock probably won't make it into our regular rotation, but we'll definitely be back sometime. ",4
" Food was excellent and the chef bent over backwards to please us.  Too noisy to converse with seven at the table and the loud, but enjoyable, music. ",5
" Top of the Rock has long been a favorite place to treat my honey to a special night out. The view of central and downtown Phoenix at night is incredible. The restaurant itself is open and airy, but the architecture and decor make it feel intimate and comfortable. The locally-sourced ingredients are well and interestingly prepared. Our favorite dish was my honey's Baja Scallops, which were plump and perfectly seared and served with an inventive relish of grilled watermelon, radish, kumquat, jalapeno and sunflower seeds. My choice was a featured ""Restaurant Week"" three-course meal of peach and pear gazpacho, a tender beef filet, and a wonderful peach cobbler. We each ordered a 3-glass wine flight and were not dissapointed with any of them. ",4
" Amazing view! We were there during AZ Restaurant week, and both had the special menu. All three courses were fantastic, and we both had a specialty drink...WOW! Would totally go back! ",5
 Top of the Rock was amazing. The view coupled with the expertly cooked food truly made our night special. ,5
" The patio view is fantastic, and the service is very good. The food is very good. The only dissapointment is the value. Food is overpriced, and the portions are quite small. The wine is very over-priced as well, and they really push the 'full bottles'. The night was also a bit spoiled by people yammering away on their cell phones at their tables. (inside voices if you have to ignore your date to talk to someone more special). ",3
 Very good service and food is much better than I remember form 5 years ago. ,5
" The location, the Dinner and the Service were outstanding. Great evening, Thank you. ",5
" Food was really good. I have only been in the area for three months and this was the best food I have had here. There was some live music when I went, which I enjoyed so take note if you go. The lightning storm the night I went added to the view, but the restaurant really is great for food, service, and feel. ",5
" I really enjoyed the meal last night. Most notable were the giant scallops with kumquats and pork belly. Dessert came with the freshest cinnamon and vanilla icecream that I ever had. The restaurant really is built around the top of a small rocky mountain peak. It had a great view and was both airy and spacious. Service was excellent, professional and all smiles. Will definitely return. ",4
" Went here tonight for my husband's birthday. We're new to town and so I relied almost entirely on reviews to figure out where to take him for this special occasion.  We were not disappointed with our choice to have dinner here. We arrived shortly before sunset and were seated right by the windows. Our server had great recommendations and we loved the heirloom tomatoes and taco appetizers. For main courses, we ordered the pork belly and the fried chicken. Yum! We were surprised afterwards with a complimentary mousse dessert for the birthday. Very pleased with views, food, and service. No complaints here.  All throughout dinner, they had live entertainment. Awesome! We will be back and look forward to trying the fall menu. ",5
 They had live music playing. It was nice and lively and the place was packed. The view was outstanding. We went with a group of friends and everyone was blown away. Chef came out and brought us a small thank you. We will be back. ,5
" I have lived in arizona for over 20 years and for my 1st anniversary I decided to go to a restaraunt I heard so many great things about. I was sadly dissapointed. First off we were told to park at the bottom of the hill and enter through the doors of the conference center which were LOCKED! So we walked up the hill, I also had requested a window seat and was seated in a booth in the middle of the restaraunt. My husband ordered the Pot belly BBQ and there were three tenderloins on the plate one of which was mostly fat and unedible. The price for a bottle of sutter home i could have purchased for $ 5.00 at a wine store cost $30 and for the price of the tab the night was again sadly dissapointing. I will not be returning to the restaraunt. ",1
" Our first visit at the Top of the Rock was at 6:30 on Friday night right after we checked in to the Hotel. We decided to have a light dinner appetizers and dessert with drinks. The waitress was nice however, It took such a long time (35 minutes) to get, bread was supposed to be served with but it came after we completed our dishes. When we ordered dessert I ordered the bread pudding with ice cream, my wife ordered the peach cobbler that was mostly sauce with two peaches and no crust. We observed the table next to us &amp; realized that the gentleman sitting there had bread pudding twice the size of mine. So I kindly asked, if he order a double order? He replied no, it's not that good! He was so right the desserts &amp; tacos were terrible! Sad!! ",2
" The service was excellent. When we arrived, we were greeted at the door by the staff and taken to our table. We had a great view of the city and the ambiance was warm and friendly. Since it was our first time there, the chef introduced himself and brought a sample of one of his menu items for us to try. Dinner was excellent, the food and wine were choice. All in all, it was a great experience for my wife and I. ",4
" This is a great dining experience with great view of the Phoenix area. However, dining can a little loud with the bar area so close. This is no longer an intimate dining experience. ",4
 Beautiful presentation of tasty food. Good wine list. Strange that such a good restaurant has such terrible loud music playing. Really off-putting. And why are the two TV screens devoted to the Food Channel on a Sunday evening. ,4
 The menu was get difficult to understand and didn't have many options. For the price it wasn't worth the experience. ,2
" We really enjoyed our dining experience at Top of the Rock. Since this was our first visit the Chef visited our table and explained several of the local ingredients that he uses within his menu. Additionally, the service was excellent. Definitely, recommend this restaurant to everyone. We are looking forward to our next visit. ",5
" I went to Top of the Rock with my boyfriend for a kid-free night out. It was amazing from the moment we got there. We loved their menu with the focus on fresh foods that were locally grown and produced! The calamari appetizer was delicious and both of our entrees were phenomenal! We had the chicken and the salmon, both were absolutely amazing. The staff was helpful with suggestions and very courteous. It was a pleasure to eat here.  Also, this place, although gorgeous and a great place for date night, it very kid-friendly! There were a few tables with children nearby, yet it was still very upscale. ",5
" Chose the Stockyard for its fine reputation.  Unfortunately, four out of five said that either our steak or prime ribs was tough and chewy.  Very disappointed and would not recommend to friends especially considering the price. ",3
" Food was awesome and the waiter, John, was a riot! He has such character!  He and the great food made the evening very enjoyable. ",4
 Not one of our better meals. Steaks were very tough and no flavor at all. Hopefully it will be better next time. Service was good but then it always is. ,3
 The meat was just excellent. A must when in Phoenix. ,4
 the food was extremely good never had bad meal at this restaurant  will go again ,5
 The food was very good and hot. The waiter was excellent..... Harry is the best... The owner is very nice and appreciated him coming to the table to find out if all was right with the food. ,5
" It was the end of  restaurant week, which I didn't realize, so there was a much larger crowd than normal. That affected the noise level. It is still a favorite when I am in town. ",5
" We always pick Stockyard Restaurant for Restaurant Week.  We pick two others, but the third (last only because it's a given) is always the Stockyard Restaurant.  We love the food, the service, and the setting.  It's charming to sit in a very old, established, and loved restaurant.  We love the history of the Stockyard. ",5
 We enjoyed our visit and will return.  Restaurant week was a great value. ,5
" The restaurant was easy to miss from Washington Street due to all the new business buildings that have sprung up.   The nice lighting, high ceilings and comfortable seating was very much appreciated.  I took a friend there to celebrate his birthday.  It was  my first time eating there and I enjoyed the entire meal.  I ordered 8oz. filet mignon, mashed potatoes and an extra side of creamed spinach.  I also had a cup of New England Clam Chowder.  It was all soooo good!   My friend enjoyed his  meal just as well.  We both had a piece of warm pecan pie for dessert.  Our server was very respectful and made sure we had what we needed.   I would return and enjoy another meal at Stockyards. ",5
" This was our first time after living here 30 years.   The service could not have been better.  The decor was little changed since the restaurant opened and it was a nice departure from the ""slick"" new style of so many.  It kept the culture and style of the historic place.   Prime rib superb and the baked potatoes were very creamy.  The real star: Home Made Pecan Pie.  The best I have ever had...anywhere.  Great taste, silky and not gooey like most. ",5
 Wonderful food and great service. We order the Prime Rib and it was perfect! ,5
" Excellent and historic restaurant.  Loved that raw veggies and bread  was brought to the table right away.   Our steaks were wonderful and done just right. Our desserts were good too,  a cheesecake and strawberry shortcake.  This is a perfect place to bring out of town guests who like good restaurants that aren't too fancy and give a sense of Phoenix's past.  The 1889 bar is worth a stop - the carved bar is magnificent ",5
 I found this establishment very over priced for the quality and quantity of food. Service was excellent ,3
" Fabulous sensational food, atmosphere is first class and the value unbelievable with conscientious waiters serving as you prefer to be served. ",5
" Great Views, Good Food, Excellent Service.. Greeted warmly by the hostesses, cocktail waitress was friendly and efficient, our server was was very attentive, outgoing, great sense of humor and efficient without hovering... I would have no problem returning, as a matter of fact I may do so tonight... ",4
" The food was good, but the restaurant was a bit crowded. It was very noisy and sort of lost that romantic feel. The service was okay. I remember going about three years ago and the service was over the top. It seemed like too much money and not enough service or ambiance to make it worth the money. ",3
 Great views of the surrounding area. good food and service ,4
" Our server was fantastic! She asked if it was a special occasion and I jokingly said, ""First date."" My husband gave me an annoyed look, but she played along the rest of the night, including a free dessert, to celebrate. :) ",5
" We had our first visit to Top of the Rock this (7/31/2011) evening, and the experience was wonderful. At first glance, it may seem like an average to above average restaurant with the very casually-dressed clientele. But this is certainly not the case. The food and service were top notch! The food was familiar enough to not scare anyone off while still having that artistic flair that discerning guests want. We enjoyed an appetizer of heirloom tomatoes with havarti cheese and black truffle shavings all on a bed of spicy miso purée. Entrées were a cassoulet of game sausages and a salmon filet with grapefruit and red quinoa (a popcornish-like seed). We finished with 3 of their 4 desserts! I know..gluttons we are! It was a wonderful meal! ",5
" I expected it to be pricey. It was. But the entrees were good (salmnon and scallops), and actually weren't priced that exhorbitantly. However, the wait staff/hostesses seemed very mechanical and uncomfortable. Perhaps they felt a little guilty knowing that the place was a bit of a rip off. The incorrectly-named shrimp cocktail would've been acceptable at 14 bucks, had it actually been a few full shrimp tails draped over a steel cup of sauce. But when a salsa-type product arrived with chips (again, for 14 bucks!), that set a bad precedent.for the following meal. There were a few SMALL (I mean the size of my pinky fingerNAIL) pieces of shrimp in this 'salsa'. If the taste had been amazing, the lack of shrimp might've been ok. It wasn't. ",2
" great , except they ran out of my favorite dessert -white chocolate bread pudding!! ",4
" It, everything, was very okay.  Nothing was great, nothing was terrible.  We probably won't go again. ",3
 We had a good time and met friends. Good is always great ,5
" This was our first visit, the service was excellent and so were our meals. ",5
 We had a great wed at Alexis as we always do ,5
 Nice small restaurant with white table clothes and fresh flowers on the table... a nice change from all the new industrial looking restaurants in the area . The food is nicely prepared and the portions are generous. The staff was very friendly and helpful especially since it was a very busy evening for them. ,4
" Excellent service, food, and service.  Went before Phx Little Threatre play. ",5
" Excellent food, atmosphere and service at a great price.   Thomas was an excellent waiter and we all enjoyed the atmosphere.   Plus, it was very convenient to the Phoenix Theatre where we were going to a play.     Highly recommend it ! ",5
 We enjoyed our food at the Top of the Rocks Restaurant but the portion size is very small and the prices were very expensive. We expected the high prices but I was surprised at how small the portions were. ,3
" This restaurant is fantastic! I took my wife for her 30th birthday and it was perfect! We started with the heirloom tomato appetizer which was awesome. The old lady had the special of the evening which was a seafood rissotto and I had the filet. Everything was delicious and we couldn't stop there so we ordered dessert:-) my wife ordered the milk chocolate mousse with sea salt, and I had the peanut butter cheesecake, and let me just tell you it was phenomenal! Our server Rachel was great, the whole experience was everything I was looking for for this special occasion! It was worth every last penny! ",5
" Took someone here on a first date, the views where awesome, so where the staff and the food! Its about $50 per person with wine and tip. but well worth it! ",5
 Scallops great chicken done to perfection steak fun presentation House salad disappointment soggy veggies overdone in the vegetarian Entre This chef knows his meats wonderful flavors! ,5
" We stayed at the Marriott Buttes and wanted to try this restaurant. The view and decor of the restaurant was breathtaking! View was great, however our server was spread too thin with too many tables to serve in different parts of the restaurant. Service should have been better, we noticed the waiter across from us was turning over tables much faster and he wasn't running all over the restaurant. However, I would definitely recommend this restaurant. Not complaining about our server but manager should take more care in assigning tables to wait staff. ",4
 One of my Best dining experiences since being in the valley! ,5
" We had dinner outdoors on a beautiful night and watched the city and landscape as the sun set. The restaurant works with local providers as well as getting food from elsewhere ( fish. seafood etc) The menu was not huge but hand plenty of choices , so many it was hard to decide. I had salmon with two slices of grapefruit and a few olives served on Quinoa. It sounds strange but it tasted great. My husband had a steak served with sauted chard with vegatables and a tasty light sauce. Our server was attentive without being intrusive. We told her we were in no hurry and it did take a while for the food to arrive but that gave us more time to relax. The outdoor seating is surrounded by some cactus landscaping with a view of the city and airport ",4
" Excellent in every way.  The food (including the salad, which I generally don't get excited about) was wonderful, and the service superb.  What a lovely place. ",5
" Love this place. Has a real neighborhood feel -- a lot of ""regulars"", apparently.  It's not urban-modern-industrial chic like so many places downtown. More old school ambience. We ate outside by the water feature.  (Finally! It's been a long summer!) You can watch the light rail trains go by. Mostly Italian fare. The salmon Genovese is fabulous. ",5
 A great centrally located bistro with a consistently high level of service and just excellent food. Michael and staff do a wonderful job. My extended family is proud to call him a friend. ,5
 Our server did a great job of handling a large group for lunch for one of our co-worker's retirement party and getting us in and out quickly. ,5
 Beautiful patio!! Love the decor inside! The owner is so friendly and hands on! Amazing service and seriously the BEST halibut I have ever tasted!!!! ,5
" Good food, good service, good pre Phoenix Theatre spot! ",5
" Great Fish and Shrimp dishes, a salad to die for included, excellent service , lovely atmosphere and free parking ! This was our first visit and we will be back very soon.  If you are going to any show downtown, dine here first . You will be glad you did. ",5
" Excellent food, a variety of choices, and perfect service...efficient without being rushed! ",5
" Alexi's more than satisfied everyone at the table. We celebrated my bday with selections from the restaurant week menu. All 4 of us ordered different menu items and each of us were pleased with our selections. It was a great value and we enjoyed the experience. A must order are the calamari, chicken parm, shrimp &amp; pasta and any of the fine deserts (we had 3!). Thanks Alexi's we will be back soon. ",4
" We went for restaurant week and will definitely back. The portions were huge, house wine was delicious, the food was well prepared, and the service was amazing. ",5
 We had a nice happy hour with food and wind ,5
" The food was good, especially the Salmon.  Just not GREAT.  The salad and bread was actually a bit disappointing.  The wine was good and at a good price!  The whole place seemed to have a bit of an outdated look/feel.  At least on the night I was there it seemed to be mostly all senior citizens dining, which is okay!  It's just something I noticed. ",4
" Everything was delicious, except the cheesecake tasted like the kind you can get presliced at the grocery store. Not very good. ",4
 My meal was pretty terrible.  The salad was wilted and the cannelloni was just awful...terribly salty and very bitter tasting.  They had ground up peppers in it?!!  Yuck. ,1
" Alexis is always charming and elegant. The food and selection are great; the service consistently cordial. The wine pours could be a bit more generous, but that is absolutely the only negative thing I can think of to say. ",5
" Great place to meet for lunch because parking is easy, the food is good, and it is a great value! ",5
 Food was great as it always is. We had two glasses of wine and three apps. ,5
" The shrimp scampi and chicken parmigiana were wonderful, will order them again.  Our server, Ruben, was knowledgeable and friendly, hope to see him again.  The limoncello cake is a must try, yumo.  We are looking forward to  returning to Alexis's. ",4
" Alexi's ha been a popular meeting spot for Phoenix businesspeople as long as I remember. But I had not been there in several years. I needed a quiet spot for a business lunch(sometimes hard to come by in Phoenix). I was happy to say that the quality of food, service and ambience is still great. ",5
" I love going to Alexi's. It is a wonderful place in central phoenix where it is convenient to park and have a business lunch or a lovely dinner. The service is always great and the food terrific. Plus it is owned by Greeks, so who wouldn't love it! ",5
 We love Alexis for dining and a Great Happy hour menu ,5
" Food was great as usual, but our waiter was  rude. He would come to the table talking and interrupt our conversation without consideration. If it happens again, I will find another ""go-to""'restaurant where the servers are more considerate of their clients. ",4
 We  always enjoy our time at Alexis. Food is good met friends there ,5
" An excellent restaurant for Italian cuisine.  I've had lunch or dinner there on approximately ten occasions and have always had a consistent, pleasurable dining experience.  Excellent food, great service and friendly staff.  An excellent value for the money.  I highly recommend this restaurant. ",5
" Our server, Ruben, was friendly, helpful and attentive.  The lobster ravioli was tender and packed with lobster.  The halibut was perfectly cooked and delicious.  We received chocolate mousse for dessert  because the restaurant was celebrating its 23 anniversary.  That says a lot for this restaurant.  We will return. ",4
" Probably one of the worst dining experiences. Our waiter was very honest when I asked him if they make their own pasta. The answer was NO. They ship all their pasta in. The lemon rice soup was very delicious. Wine prices were reasonable, and you may notice the pasta prices are comparable to Italy prices; however, the taste is not. ",2
 Inviting atmosphere with wonderful service especially at the bar during happy hour and afterwards in the dining room for dinner. A great happy hour wine list with wonderful choices and appetizers at it more than reasonable price. Dinner entrée excelled. Service at both bar and dinner table were exceptional. ,5
" Very nice for a girls lunch out, food was quite good and service was nice. So nice to find a place where we could actually have conversations. ",4
" Great service, excellent meal, great presentation, very good house wines.  Alexi's is one of my favorite spots in Phoenix! ",5
 We had a large group of 20 girls. Our server was absolutely amazing. He did all separate checks with ease and efficiency and dealt with our ups and downs as more drinks were consumed ;) This was by far the best service I've ever had with a large party. Highly recommended for large groups! ,5
 Service is the best! Food was very good too. Great place for a date. ,5
 We  enjoyed our  evening. Food was good👋🍤🥙🍷🎾 we will be returning in two weeks ,5
 Menu too limited  Flavors not well balanced ,2
" Top of the Rock looks very 70's but that's fun. The view is fabulous! The Pho entree was soo interesting and flavorful. Overall, it was good - I don't feel compelled to rush back. ",3
" Food was exceptional, view was spectacular. The perfect place to go eat with your woman. ",5
" The food was good, not exceptional. Wine selection was aboveboard. Good for groups or a work dinner out, not so much for an anniversary. ",3
" The Top of the Rock salad was ok for a salad, exactly what it was billed as but not sure what the pomegranate added to the dish. The scallops were cooked perfectly, so tender. I am not a big risotto fan but the creaminess of the risotto with the sweetness of the peas complimented the scallops and were brought up a bit by the spiciness of the popcorn. Who knew popcorn could be so spicy! I wanted to get the peanut butter cheesecake for dessert but the waitress said they were between their seasonal menus and it was not longer available, which was a bummer but I would definitely check this place out again on subsequent trips to Phoenix. ",3
 Great food. Great view. Great staff.  I would recommend going for any type of special occasion with nice company and just enjoy your evening overlooking the city! ,5
 We have dined at the Top of the Rock many times before and always have a wonderful expeerience. We will definitely return. ,4
 Awesome valentine special. Food was great as well as the service..Veiw is spectacular. ,5
 One of my favorite places in Phoenix. Always a treat. ,5
" Nice location, pretty basic menu and a limited wine list ",3
" One of the best kept secrets of the Valley. Take those who you want to impress. Great food, service and views! ",5
" The best thing about the restaurant is the view. Seems to be a disconnect between what it wants to be (high-end) and what it serves up (pricey food noted on a cheesy menu). Whoever came up with the idea of putting the menu on plank boards should be shot. It just doesn't fit. But the night we were there, we all enjoyed our meal: filet, salmon, and short ribs. The calamari starter was excellent, as was the spinach salad, even if the waitress forgot (?) to mention there was duck in it. Seems an odd oversight, or just not knowledgeable about the menu. I was there a few years ago, and it was a much classier place. ",3
 Just not a good overall experience which is to bad as the location and view are quite impressive ,2
 Food was great but a little on the salty side. ,4
" The food was terrible, both my steak dinners were like leather. The A/C would not turn off. The waiters didnt know what was going on with the menue. The menue was ver limited. ",1
" Great views of the valley, but the food was very average. ",3
" It's been a while since we dined at Top of the Rock, and sadly it has gone downhill. The food was so-so (tough short ribs?). The wait staff tried very hard, but seemed inexperienced. The dining room still has a lovely view - good thing that hasn't changed! ",3
" What use to a an elegant place has apparently decided to ""down-grade"" into an upscale cowboy/causal restaurant. Can't say they pulled if off, especially with regard to the pricing. ",2
 Top of the Rock is a great restaurant. I surprised my wife with New Years dinner there as we wernt able to celebrate New Years Eve together due to my work. The setting there at the Buttes resort along with the ambiance of the restaurant impressed us right away. Our waitress was very knowledgeable and friendly. We ordered the calamari starter and rib eye entree. Both were excellent and tasted great. I highly recommend Top Of The Rock for a romantic dinner with your significant other. The view is simply amazing and sharing it with my beautiful wife made it that much better. ,5
" What a great meal, everytime I'm in Phoenix I try to eat here and a couple other places. Service is always spot on and the chef makes the best food. I will be back. ",5
" We decided to have dinner here due to the fact that we were staying at the resort. The night we were there the restaurant was not very busy. I would say that less than half the tables were occupied. Even with the low occupancy it still took over two hours to have dinner. I felt that was an extremely long time for a party of two. As to the food, my wife ordered the baked chicken and was very pleased with it. I ordered the ribeye and it arrived very under cooked. I will say that the manager did stop by while doing general rounds of the restaurant and asked how everything was. He offered to send it back to the kitchen, but with the extremely long time for us to get our meal I was hesitant to the thought of that. Overall it wasn't worth the $$$ ",2
" I was host to a party of 4. The location is the highlight. The waitress was very pleasant and helpful, especially with one of my guests who is lactose intolerant. The food was well prepared in contemporary style, without being over ornate. I did find my shrimp starter and scallop entree both rather dark in appearance, and with overly strong flavored garnishes so that the shellfish flavors were somewhat lost. The best entree was a petit filet steak which looked perfectly cooked.  The ambience is quite good, but still a bit of a compromise, with a bar area (with TV) by the entrance, so that it does not accomplish the feel of a 100% restaurant. ",4
" As other reviewers have said, this restaurant's great view is perfect for a romantic date, or for a night to show friends and family a beautiful example of why you moved to Phoenix. Even the short drive up the hill to the entrance has a great resort feel and helps set the stage. The problem is the food. It's not that it's bad, it's just that it has great potential but doesn't quite get there. Most of the items on the menu are a little unusual, some with unique combinations, but not weird. There's an emphasis on locally grown ingredients, which is great. However, we were left wondering if the chef actually tastes the creations. All in all though it was a great night out, in an upscale yet comfortable place, with great service. ",4
" I have not eaten at this spot for several years. The views have always been great but the food was just average. The menu is pretty simple but lots of local ingredients. I have to say I was very surprised. The food was great, simply presented and well done! Tried the Scallops , Shortribs, and the Squash Bisque was exceptional. Desert was very good also. I am for sure going back. Nice work Top of the Rock. ",4
 It was a rainy night. The roof was leaking right above where I was sitting. We had to change tables. Other than that this was a perfect place to celebrate our 4th wedding anniversary. It had good food and a great view of the valley. We even received a delicious anniversary dessert on the house. ,4
" The staff was OK, the food was OK, The view was amazing - other than it was in my hotel I don't thin I would have gone there. Pretty lackluster. ",2
" I went on a Monday and the whole resturant was empty, I was happy we got the whole resturant to ourselves, the food was very flavorful but not enough on the menu to choose from and the portions where small, I wanted to go somewhere romantic and this is the perfect place but if you came here for the food you won't get much . Me and my boyfriend love to chow down and we couldn't here . The service was great she let us know what we were eating the ingredients and how it tasted . ",5
" Amazing meal, great service. A must go. ",5
" The food was just ok for the price they were charging. Not even free bread, and the take out box looks so cheap. The waiter though kept busy changing out silverware, he forgot to give me my set for the main course. Not up to par for a fancy restaurant, except for the view. Would not recommend to friends. ",1
 The only thing it has going for them is the view. Food and service were fair at best. The food is overpriced for what you get and service was very slow. ,2
" I didn't realize that ""Pork Belly"" meant huge chunks of fat. I tried to cut it off and just eat the lean pieces, but I still ended up with over a cup of lard on my plate (I'm not exaggerating!) and a stomach ache. : ( ",2
 Food was okay but no flexibilty in prep despite the lack of diners (or maybe that explains the lack of diners). NY steak was not a great cut. Service was lackluster and wait person while pleasant was not very knowledgeable about menu and preparation and was somewhat pedestrian in mannerisms. Wine list was not very good. View was beautiful. ,2
 Great location for a special occasion where the ambiance is more important than the food. The view is spectacular; the food not so much. ,2
" Our waiter was great but the food came out of the kitchen and it wasn't warm, much less hot. ",2
" Great happy hour, even on Saturday! Service was excellent. Not pushy and let us relax and enjoy our meal and the view. ",4
 Food tasted great but some of the appetizers were very small portions. ,4
" Overall it was very good, The calmari was a bit over cooked and my husband chicken from the pink dinner was over cooked (dry) ",4
" We had a wonderful dinner at Top of The Rock! There were 5 of us and each one of us enjoyed everything that we ordered. The amuse bouche, made with a fig chili puree, baked plum and goat cheese did exactly what it was meant to do....make us want more! All of the entrees were savory and the deserts were delicious. The managers, servers, Chef Akos and all who waited on us make this place one that we look forward to coming back to. Thank you Top of The Rock. ",5
" What a view!  The food is great here with a nice selection of options, many of them locally grown.  The waitstaff were very friendly and extremely well informed.  Lets not fool around though, it's the view that's the biggest thing here.  It's awesome.  Recommended! ",4
" Food was wonderful and fresh, I love the place! ",4
 The service was very slow even though it wasn't busy. We had to wait 10 minutes before anyone even came to our table. The food lacked flavor and we were very dissapointed with what looked like it could have been a good menu. We will not go back and not recommend this restaurant to anyone. What a shame since the ambiance was pretty nice. ,1
 We were disappointed that there was not a white Zinfandel on the wine list. The wine we chose was just average. The salads were pretty good. The service was excellent. ,5
 Hostess was excellent in finding a quiet location for a meeting during lunch ,1
 I loved the different seating options and the decor. Service was great and the food delicious! ,4
" This was quite a disappointment. In the request section of the reservation, I had requested a booth or private seating because we were celebrating our anniversary. We were seated outside at a table- not a booth. Our appetizer was delivered by a very young looking man before we ever got our drinks. Our entrees were then brought over soon after we got our appetizers. The short ribs with polenta were delicious but the swordfish was dry &amp; bland. This is not what we expected at a 5-star hotel. We don't need to go back. ",2
" Food was very so so. All sounded good and we like the trail of 4 bites for $5.00, but really found nothing that interested us. Sorry. ",3
 Our onion soup never came; waitress said it was her fault.  Went for dinner; the vegetables were much too crunchy and undercooked and sent back. More flovorable when cooked a little more. We were given one free desert. ,3
" My overall experience was ok, but our table seemed like an afterthought when it came to service. Our original server ran around for over 15 minutes until a second server came to take our drink and dinner order. By the time we got to dessert, she went home and we had a third server. As for the food, it was good but didn't live up to all the hype. The food seemed pretty basic and needed a touch more seasoning. The best part was the ambiance. The outdoor patio is very romantic and peaceful. ",3
" The ambiance is nice ~ however, I do believe the restaurant is way over HYPED UP!  Dining inside Frank &amp; Albert's reminded me of sitting inside an upscaled DENNY'S, however with exorbitant prices!! The atmosphere didn't appeal to as I thought I would expect dining at the Arizona Biltmore ~ but what can I say?  There is a lovely outside patio, but I was not given the option of selecting to dine outside.  With that said, the food was really good, however the service was extremely poor.  The waitress did not have but two tables and she was constantly forgetting to bring out what we ordered from drinks, appetizers to a side item.  Being that it was a special day for me, Mother's Day, the whole dining experience was an absolute let down. ",3
" Our servers seemed to lack organization. First we sat for about 10 minutes until someone came and took our drink order. Then another server came by and said she would be our server even though the other one had already taken our order. Then the 1st server came and brought our drinks and she continued to serve us. When she finally came and took our order, she forgot me. Finally, when they brought our food, they set the orders down in front of the wrong people. Otherwise the food was fantastic, enjoyed the dining experience immensely. ",4
" We went for lunch and spent the rest of the afternoon there, dining, shopping,and relaxing. It was just so pleasant we hated to leave. And the food was excellent! ",5
" Service tends to be a little slow, no matter what time of day/night I'm there. ",3
 Amazing food. Great atmosphere. ,5
 I was hosting the management team and needed to make sure they would be impressed with the food. Everything was fantastic!! ,5
" Energetic is not good. Would prefer quiet, less vibrant ambiance. Energetic and vibrant do not equal class. ",4
" This is essentially a hotel restaurant so the menu has to appeal to a broad range of tastes. Entree selections include several ""comfort food"" items. It was well-prepared and presented but not exciting. Some daily specials might help enliven the menu and show off the chef's abilities.  We enjoyed the meal but as local diners with so many choices, probably won't go back. ",4
" Absolutely outstanding. William, our server, knew the menu inside and out and took care of our every need. The food was beyond excellent and the cotton candy at the end of the meal was a great touch! ",5
 A special thank you to our Breakfast waitress (Victoria). Victoria waited on us both mornings. She remembered our special requests and brought humor and a delicious breakfast! ,5
 In the past we have had a great time with guests at Biltmore. This time service was not only indifferent but did not exist. Completely loused up the food order of one of our guests. ,1
" Did not know there were daily specials. Unfortunately, I wanted prime rib but that was only offered Friday-Sunday.Mor of a relaxed atmosphere than I expected. Would rate the restaurant as casual. ",4
" This was my fourth time dining at Frank &amp; Albert's and, unfortunately, each time I go the service declines. This time upon arrival the hostesses were concerned with anything but greeting us. When my party of 8 did finally get seated, after nearly 15 min. of no one approaching our table, we asked a server to at least take our drink order, to which he replied ""as long as it is not too difficult"". After that I tracked down one of the managers who attempted to resolve the issues, but the service still was not what it used to be before being owned by Hilton. The food itself was, as always, great, but is starting to not be worth enduring the poor service. ",3
" We go to the Biltmore every Easter, love the holiday festivities. ",4
" We came to Frank &amp; Alberts based on reviews we had read for my husband's birthday. We were looking for an outdoor restaurant and love the Arizona Biltmore so it seemed like this restaurant would be a nice fit. Overall we enjoyed the outdoor ambience alot and the food was tasty, but not outstanding. Unfortunately, the lack of professional service was a real downer to the overall experience. The server was slow to get to us throughout the evening and was too casual in her approach (more like a diner server than a server at a nice restaurant), which meant drinks were not refilled, bread was not replaced, even when we asked and dishes were not cleared.  Two of our party tried the buffet for $25.00 and were underwhelmed by the quality. ",3
 i think one order of tacos got wasabi sauce instead of avocado (sauce)!!!! ,3
" what a beautiful place! We sat outside and had drinks and appetizers. There are fires to sit by if you are chilled, the flowers and the building itself are beautiful. I wish we could have stayed longer. The food is very good and the prices were surprisingly reasonable. ",4
 We went after a tour of the hotel. We were seated promptly on the shaded patio. My husband had a wonderful salad (huge) and I tried the fish tacos at the recommandation of the server. He was right - they were delightful. It was a lovely lunch. ,4
" Loved the entire evening! Started at Frank and Alberts for dinner and finished with a dessert souffle at Wright's. Outstanding food in both places, made for a wonderful evening. Definitely wil return to the Biltmore. ",5
" not busy but service was not attentive. The restaurant was empty when we arrived and then a party of 16 arrived, tables were moved together and the noise became unbearable. ",3
" From the moment we arrived at the restaurant we knew that service wasn't going to be at the top of their mind. The Maitre d' was talking to a server and just told us to wait a minute. Our server told us when we ordered just to make sure to remind him if he forgot anything. As a very high maintenance table arrived, we became not even a second or third thought to him. Even getting the check proved to be a nuisance. Despite this the food was delicious and quite the value. ",1
" We celebrated a 70th birthday there, and when we mentioned it was for a birthday, they had a spectacular ""sampler"" dessert with a birthday candle, and it was free! It's a super, comfortable, relaxed place. ",4
" Menu selection was great, &amp; food taste excellent! Service knowledgeable, personable &amp; helpful. ",5
" We've been here many times and the food, service and ambiance have never disappointed. This time was no exception - friendly hostess, pleasant and knowledgeable server, delicious appetizer (macaroni and cheese bites - a fancier twist on comfort food), incredible entree (the grilled swordfish was so juicy and almost crispy on the outside - how do they do that? ), decadent dessert (bananas foster sundae - tons of delicious chocolate and banana). Oh, I nearly neglected to mention the cocktails, which are always delicious here! It was a lovely meal, which was perfect because we were celebrating our first anniversary. I'd highly recommend Frank and Albert's, and we'll probably see you there! ",5
" We dined on a Wednesday night, which helped to keep it quiet. The food was amazing, the service fantastic, and the attention from everyone, including the chef was amazing. We started with the empanadas, then had the meat loaf, and sausage flat bread, and ended with roasting s'mores at our table. We left with a lot of food in our doggie bag and full bellies. We enjoyed ourselves so much we were there for over 2 hours! AMAZING. We will be back! ",5
" We had terrible service (not coming to our table for 10 minutes, not serving us drinks for another 10 minutes, forgetting to give us bread until our food came, not refilling drinks, not checking on our table to see if we needed anything) and when we tried to speak to the manager about it, he was very condescending and rude. He informed us that he was sorry that ""we felt that way"" and that he knew it wasn't the intention of the server to treat us that way. However, at no point did he simply say he was sorry; we felt he made excuses and did not take accountability for the situation. What a dissapointment, because we love the Biltmore. We were extremely saddened by how we were treated, and underwhelmed with the experience. ",1
" We had a wonderful meal at Frank and Albert's on Valentine's Day. We had a reservation and were seated promptly at a table that could view outside through large windows and also the serving line(exposed for ambiance) just close enough for entertainment. The tables are without linen and it can be a little loud/lively rather than formal (perfect). We ordered from a special menu for the day that came with a wine pairing for each course. Everything was excellent, especially our fillets which were flavorful and cooked to order. All the food was extremely fresh. The service was excellent, attentive but not intrusive. Our server offered helpful suggestions and really cared about the quality of our meal down to the smallest parts of the courses. ",5
" Very fast service, food was excellent! ",5
" This place was outstanding in every way. We were only in Phoenix for 4 nights. After going here one evening we only wanted to return. The food is fantastic and the service very attentive and friendly. My favorite thing, though, was the atmosphere. We loved the fire pits and the outdoor seating. The Happy Hour is not to be missed! ",5
 My two clients had the prime rib and loved it...I had short ribs...tasty but tuff presentation was very nice. service was ok....not great but maybe he was new... ,3
" Ambiance was very good, although when a large group came in and took over, we were unable to hear each other to have conversation over our own table. The service was horrible. Example: we were given dessert menus and then the waitperson disappeared for a good 15 or 20 minutes and only came back over because we hailed her down. The food was passable. The burger was pretty good, but the pizza was not as described on the menu. ",2
 We came with a pre paid gift voucher and thoroughly enjoyed our time there. We look forward to returning again and have thoughts of giving someone else the opportunity of dining at Frank &amp; Alberts through a gift voucher as well. Very Nice! ,5
" We have our team lunches here a few times a year. The food is always excellent. I always have the Salmon Special, but it however they cook it, the salmon is always incredible. ",5
 Nataly the waitress was outstanding. ,5
" We had dinner at Frank and Albert’s Restaurant located at the historic Arizona Biltmore on a rainy November evening. The architect for the Arizona Biltmore , built in 1929, was Frank Lloyd Wright. Everyone was friendly from the hostess to the waiter. The new restaurant is built in the post 1920’s style, very sleek and stylish. The food is comfort food American. My husband had a Waldorf salad and their famous tortilla soup. I indulged in the special prime rib served with a baked potato and broccoli. Every bite was expertly prepared and delicious. Nothing fancy, simple, yet tasty. Despite the rain, the grounds were lovely, the outdoor fire pits provided some warmth and it was wonderful to experience the glamour and beauty of a bygone era/ ",4
 Lunch is very good. Had the grass feed burger and was pleased with the flavor. Servicee was great ,4
 Late night meal had good food. NY Strip was very good. Brisket was dry. Good wine selection. Service was good. ,4
" Service was terrible. Salads had very little spinach in them. Wait staff would give out drinks but neglect to remove items from the table, and that's WHEN they would give refills. I had to signal the manager just to get another ice tea. We were told we could not move tables around to get out of the sun and then a different wait staffer said we could. Very inconsisant. Not at all what we expect from the Biltmore. ",2
" Food was very good all around the table with one criticism, relative to all the other portions and prices (a little high for portion size), the fried chicken was a small frenched thigh. Maybe 4 ounces of meat. If you are going to charge $25 for chicken, give 2 thighs! ",4
 We love dining at Frank and Albert's. Things were a bit slow on this evening. ,3
" The price and remote location of this restaurant (inside the Biltmore) did not make this experience all that special. Honestly, it wasn't as good much less posh places such as The Cheesecake Factory. Indeed, the dessert menu was rather pedestrian, so we decided to go to Seasons 52 instead and that short experience was much better than the time spent here. Frank &amp; Albert's benefits greatly from its location, but that location is not amazing nor rather memorable. In short, I have no intention of returning to either the Biltmore or this restaurant. ",3
 One of my favorites. A real plus for a great resort. Btw their onion rings are the best !! ,5
" Only nice thing was the food. Apart from this the server was new and lacked confidence. In Open Table I put in a note that stated the dinner was a night out for husband and wife, requesting a romantic table/view. We where sat directly next to the bar, close to a noisy kitchen line and a server station. To top off the evening the main courses took 30 plus minutes to arrive. The server tired to comp a dessert which didn't repair the experience because I had to request the comp, this should have been offered. ",2
" Our family meal about 6pm on a Sunday was very enjoyable. Good food and attentive, though not hovering, service. ""My pleasure"" was head and shoulders above the now ubiquitous ""no problem"", though even it wore thin. Food quality is consistent with a brand like Biltmore. Pricing reflects a slight premium from the 'resort' nature of the property. ",4
 Food was very well prepared from a small menu. The setting is the star here. ,4
 we tried the resturant twice and it was poor both times. Took more than an hour for the food to come each time - food was just ok ,1
" Our waitress ""Z"" (from Bosnia) was outstanding, as was our lunch. It was a special occasion birthday lunch for one of our group and she was treated to a special dessert on the house. The food was deliscious! ",4
" This was our first (and last) visit to Frank &amp; Alberts. We were celebrating my brothers birthday. My brother ordered a burger &amp; fries which he said were ""ok"" tasting. I had the fish tacos which looked way better than they tasted. Very bland. You could take a lesson on how to make fish tacos from Del Friscos at The Biltmore. Theirs blow yours away. My husband ordered the beef dip and said he wouldn't order it again. Boring &amp; tasteless. I thought well maybe the dessert could save the day but that didn't happen either. We wanted the tableside smores but were informed by our waiter they just changed the menu THAT VERY DAY and those were no longer available. Disappointing. The carrot cake was not terrific either. ",2
" My wife and I ordered gluten free options. The tortilla soup and ceasar salad were nice, pizza was good, the rotissiere chicken, very good, and the chocolate brulee a nice dessert to top off the meal. We dined early so the restaurant was not overly busy, we were able to have a conversation, we sat in the back looking out to the grounds of the Biltmore. ",4
" I was ignored and skipped over while waiting to check in for my reservation. The appetizers were good. Waiter was short of personality as well as attention. Everything took forever. We were in no rush but water refills would be nice. The meals was just ok. Lacking in flavor, it all kinda just tasted bland. Dessert is highlight! The only reason to go back really would be the table side smors. Go eat somewhere for dinner then come here for dessert. ",3
 Didnt have enough servers for crowd. ,3
 The prime rib is not the dinner to order. Tough as shoe leather. Waited a long time to get bill and once it was brought we waited 15 minutes for the waiter to come back and pick it up. ,3
 Delicious food and a helpful service. Anyone staying at the Biltmore should try this restaurant during their stay. ,5
 Food was adequate - not great. Menus were paper and stained.... Expected more. ,3
" sevice and food were outstanding, we always enjoy visiting the Biltmore! ",5
" Service was great, food was not so great. My chicken and macaroni dish was very bland and the chicken had very little flavor. My girlfriend's rotisserie chicken was also very bland as was her mashed potatoes. Fairly disappointing meal. ",2
 Everything was great. Service was great. Food was great. What can I say? ,5
 We had excellent service and very good food and wanted for nothing. ,4
" nice and friendly staff, food is divine ",4
" Food was the best! Thomas, our waiter was very helpful and gave us suggestions that exceeded our expectations. I was undecided on a pasta dish and a chicken dish. Thomas recommended the chicken with a side of pasta and both were outstanding. By the way, they are dog friendly on the patio which we have visited many times for happy hour with our 3 dogs. The waiter brought out some chopped chicken for the dogs at no charge. ",5
 I had the lamb chops &amp; thought they were so delicious! Cooked to perfection and such a flavorful rosemary (I think!) flavor to the sauce. Our waiter worked very hard to get us our food in a timely manner to make our after dinner show. Always a pleasure to eat here! ,5
" Everything was nice, but not offering the happy hour 10 feet from the bar to the dining room is insulting. ",4
" Our recent experience was way below average. Dinner was tasteless and over cooked.....Chicken Paillard. Vegetables uninteresting and salad limp with dressing. I do like the sedate ambiance and our waiter was terrific. Spot on service, friendly and jovial. Tough group to deal with, with meal splits, picky eaters and a request for separate checks. He handled it all with grace and humor. I hope they get a new Chef because that is all it would take, in my opinion, to make this a desirable central Phoenix eatery. ",2
" Alexi's has not failed me yet. Went for lunch with a co-worker for her birthday and we both had the chicken marsala. We both love mushrooms and there were plenty on the chicken which was very flavorful and served hot. The fresh vegetables which accompanied the meal were also quite delicious, you could tell the food was prepared to order not sitting in a tray waiting for the next order. A long time lunch favorite. ",4
" great place for multi-occaisions...great ambiance, food &amp; service...don't pass this one up! ",5
" Great find. Took my picky Mom. Her comment says it all "" Best lamb I've had since I left New York."" She left NY 55 years ago! We arrived early and were allowed to come in a sit with a drink while they finished setting up. Very accommodating, very friendly. ",5
 We can always depend on an excellent meal at Alexi's. It makes a wonderful spot to go to before a concert or the opera. ,5
 Is the adjective which comes to mind. Excellent relationship quality/service vs price. And being able to make reservations via Open Table is an excellent feature! ,4
 I love Alexi's Grill because it's a great place for lunch or dinner. We had dinner and a meeting and it allows for that to happen. Great staff who do a good job each time you visit. ,5
" Waited 10 mins for water, an additional 10 mins to get menus, and had to wave down the server to order. The waiter brought the wrong food items ordered. Had to walk up to bar and ask for server to bring check which then took another 15 mins to process.  If you are looking for a quality dining experience to take a business client this may not be the place for you! ",1
" excellent fresh fish; excellent pasta, truly nice professional staff ",5
" The tomato sauce served with the calamari and the baked mozzerela was very salty anhad know flavor. The baked mozzerela tasted like it came from the freezer. Some of our entrees were good, but others were bland. Their expresso machine was broke. ",2
" Alexi's, thank you for a wonderful dining experience. The menu variety was perfect and the aroma, taste and presentation of the entrees was outstanding. Thanks for being in Phoenix. ",4
 I always enjoy eating at Alexi's because the staff is very friendly and accomodating. The food is excellent and it never seems to be too loud. It is a nice restaurant to have a business lunch or just enjoy it with friends. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good restaurant in Phoenix! ,5
" The location, the absolutely delicious food, the impressive clientele , topped with the wonderful service staff all combine to make this restaurant a definite 'must'...... ",5
" This was our first and probably last visit to Alexi. Up to the entrees it was scoring maximum marks, then our waiter was dealing with another table and you know what happens to food left on the passé it gets cool and fish overcooks. The halibut was well over on the edges but ok in the middle whilst the rack of lamb was just ok. I wanted to send it back but my dining partner did not want to make a fuss. There were other wait staff on duty doing nothing, so why did they not bring the food? ",3
" Our group of nurses love the staff , service, wonderful ambience makes the food taste taste even better. Have had only positive comments from people we've brought there. Especially love the salmon. ",5
" We can always count on Alexi's Grill for a delicious meal. The food is consistently delicious and the service is superb. In particular, the fish is fresh as can be and cooked to perfection (halibut). Having the owner cruise the dining room to ensure satisfaction with a friendly demeanor is an added bonus that is rare these days. We highly recommend! ",5
 waiter too quick in removing plates...not quite finished but he just grabbed the plate while my friend was talking :-( ,5
" I found this place due to Open Table. I was downtown and hungry and Italian sounded good. The salad was good, the bread was nice, and the main course was good. What really made this experience memorable was the service. The hostess (whom I later found out was on her first day) was fantastic from the get go. My service was knowledgeable and personable. The managing partner, Michael, spent at least a 1/2 hour just talking to me and my girlfriend. He was amazing. Even the regulars that I met at the restaurant were great.  I want to go back and try more menu items just because I have never in my life had such great service. We will be going back. ",5
" If you are looking for outstanding food at a reasonable price, this is the place for you. I had grilled salmon and my partner had grilled halibut. The fish was cooked perfectly, served in a generous portion, and presented beautifully on the plate. The vegetable sides were also cooked perfectly and delicious. The wine list has some great choices at reasonable prices. We will be back. ",4
" The fish tacos (on the lunch menu) were fantastic! The pasta with artichokes, olives and shrimp (on the dinner menu) was very good but not great; it was so salty that it was hard to taste all the other wonderful flavors in the dish (a common problem among restaurants everywhere these days, I'm afraid). Service was very attentive. ",4
" - Service was a bit off - BUT the kitchen more than made up for it...had the grilled Salmon and the fried chicken steak - both were incredible. Tip: Ask for a booth along the window, not an incredible view but if its too hot to sit outside - either way, your attention will be focused on the delicious entrees! Highly recommend.  Final thought: Skip the dessert, they aren't focused in this area - management is aware but an after dinner port in the lobby lounge is a much better option than the dense, a bit try Chocolate Raspberry Cake... ",5
" Our family habitat is spread across the Valley, and sometimes difficult to find a suitable central location, but the Arizona Biltmore was perfect for our family celebration of three birthdays. The food was very good and provided an opportunity for a choice of breakfast or lunch items. And, the Arizona Biltmore is a beautiful surrounding for any and all events (I wouldn't understand how anyone would not find it a beautiful place.) ",5
" Loved everything about the restaurant. food, service and, of course, the architecture! ",5
 Had their prime rib special. A ton of food for the money and very tasty! ,4
 Wonderful experience. The service was personal and outstanding. We had the pizza and what a treat! Thin crust and all fresh ingredients. The onion rings were very unique and oh so tasty! If you are headed to or around the Biltmore Frank &amp; Albert's is a must see! Enjoy!! ,5
" Went Sunday and not up to previous standards. I wanted their great omelette and they had run out of mushrooms, bacon, cheese and it was only around noon. I mean this is the Biltmore not McDonalds. Come on guys, you are better than this. Service was fine. Food was good but you shouldn't run out when charging these prices! ",2
 Fantastic! We enjoyed it so much we went backFor lunch the next day. ,5
" I had high hopes for this restaurant, but reality fell far short of my expectations. The space and the food both seemed, well, tired and unimaginative. Disappointing, especially considering the inflated resort prices. ",2
" Place was attractive but ""commercial Food was barely edible. ",2
" There with a special friend, it was her first time and she loved the food and the ambiance. ",5
 the experience using stars above says it all ,1
" Ate there three times because I was attending a conference. The hamburger and tortilla soup were excellent, but the remainer of the menu was not well executed. Service was excruciatingly slow two of the three times we were there. The food was quite overpriced for what was served. While this might be a place for a bite while staying at the hotel, if you have the time, you should consider going off property. ",2
" It was very kid friendly, and that was what I was not expecting- I was hoping for a nice evening out and was greeted by 2 year olds whining all around me. Food was great, location was great, dinner at sunset was perfect- just didn't realize it was 'fit for all ages' ",4
 OUTSTANDING SERVICE ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS FOOD GREAT PRICES CONSISTENTLY IMPRESSIVE FAMOUS RESTAURANT ,5
" We celebrated a birthday and thanked employees for great work! It's a perfect place for a lovely lunch that affordable, elegant and special. ",4
 consistently great! ~ luv this place! ,5
" Great for work lunches, a nice touch for recognition. Has an upscale look and feel with reasonable prices. ",5
 I keep going back to Alexi's because the food is consistently good and I know I can rely on it when I take a client to lunch. I am always satisfied. ,5
 I have been to Alexi's several times for lunch. It is a great place to meet and eat with a professional colleague. ,5
 The food and service were excellent. ,5
 Alexi's was recommended by friends who are regulars. A bit of a drive for us but worth it. Had the halibut which was outstanding. Everyone liked their food. Fish was a bit pricey but its recommended here. They know how to pick and prepare it. Would definitely go back. Reasonable price on house wine. Happy hour was buzzing. Can't wait for the patio weather. The patio looks awesome. ,4
 It was obvious that this was a nice family restaurant the minute we arrived. The food was great and the service was also. Check it out if you are in Phoenix! ,4
" Very nice, locally owned establishment. In fact, they've had the same chef since they opened and we were told the most of the wait staff &amp; bartender had been there for around 10 years. That speaks volumes for how the place is run. And the food is very good, too. We had a fishy night - appetizers of shrimp, calamari &amp; tortellini - all very delicious. So nice not to get rubbery calamari! Halibut flaky and moist as was the grilled salmon - beautifully presented. ",4
" Alexi's is truly a neighborhood gem. There lovely dining room, great food and superior service is a testament to a lovely restaurant for family, friends and work associates. I enjoy this place for lunch--it's a great place for a business meeting. It was my first time using Open Table for a reservation and I loved it! ",5
" Alexi's Grill is a great find and we will be back. Everything was very good and even though the drive from Chandler AZ to Phoenix is a long one, Alexi's is worth the drive. ",4
" Many thanks for a nice quiet dinner, with great food of course! ",5
" Really appreciated the location of the table. We were all getting together for the first time, having spent months on line and the phone. My friend and I flew in from Santa Cruz, CA to meet with these gentlemen, a result of my Father's having been put in the Arizona Aviation Hall of Fame. These gentlemen were responsible for all the research and background necessary for this Honor, and we wished to meet and thank them all.  The service was perfect and the Waiter kindly allowed us to stay at the table long after the dishes had been cleared. We really appreciated it.  A delightful meeting, and wonderful food and ambiance. Will definitely recommend it to others. ",5
" We had made a reservation and requested a table by the window. When someone called from the restaurant to reconfirm a couple of hours before dinner, I reconfirmed the table by the window. Our table was ready, was in a great location, and the restaurant was comfortable and attractive (if just a little drab). The food and service were just fine. The waiter was pleasant and courteous and got our orders correct...........The hostess was very pleasant. The food was done properly and was nicely presented. ",4
 Service was outstanding. Waiters were knowledgable. ,5
" We brought a group of customers for dinner while in town and had a fantastic meal. Food was great, service was exceptional and the overall experience was awesome. Our customers were very impressed. We recommended to a couple others while here for the conference. ",5
 very much enjoyed the calamari steak &amp; salmon dishes ,4
" Excellent, attentive staff, but not overly and bothersome. Foot was outstanding and portions just right. Friendly place all around. ",5
 Food worthy of an assisted living facility.  Don’t go here if you still have the teeth you were born with. ,2
" Great food, service was amazing. It’s definitely a place I’ll be dining in again. ",5
 The lobster ravioli were light.  Salad was fresh.  Prices were reasonable ,4
 First time at this restaurant. One of the first things the waiter said to us was are we going to the theater. As a matter of fact we were and so very pleased that he thought to ask so that there was time to finish our meal comfortably. The waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu items and service was excellent. The food was very good but more impressed with the excellent value. The patrons seemed to be a mixture of local regulars and the pre-theater types. I would recommend. ,4
 We enjoyed our Tapas in the lounge. We always enjoy our visit to Alexis ,5
 We always enjoy our time there! Delicious food! They cater to dietary needs. The staff is friendly. ,5
" We were celebrating our wedding anniversary. This was our first time at this restaurant. Although  It was a 35 minute drive from North Scottsdale, I would make it our business to return to this wonderful restaurant. The service was excellent, food and presentation was outstanding, and  very reasonable prices. Definitely the best value we have found in the valley for the quality of the meal. They also brought us 2 amazing desserts on the house. I’m sure it will be a regular  destination and make sure to order the veal chop. ",5
" Fabulous Food, great service and reasonable pricing make this restaurant a definate come back again place.  Came early for our reservation and were seated after just a short wait.  Nice that the tables are not crowded together.  Great coffee and dessert made the evening perfect. ",5
" Been there many times, usually lunch, but Saturday nights dinner was wonderful. Had nice table by the window, and Thomas our server was just great. BruceV ",4
 No surprises.  Just as good as always!  Had the roast duck a l'orange.  It was perfect -- nice and crispy without being dried out.  Split the Caesar salad.  It is quite sufficient for two. ,4
 Took my family and out of town visitor to dinner at Alexi's Grill.  It was the first time for my invited guests and they were all awed at the food and friendliness of the staff.  Even the owner stopped by to greet all of us.  Very impressive! ,5
" The food was solid, but the service was extremely poor. We both had chicken dishes and they had good flavor, the dinner salad was also surprisingly good. Prices are very reasonable! Our server was inattentive and dismissive although he was able answer some questions about gluten free options. The outdoor area was cute, we were unable to sit outside because of a large party. ",3
 Food was great! ,4
 The service was superb. The food was very tasty. A very enjoyable evening. ,5
" Everyone was pleasant, but our waiter was stiff and had no recommendations. ",4
" Met my  granddaughter and great grandson (2 yrs) here for late lunch.  Business  workers were finishing up their lunch and leaving.  Restaurant was quiet, so good for conversation.  Waiter was prompt and unobtrusive so that was a plus.  Water on rocks outside the entrance was a very pleasing visual. Owner was attentive and friendly. ",4
" As always, Alexi's Grill is a a dining pleasure. The food is always delicious — the gyros are amazing — and the staff is at the top of their game. I highly recommend this restaurant for business luncheons. ",5
 It was our first time there and we loved it!! ,5
 The menu for New Years Eve was extensive.  Food was very good and the service was excellent. ,4
" Alexi's is our favorite restaurant for special occasions and pre-theatre dinners.  It has a great atmosphere and is good for quiet conversation.  The food is outstanding and the menu is very diverse.  This evening, my daughter and I enjoyed the poached salmon and my husband had the very tasty lamb shank. ",5
" A New Year's Eve special is Duck with Orange Sauce (or Peppercorn Sauce).  The Duck was outstanding! Perfectly seasoned and cooked, tender and moist with a crisp skin.  The1  only minor drawback was the vegetable trio - the broccoli was tough and under cooked while the glazed carrots, while very tasty, were overcooked and almost mushy.  Our guests enjoyed a lovely rack of lamb and a beautiful salmon entree.  The service was excellent and the decor lovely for New Year's Eve. ",5
 It is a nice Italian restaurant like you would find in Eastern cities like South Philly. ,5
 Always great food and great service! A midtown Phoenix gem. ,5
" Service was good, very attentive. ",5
" We could not have asked for a nicer meal on Christmas Eve. The food was superb, the service was friendly and the noise level was so low we could hear each other!  It was truly a beautiful evening. ",5
 This is the second time we've been to Alexi's for dinner.  GREAT place.  Excellent food and service.  Fun atmosphere. ,5
 Very nice place for a good meal at a reasonable price. ,5
" What a pleasant find! Such good and interesting food, served in a casual, but comfortable and specialized atmosphere. Everything was great. The black and white attire of the staff was a real plus too. We will be back! ",5
" We took our daughter here for her birthday on her lunch break. We were a little short on time but the food came quickly and the server was always available. I had the Greek salad with the salmon. So nice to see a full salad with all the trimmings, big chunks of feta cheese, and a nice sized slab of salmon on top! The meal was wonderful - and reasonable in cost. An excellent meal!! ",5
 Because of the traffic we were late for our reservation and had to be out in time to get to Symphony. Alexi’s grill manage to do everything on time with delicious food and not feeling rushed. I have never Had a disappointing meal there. ,5
" We were there for business lunch.  It was a busy day and our server was a bit running around.  But, the food I ordered was grilled and it was done perfectly.  Main dish came with a salad; not fancy but was fresh.   Overall, this restaurant provides pleasant ambience and tasty food. ",4
 Very professional experienced waiters make this restaurant a special experience ,4
" We were first-time diners here. With all the great recommendations and high star ratings, we expected to be wowed. Unfortunately, we were massively disappointed.  Things started well with friendly greetings from both the hostess and our server. We placed our orders. The side salads arrived: crisp, chilled lettuce, well dressed. Sadly, things went downhill from there. The fettuccine Alfredo with chicken looked like soup because the wildly over salted sauce was much too thin to adhere to the pasta. The trout almandine - not great, but acceptable - was accompanied by cold vegetables: potatoes, undercooked, woody broccoli and sweet carrots. The choice of the latter to accompany the butter/lemon  fish was baffling.  Underwhelmed by the mains, we did not sample dessert. ",2
" WE have been dinning at Alexis for many years . We know what we going to get at this place . The food is allways good . We had the mussels to start. What a great choice. The ginger sauce was very tasty . The rack of lamb came out cooked perfectly. My wife had the halibut with the feta cheese. It melted in your mouth.They have the same servers for years . We know most of them by name . If you never been there , highly recommended. Will be back soon. ",5
" As always, great food &amp; service. Very nice! ",5
" Still one of the best business lunches in Phoenix. Great food, great services, good prices. ",5
" One entree was far too salty, the other far too sweet. The server needs to be working at a McDonalds. Great if you are 70+ (most of the people there were), have no taste buds left, and don't care about atmosphere. ",2
 I ordered my favorite as I don't get Filet Mignon too often and was really looking forward to it. Unfortunately this night it was not very good. It had no taste whatsoever which was very disappointing at $28.00 a plate. The veggies were very good and so was the dessert but was not happy with my steak. ,3
" This was my first visit to Alexi's despite having lived and worked in downtown Phoenix for over 15 years; the visit was suggested by my colleague/companion after reviewing the menu online. The food was acceptable; it was fresh and presented according to the menu description but the presentation was weak. The Shrimp Cocktails were nice - 5 large shrimp - but they arrived at the table on a salad plate, piled onto large leaves of what we saw later was the stock salad greens. The dinner salad was pretty good, but there's only one salad and one dressing on offer. The main courses were the same - decent but nothing special. For a $26 daily special plate, we expected something a little more interesting than broccoli and carrots. ",2
" I just moved to the neighborhood. I saw the great reviews and thought I would try it. I went with a friend. The food was good and so was the service. I would recommend it to others and will try to go back again. They had a small wine list, but everything was very very affordable ",3
 Had a great first experience with Open Door AND Alexi's. The management was very friendly and atmosphere was very quite and relaxing. Absolutely great lunch menu and food was awesome! ,5
 Always great for lunch. ,4
" Our birthday work group loves Alexi's. The waiters are outstanding, very attentive and funny! The food is always high quality. I love your new way of getting reservations also--on line. We have been to this venue many times. ",5
" This is beginning to be our favorite restaurant in Phoenix! We had the Lamb Chop and the Fettucini Alfredo, both exquisite. The house salad dressing alone is worth going again and again. Kudos to the chef! Our waitress was delightful and the - a Pinot Noir - wine she suggested (a Pinot Noir) was not only superb but also very reasonably priced. Although this was only our second visit the owner knew us by name and greeted us with the utmost hospitality. We plan to bring family on our next visit as this restaurant already feels like home! ",5
" The night was an abomination. We had a reservation and were seated right next to huge party of teenage girls with a few adults that did nothing to control their loud, rude disruptive behavior. We had to share a waiter so service was erratic. The staff also did nothing to control the group even as tables got up and left. Our drinks were comp'd but the dinners should have been because they couldn't be enjoyed. Catcalls from the group as we left. ",1
 We love to return to Alexi's to celebrate a special occasion. ,5
 I've been coming here for years and Alexi's never disappoints! Both service and food are always very good - and consistent. ,4
" We let them know we were on a tight schedule, so they were very accomodating &amp; we were able to eat lunch within an hour, including dessert. Much appreciated! ",4
" Service and food are top-notch. The owner, Michael is a class act as is his wait staff. Their seafood dishes are fabulous! ",5
 This was the first time since I have been going to Alexis that the service was terrible. Thank goodness the food more than made up for it and the manager came over and apologized.  The Athenian Halibut is always a great choice when the fish is fresh and in season.  I have never had a bad experience at Alexis  and always look forward to dining there. ,4
 It is always a treat to dine here.  The food is always delicious! ,5
 Alexi's never disappoints.  Food is always tasty and service is spot on.  They are very accommodating for theater-goers which we were that night. ,5
" A real gem. Fresh seafood, attentive service...always a great experience, and you never know who you might run into! ",5
 Alexi’s provided great food at a price about 25% below what I expect to pay at a white tablecloth restaurant. The calamari was an outstanding appetizer and everyone in my party enjoyed their meal. ,5
 We were greeted and treated well from the very beginning. Calamari was excellent ! ,4
" Loved this restaurant, the waiter, the food, and the service. We will definitely return soon! ",5
" This time the service was slow, but overall everything else was outstanding--as usual. ",5
" Considering how highly rated this place was, we were all kind of disappointed. Pity. ",2
" We love Alexi's Grill! The food is always very good and the staff is attentive. They have the best chicken parmasan in Phoenix and have a terrific selection of other seafood, veal, duck, lamb and pasta dishes. The location is perfect, directly on North Central (just North of Osborn) an easy hop in the car or on light rail to a Downtown Phoenix show or ballgame. Parking is easy, a surface lot directly adjacent to the restaurant. We have been dining here for years and have always had a great meal. ",5
 If you have not tried Alexi's Grill you are missing out. ,5
 Loved this place on Central. Small restaurant but food was really good! Great place to take work clients. ,4
" Superb management, great service, wonderful food and a convenient location says it all! ",5
" I was fortunate enough to be present for the tail end of happy hour, and on this day lamb was on the menu -- and it was wonderful! So good, in fact, that I ended up indulging my inner-glutton and ordering a second serving.  I have been to Alexi's before, and have never been disappointed. The staff is top-notch whether you sit at the bar, or a quiet table elsewhere in the restaurant, and is very attentive and positive. The owner always makes it a point to stop by and chat, and either the hostess or the owner thanks you for coming as you leave. Also highly recommended is the cod when it is available -- it was light and flaky and flavorful. The salmon is also excellent. And for dessert, try the spumoni. Just do it.  Highly recommend ",5
" Food was outstanding and at least one person in our group said that this was a ""find"" and will go back. ",5
 Best Veal Chop I've ever had; melted in my mouth. Carrots cooked perfectly. Chicken Rice Soup like Mother used to make. Will be back. ,5
" This was my first time at Alexi's Grill and I was pleasantly surprised by this hidden treasure. I took the suggestion of my waitress and had the Halibut Athenia. Simply Amazing. My husband had the Rack of Lamb and he is still raving about it. The calamari appetizer is the best calamari we have had in Phoenix, fried to perfection and drizzeled in olive oil and garlic. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. The owner himself greeted us at the door, and made us feel right at home. We will most certainly return! ",5
 Great food and service for our group of 10. Thanks ,5
 The food was excellent; the service from our waitstaff was very poor. We were asked if we wanted pepper for our salads. We said yes and she never brought it. The wrong bottle of wine was brought to us and the second bottle had to be asked for twice. ,4
 The soup this visit was beef &amp; barley. Humble? Yes. Delicious? Absolutely. So were the lamb and the chicken marsala. We'll keep coming back. ,5
" Great place, that perfect little Italian place we'd been looking for for a while. The mini garlic rolls that come with dinner become something you crave as well as their super-rich alfredo sauce. Chicken parm and picatta were exactly as expected and I will be going back for a while. ",5
" The Athenian Halibut special rocked. It was amazing. Nice place in the 1st floor of an office building. Some outside seating, but it was too cold when I visited. A lot of people talking, not quiet but not noisy. I'll be back to try their salmon. ",4
" Good Food, good service, and perfect when going downtown to the symphony, opera, theater or show. Let them know and they'll get you out in plenty of time. ",5
" Good food, but the ambiance was to nothing to write home about. ",4
" My wife and I celebrated with dinner on Valentines Day. The ambiance was nice, the food was excellent, service attentive a bit noisy due to a large group seated close by. Our only complaint was a special menu (pricier than normal) with limited entres which did not include italian dishes. ",4
" Was good time but a bit loud, probably cause it was valentines day. but good food very nice staff friendly and welcoming. ",4
" The Summer Time Drink, was an amazing cocktail our waiter recommended. Excellent ervice will definitely be back. ",5
 JUST GREAT PLACE! MY FIRST TIME WAS 16 YRS AGO AND IT IS JUST AS GREAT NOW. BILL ,5
 Enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant. It is on the quieter side so you can enjoy a good conversation. On a scale of 1-10 I would rate our meals as a 7. ,4
 Perhaps it was due to March madness but the only one working was the bus boy. Orders were mixed up..service was slow and dull. First time there and first impression we will NOT be returning. ,2
 SECOND TIME FOR US AND IT WAS JUST AS GOOD AS THE FIRST. WE'LL BE BACK. ,4
" Went before a concert. Six tables arrived at once. All were quickly seated and served. Food was very good, selection and pricing above average and good reasonable wine. We'll go again. ",5
 Excellent food served well in a comfortable setting. It has become our regular before/after Theater Dining Spot. ,4
 I have been a long time fan of Alexi's and always get the halibut with feta cheese. Fabulous signature dish! The staff is warm and welcoming (they always remember me) and the environment is cozy. I love Alexi's! ,5
 I greatly enjoyed my experience at Alexi's. It was a great atmosphere to connect with my date. I appreciated the professionalism and the courtesy provided by our waiter. I would definitely visit the restaurant again! ,4
" We eat at Alexis often because it is a pleasant atmosphere, consistently very good food, very good service, all at an exceptionally reasonable price. They even have white table cloths! Amazing! They have a bar area but we prefer the dining room. I would definitely consider Alexis for a group dinner. Also, a good place to eat before the symphony or theater downtown. ",4
 Great ambiance. Loved the fact that there wasn't loud music playing on top of the restaurant noise. My guest commented on how this was a nice place to have a conversation. ,5
" We have been going to Alexi's quite frequently for several years and have always enjoyed the great food and great service. This last visit was a bit disappointing as the service was not as good as it typically is. Although the waiter we had has waited on us many times, he did not seem to appreciate that we were there this visit. Perhaps because we had a group of 7 and the gratuity was automatically being added to the check, he did not feel he needed to provide his usual excellent service.  The food was, as always, outstanding. We will be going back, but will probably wait a little longer between visits now. ",4
 We have been going to Alexi's since our daughter took us there some time ago. There has never been a time that we did not like the food or service. I would recommend Alexi's to all. One of the few restaurants I can have a conversation without wishing I had a hearing aid. ,5
" This is a gem! Wonderful food, excellent, friendly service! In short, wonderful portion sizes of amazing Italian food served by a waitstaff who definitely want to make your meal an event and make you feel at home. ",5
 Excellent service and food. Great place to go before theatre or symphany. They will get you out on time without feeling rushed. One of our favorites! ,5
 Always great fresh appetizing food and perfectly timed professional service. Michael manages the room perfectly to ensure every guest has a phenomenal dining experience. ,5
 We enjoyed our dining experience and our server was right on top of things. We look forward to the next visit ,4
" The moment we walked in and advised that I had a reservation and the name, I was greeted and given a choice of the two tables they were holding for me, which I didn't ask them to do. We were seated right away and drinks were there before I could help my wife with her seat. The food was amazing, but more then that, the staff a is the reason we will go back. I'm more than sure he was the Manager, but Michael was awesome!!!! He was there every step of the night making sure everything was perfect. He was just the right amount of talkative and kept my wife and I engage during our visit. I could see the waiters talking and laughing with their guest, it was a very pleasant time... ",5
" best italian food ever - great service, greaqt place to being friends ",5
 Great place for dinner both for before the theatre/symphony and as a place for a leisurely dinner. Great menu choices. Great food at reasonable price. We found the house wine a great buy. Would definitely recommend it to others. ,5
 MY WIFE AND I WENT ON SATURDAY FOR THE FIRST TIME. THE HOSTESS WAS EXTREMELY FRIENDLY AND GAVE US A NICE TABLE FOR TWO WAY IN THE BACK. THE FOOD WAS VERY GOOD AND THE PRICES WERE VERY REASONABLE. THE RACK OF LAMB WAS VERY GOOD AND VERY GARLICY [AS I REQUESTED] AND MY WIFE'S TROUT ALMANDINE WAS [IN HER WORDS] EXCELLENT. WE WILL BE BACK. ,4
" Consistently great food and service, always reasonably priced. ",5
" We were seated quickly at a very nice window-side table. The bread sticks were average, we had olive oil for dipping but no balsamic. We were served someone elses salad which was whisked away and then put on someone elses table. Yikes. The spinach soup was delicious but the presentation was horrid: the most unappealing cup ever seen. The flounder was dry and the veggies were steam-table mush. It took 3 tries for the waiter to get the salad dressing right. ",1
 Overall a very good experience. ,4
" I always like eating at Alexi's Grill. I live in Peoria but we always try to go there for special events and sometimes just to have a quiet nice dinner. The food is superb and the service is exceptional. The atmosphere is perfect - white tablecloths, nobody writing their names on the tablecloths, nobody dancing, nobody singing stupid birthday wishes, no loud music, no gimmicks - just good food, good prices, good service and good atmosphere. ",5
" Thank you for a wonderful meal. We really enjoyed our entrees of spinach canneloni, pork loin and shrimp feta. Service would have been very good if our waiter didn't forget our appetizer. oops. No worries, the entree portions are plenty and very satisfying. The bar and restaurant was busy with people going/coming from theaters/shows, friends or family occasions. ",4
 Great restaurant to dine at before a night at the theater...... ,4
 The salmon special with lemon garlic sauce was superb.I also liked their salad dressing. My lunch date had the capellini pomodore and loved it. ,5
" Great place to head on special holidays. Wife and I enjoyed New Years Eve special menu with great variety and value. Try the lamb shank when available, you won't find a tastier leaner juicy presentation anywhere. ",5
" My wife and I visited Alexi's on New Year's Eve. She had the duck w/ a Grand Marnier sauce, I had the lamb shank -- and both were excellent. We had a Symphony Concert to attend afterward, and the server did a fine job of timing everything so that we got to our concert on time without having to rush. This is a consistently good dining experience, and the entire staff does a wonderful job of letting you know that you are important and that they will take care of you. Recommended. ",5
" Calamari appetizer is one of my favorites, as well as the trout almondine. The food is consistently great and never disappoints! ",5
 The lamb was outstanding!!! It unusual to find it this tender. It was a great treat and the prices are moderate. ,4
" Alexi's is a place we've passed many times on our trips to PHX. I have family in the area, and we booked there almost on a whim. Our expectations weren't high, but that turned out to be a good thing, because they wouldn't have been met otherwise. I would recommend Alexi's, but only conditionally. If you're an older couple looking to relive an experience you might have had in the 60's or 70's, this is your place. If not, you'll likely find Alexi's dated and passe. The food was decent, but the service was just OK and the menu uninspired. I don't begrudge the place it's kitschy niche, but I do wish we'd known beforehand (our fault for not researching first...) ",3
" It's the holidays so we expected it to be busy. Food is always good, and we enjoyed our lunch. Sat behind a large table of very loud women. Service was slow, but that goes with the holidays cheer. ",1
 Our waiter was fantastic! He was so attentive and accommodating. Highly recommend the restaurant for great dining at a reasonable price! ,5
 We went for a family dinner on Christmas Eve and was rewarded with an excellent meal and great service.  Would definitely return. ,5
 Food is always perfect. Service is impeccable. One of my favorite places. ,5
 First time at Alexi's Grill while in Phoenix on business. Recommended by a friend and service and food was terrific. ,5
" Our first time there. The food was excellent. Service was great. Our waiter, Tom was very kind with a good sense of humor. The manager came over to make sure everything was OK. it was very enjoyable. We will go there again and recommend it to others. ",5
" This is a nice, simple restaurant. Nothing special from what I could tell. We had never been to Alexi and were looking for a different place to go near downtown before a Saturday evening show. I had a really tasty chicken and pasta dish, while my wife had the ""special"" halibut. The special was incredibly bland and flavorless. The server said it was their signature dish, but it was only so-so. The restaurant was well lit and crowded, however the clientele seemed to be on the much older side. I was really happy with my food, but unfortunately it's unlikely I'd be able to talk my wife into going back to Alexi. ",3
" Our post-museum, pre-theater meal was an unexpected treat. Based on other reviews we opted to try Alexi's because it was near the Heard museum and not far from the Herberger for our Phoenix cultural foray. We were not disappointed. It's a perfect example of the quality of food being inversely proportional to the expense of the decor. Not hard-edge trendy, the carpeted floor and table spacing made conversation easy. We were charmed by our waiter and delighted by our meals. The Catch Veracrusano was delectable, memorable; the Salmon Genovesse grilled to perfection as were the flavorful, ripe veggies in the Vegetable Pasta; and the Roast Duck pronounced ""like butter."" We thought Alexi's an exceptional value! ",4
" I LOVE Alexi's and have dined there for years. The staff is always pleasant and, since there isn't a lot of turnover, they remember their long time and regular customers. The owner always says ""Hello"" and thanks us for coming. My very fave dish (and one of their specialities) is the halbut with feta cheese. The best! ",5
 Great value for money. Haven't had a bad meal here yet and can't beat their prices. ,5
" Just average dining here folks, looks like a local hangout.  If your looking for something creativc for dinner this is not the place.  If your hungry and downtown in Phoenix it will do.  Besides what Italian place does not have veal on the menu.  I had a rack of lamb which was a special that was good.  The wife had halibut.  Nothing notable here.  If you are looking for a place that excite the pallet this is not the place. ",3
" Most impressed with this restaurant.  It was refreshing to find an alternative to the over-priced and under-delivering Scottsdale place. Excellent atmosphere, food and service at reasonable prices for a restaurant of that level. ",5
 Alexi's is a GREAT place to eat.  Staff is very friendly and service is wonderful.  I've scheduled several business luncheons and received a good review every time.  It's really a hidden gem down town.  Prices are very reasonable for great fresh food. ,5
 The food is simply outstandingly delicious!  The service is wonderful and the prices are very reasonable!!  Look around at the  happy crowd and see if you can spot someone famous because this is definitely the in spot in downtown Phoenix.  The place is 'historic'  and memorable!! ,5
 Always exceptional service and food.  Truly one of the best Italian restaurants in Phoenix! ,5
" Alexis is our ""go to"" place in central/downtown Phoenix. The service is always friendly and prompt.  Food is consistent and reasonable for the price--$18 to 30. It isn't the best gormet and doesn't try to be. Great place to have a reasonably fast and before a downtown event. The owner, Mike, usually is there to make sure everything goes well. ",5
" We can always depend on Alexi's for excellent food, service and great care by the owners and server Thomas. Really makes an evening. ",5
" Alexi's is a terrifc downtown spot to have a delicious and efficient business lunch or an after work relaxing dinner. The food is tasty, portions are generous and it's good value for the money. Everyone is friendly and focused on customer service. ",5
" The authentic Italian experience begins when you are greeted with a smile at the door, whisked to your seat, and then regaled with excellent service and delectable dishes. ",5
" Lunch or dinner, Alexi's is always consistent;  Great food, professional waiters and impecable service.  Don't let the tablecloths and formal dressed waiters fool you, Alexi's is neighborhood friendly.  The menu items are eclectic and the daily specials are our favorites. ",5
 Specials were excellent and at a great price. We parked here then took the train to symphony hall. Avoided parking and traffic. ,5
 Been here many times over the years. The food is great (especially seafood dishes) and the service is smooth and professional. This is an intimate spot in a large office building with a big-time kitchen and staff. Highly recommended. ,5
" This year for my birthday I chose Alexi's as the place for my birthday dinner with my parents and my husband.  My husband and I have been to Alexi's many times and it is one of our favorites. We love the ambiance, the service is amazing and the food is great too.  My parents really enjoyed their first experience at Alexi's and the staff were truly wonderful in helping me to celebrate my special day.  Alexi's is a unique find in Phoenix and one that everyone should give a try. ",5
" I found it to be an ideal place for a business meal.  Good for conversation, very good food at a reasonable price.  Will go there again for sure. ",5
" Alexis is a dependable restaurant. The food is good from the salad to the fish or cannelloni. But the food is not exciting or innovative, though tasty. The waitstaff is excellent. ",4
 We were the only ones in the restaurant so it was very quiet and our food came out very fast. I had a Caesar salad with meatballs and pasta and it was very good. No complaints on the food. It was a quick lunch for me and my mentor and  I chose it because it was close to my hotel and I didn't want to go far in 105 degree Arizona dry heat. I just landed and wasn't use to it yet. ,4
" My wife and I celebrated her birthday at Alexis.  The table had linen table cloth with linen napkins and nice table ware.  We had the roasted duck which was outstanding, and the lamb chops which were very good.  The service was excellent.  Definately a fine little restaurant.  The only negative for us was the volume and selection of the background music.  A little loud for us. ",4
" This is a wonderful restaurant for a family get together.  The service was great. Food was great,  came out on time and was nicely presented. ",5
 I don't know what I would do without this mid-town staple! ,5
 Great for our lunch meeting.  Did not need to shout to be heard and food was awesome ,5
 We had a wonderful experience at Alexi's and look forward to returning there again in the near future.  The food was excellent and the service was even better. ,5
" I don't get down town all that often, but when I do, at lunchtime, Alexi's Grill is the spot I go to.  The food is always outstanding and the service is perfect.  This is a great spot for a business lunch, or just lunch with the girls.  Our waiter was fun, upbeat, yet very professional and accomodating.    We will be back!! ",5
" Alexi's is our favorite place to meet friends for lunch or dinner.   The catch of the day prepared veracruzano style is a favorite dish, but we have enjoyed anything we order.  The servers are friendly, efficient and fun. ",5
" Friendly owner, fresh quality real Italian flavor and the price is right! ",5
" My first visit here based on reviews and I was not disappointed. Good food, right portion size, quick service but not rushed!  I will return!! ",5
" Picked this restaurant on open table while on business in Phoenix.  Really wanted to find a good and nice place to take a business colleague to dinner while not spending an arm and a leg.  Good food, great service, friendly atmosphere while not being pretentious.  Very enjoyable dinner. ",4
 This is a great restaurant with wonderful food and superior service. ,5
 The flavor if the whisky peppercorn sauce on the perfectly prepared steak was wonderful. ,5
 Food was very good. Service was exceptional. Would like to see smaller cuts of beef. ,4
 A very good experience with the service and quality of food ,4
" As always, the Stockyard is an outstanding restaurant.  The atmosphere is great, the service is top notch, it's quiet considering how many people are in the restaurant, and they have many reasonable priced menu options, in addition to steaks which are excellent but a bit higher. ",5
" Great steakhouse, although a little on the expensive side.  Appreciated, though, getting discount because of our attending concert later that evening. ",4
" The food and service was great, especially the steak. The chicken was a little dry but otherwise, very good. ",5
" The food in this restaurant is excellent.    It is served hot and promptly.  The wait staff was attentive.  It is a top-notch restaurant, and a classic for the area.  The prices are a bit steep for every day dining, but are what would be expected for special occasions.  Now...it is a bit on the noisy side.  But, the corn bread and honey-butter more than make up for this!  Delicious! ",5
" Excellent service and fine food, as usual. Thanks! ",5
" My family of 5 went to the Stockyards last Sunday, Father's Day. We were celebrating Father's Day and my Aunt's 80th birthday. The ambiance of the restaurant is elegant,  but not stuffy, quiet but at the same time not. The food was wonderful, we all enjoyed our meals. The only small thing that was ""wrong"" was the selection of bread. Usually there are 3-4 different breads on the table that night there was only 2. As I said not a huge issue just something we noticed. ",5
" The customer service was great at this restaurant.  We went on Father's Day for dinner, and were seated right away, with our reservation, and received very good customer service.  The food was good, my son had the filet mignon, which I think tasted better than the breaded veal I chose.  We would return to this restaurant. ",5
" From the moment we walked in, everyone couldn't have been more friendly. The staff is amazing. Food was great too. Beef dishes are the way to go. And everyone, order the Parmesan potatoes!! Yummy! ",5
" Was a great experience for the most part. While they do have high chairs for little ones, they do not provide adequate cups with lids for kids. Food was great! Service was stellar. ",4
 Delicious food in a cozy atmosphere. Great historical feeling. ,5
 Always excellent. Very comfortable seating and top service. ,5
" Since my first visit in 1959, the Stockyards Restaurant has had a consistent high level.  Over the years, when in Phoenix, I have taken numerous business associates to dinner and always had a good experience. ",4
" We normally love the Stockyards and have there a number of times. This time the food was a little of the service felt forced. My filet Oscar was mushy, the desert present fun but it was bland boring. My after  port was to sharp. I am hoping it was an off night but it did put a damper on our anniversary dinner. ",3
 Our meal was wonderful combined with impeccable service. ,5
" We had a wonderful overall experience, food was phenomenal and service was excellent! Really great historic restaurant with beautiful nostalgic pieces throughout the building! I'm in love with this place! ",5
" Thank you to Dan from south bend , our wonderful server, and everyone who made this such a fun night. The food was delicious, we loved the decor, and the service was great. If we are ever in Phoenix again we will definitely return. Highly recommend. ",5
" My wife and I met two friends of mine I have known for 45 years, and our entire meal was excellent. Our server was knowledgeable and personable, with a quick sense of humor. The wine choice was a perfect accompaniment to our steaks, and our experience was 5 stars all around ",5
" I was surprised at the location. It was a very nice location, but it was also interesting.  The food was great, the shrimp cocktail was good and spicy.  The appetizer was good, the steak was tender, and the desert was the best. We enjoyed the meal and we were happy that they were participating in restaurant week. The service was seamless and wonderful also. ",5
 Pecan pie was phenomenal!! Great service and definitely a unique cowboy style restaurant! Great place for a good steak! ,5
" Went during AZ Restaurant Week and we were pleasantly surprised. It is a neat old building with lots of nostalgia and was fun to walk around reading the various photos on the wall and learn history that I never knew before and we've lived here a very long time.  The food is good starting with delicious corn bread and biscuits that came with honey butter, yummy. They also give you a relish tray with carrots, zucchini, celery and black olives. We stuck with the restaurant week menu which was well worth $44.00/person. My husband had the chili and really liked it and i had the steak soup delicious packed with lots of meat. We both had the 16oz. prime rib medium rare which was tender and cooked to perfection with a very good au jus (not salty). We both took 1/2 home and ate it for lunch the next day (still great the next day). Since a mild horseradish sauce comes with the meal my husband requested the real horseradish and our server promptly brought it to him. We also had the whiskey sweet potato mash; it makes you feel like its the holidays, sweet with a hint of cinnamon and cloves,excellent. We both had the pecan pie for dessert, lots of nuts and delicious, especially with bourbon whipped cream. Service is good, our waitress was very bubbly. We probably will return but if it isn't restaurant week it is pricey and it just doesn't have the upscale feel that other steak houses in the valley have at that price level. ",4
" Great atmosphere, wait staff was very attentive. Food was very tasty and filling. Really liked the booth seating very comfortable. Lots of history, if you like that sort of thing. ",5
" We had heard great things about The Stockyards restaurant and decided to try it out.  We went on a Thursday night during ""restaurant week"" and was able to take advantage of a 3 course meal for $44.00.  My wife and I stated out with the house salad with fresh homemade dressing.  My wife had the filet and it was like butter, so much flavor she said.  I had the prime rib and it had to be the best prime rib I have ever tasted.  We then enjoyed the chocolate cake for dessert with coffee.  Stockyards is noted for their beef and by all means if you have never eaten there, you must try it at least once. Service was very good as well, we were seated as soon as we arrived, plates were removed right away and our glasses were always filled. ",5
 Outstanding work by the waiter and crew. The food was absolutely awesome. The waiter was very informative concerning the menu. 5 stars across the board. ,5
 Martinis were watered down and the Ribeye tasted like it was cooked on a flat top.  At least the service was good. There are way better steak houses at this price point and lower. ,2
 Service was great - server knowledgeable about the food. Food - less than memorable. ,3
 Menu and setting capture part of Phoenix's past that has largely disappeared. The soups were superb and the the mammoth prime rib was one of the best in the valley. We had a thoroughly enjoyable evening. ,5
 Service was good and the food was excellent  we would return ,5
" My wife and I celebrated our 33rd wedding Anniversary at the Stockyards last Saturday. We have always wanted to 'try' this restaurant and have never been able to get it on the calendar so this year I asked the wife about going there for dinner and she lit up right away and said yes! Wow! The food, the service, and the experience made our evening that much more special and we will definitely be back again. My wife had the filet and when she ordered it well done I thought, oops...that's normally a not so done cut of meat. It arrived at the table and it was excellent as was my prime rib. Like I said Great food at a fair price. Our server(s) were excellent as well and always attentive to whatever we needed.Looking forward to the next time.  K and C ",5
" Food was great, just what I expected from a high quality food establishment. ",4
 One of my favorites!! Fantastic food and service!  Always!! ,5
" You can never go wrong with the Stockyards. Good food, good ambiance and convenient. ",4
 Excellent food. The steaks were cooked perfectly. The restaurant is pricey but well worth it! ,5
 Great unique Phoenix restaurant when we are losing so many one-of-a-kind places.  Service was excellent - attentive without being hovering.  Food outstanding.  Obviously no microwaves on premises!!  Ease of making reservations.  Highly recommended. ,5
 Always a fantastic time ,5
" Whenever we have some little reason to celebrate, everyone votes for Alexi's.  Food and service is always great, and it's practically around the corner.  What's not to like? ",5
" My wife and I elected that afternoon to have Italian food; rather than going to The Spaghetti Factory on Central Avenue in Phoenix, we decided we wanted to try a restaurant unknown to us. Open Table pointed out Alexi's Grill nearby. With a 2:45p appointment, we were the only guests at the time in the restaurant. Service was initially slow but we come to find the waiter was doing an errand run and the hostess was not aware at the time.  (Hey, things happen). Once that was known by the hostess, we received very nice attentive service. The food was served hot and was very good. The atmosphere was very nice within, nicely furnished with a small water pond in front along with an outdoor patio area.  Even with two glasses of wine, the bill was still quite reasonable. We would not hesitate to return in the future. Thank you. ",4
 Who puts butter in Eggplant parmigiano? Who puts butter in spinach sauteed in olive oil-when specifically asked for no butter?  Our waiter thought he was all that and then some.  I won't be back. ,2
" We have been going to Alexis for 20 years. And it is always the same--good food at a reasonable price in a relaxing atmosphere. the owner, Mike, is there to make sure everything is to your satisfaction. Great choice before a downtown Phoenix event. ",5
 why do I need to write a review ever y time I use Open  Table? ,4
 I am picky with Italian food because I live my own Italian! This was Italian with a twist! Really good and reasonable! Decor is light but really a treat for a cozy dinner. ,5
 I've had lunch and dinner at Alexi's  Grill and the food was delicious and affordable.  The portions are very large and the service is outstanding. ,4
" Alexis provides good food, excellent fish, and pleasant service with great consistency.  And, you cannot beat the prices. ",4
" I have long loved Alexi's. It is one of my favorite special event (i.e.) birthday venues. It never disappoints. The food is wonderful (I love the halibut with feta cheese and chocolate mousse), the staff is friendly and attentive (they always remember and thank you) and it's cozy and intimate. ",5
" If you are looking for an upscale meeting place for a business lunch, this is the place!  The food, service and location are ideal.  Equally important, the staff makes all guests feel special and the restaurant is not loud, allowing for a great conversation without struggling to hear. ",5
 This was our 5th visit. We found it on Open Table late last year and it is a great place before a play or show in the downtown area. Great special menue for Valentines Day. Great food and service. ,4
" What a great find - food, service and value were superb.  The staff are friendly and great conversation.  The bruschetta is a must - it's on the bar menu, so ask for it in the restaurant!  Well worth it and we'll be back in numbers! ",5
 Long time excellent Italian restaurant. They deserve their well-earned reputation. ,4
" Excellent NY Strip Steak, if you are craving a good steak, this is the place. ",5
 The steaks at The Stockyards never disappoint and the pear salad as a starter is a treat for the palate.  The service is always just right in terms of attentiveness without being intrusive.  Everyone from the wait-staff to the server/expediters and bussers are friendly and make you feel appreciated. ,5
 Alexi's is always a winner. The service is really good and the food is excellent! Everyone is always pleased with their meal. ,4
 Was referred to the restaurant by a friend who had been a regular several years ago.  I went there for a business lunch and was pleasantly surprised at the quality and affordability of the place.  I had the chicken piccata which was outstanding.  The chicken was perfectly prepared and moist while the lemon caper sauce had the perfect balance.  I will be returning again very soon! ,5
 We frequently go to Alexis for lunch.  It is always a great experience. ,5
 This was probably the best place I've had Prom dinner at compared to the other 3 proms I've been too.  Excellent choice and fantastic service all around. ,5
" Alexi's is one of my favorite places to dine. The salmon is wonderful.  It melts in your mouth.  The wine selection  is vast. The owner,   Michael, always welcomes us.  Yes, I would recommend this place to everyone because it's that GREAT! ",5
" Alexi's is outstanding. The atmosphere, service, and food are always dependable and delicious. ",5
 We have been to Alexis many times and have NEVER had anything but an outstanding experience! Food - Prices- Wait Staff - Everything was wonderful ,5
" Maybe we have just gotten used to really good Italian but Alexi's was just mediocre.  Standard, non-inventive menu, but that was ok.  But pasta was overcooked, sauces lacked zip and chicken in the parmesan was ok but would have been better if were pounded... ",3
" Delicious food, friendly atmosphere and great service!  It's a neighbor gem! ",5
 Alexi's is one of our favorite places to dine. We have tried almost everything on the menu and have never been disappointed ,5
 A wonderful dining experience. Have been there many times and each time we have been more than satisfied. ,5
" Had a great experience here. The food was great, and the waitstaff very helpful and friendly. The location was great, very close to the theatre we were headed to afterwards. We will be back. ",5
 We've been to Alexi's several times and the food is always delicious! ,5
 I am a long time customer of Alexi's and love it! The food is great and the service outstanding. It has always been a special place-one of my favorites. ,5
" Have eaten here many times with groups in the evening.  The food is consistently excellent, especially like their seafood.  Service is always good.  Many times the waiters are so funny and friendly.  They make it a nice experience.  They have a really nice outdoor patio with a covering.  It is close to a little water fountain where there are flowers and herbs (grown for their use).  Very convenient for those using the light rail.  Good central location for work groups who live in different parts of the valley.  I don't think many people know about this place.  It is a hidden gem. ",5
 Took some out of town guests for lunch. Staff is always attentive and food was tasty. ,4
" We have been to Alexis many times. Just when I think they cannot top themselves, they do. Food is wonderful. Soup or salad is included with your meal, which is a bit unusual in this day and age. We went for dinner with friends before the theater. We mentioned to our waiter that we had to leave by 7. He timed everything so that we were not rushed (even had time for coffee and dessert) and were able to arrive at the theater in plenty of time. ",5
 Excellent food and value but slow food service. Attentive and knowledgeable server but slow service from kitchen (over 50 minutes until arriving at table) rushed our dinner before an evening event of which the restaurant had been made aware in advance. ,4
" What I appreciate most about this great restaurant is no female wait staff. Men are not petty...are more patient, look more professional than the typical female staff. They know the menu. Men just do their job. Having a well groomed, attractive hostess to great is good...but when it comes to getting down to business serving customers...Men always. ",4
 We have dined at Alexi's many times and have consistently had excellent service and food that is outstanding!!!  The staff are all friendly and professional and the manager greets everyone and makes them feel welcome and appreciated. ,5
" We've met friends for dinner at Alexi's before theater/ballet/opera now 3 times and just love the convenience.  We both drive and meet at Alexi's for dinner and then take 1 car downtown to whatever venue we have planned.  Afterwards we drive back to Alexi's to drop off the other couple and pick up the car we left.  It's so convenient!  We're even considering picking up the light rail next time and avoiding the parking hassle altogether.  And, what makes it all worthwhile is the food, service and prices are excellent; in particular, the ""specials"" list which is always changing and extensive.  We love this restaurant! ",5
 The lobster raviolis ,5
" We have been going to Alexi's for the past five Years.. Taking friends... Special ocassions, and... Well....just because...  EVERYTIME... Has been the same..... GREAT ",5
" We had a reservation and were seated promptly, but right in front of the kitchen. Two people with no reservation were seated 10 minutes later by a window away from the bustle. We were in the process of sitting when the waiter ran over and asked what we wanted to drink. We were literally still standing and he had no wine list or anything else. The waiter rushed all night and gave us scant attention. The food was pedestrian but at least it was prices correctly. We asked for our food to be boxed up and found out when we went to eat it for lunch today that they had boxed someone else's food. The entire evening was rushed and haphazard and a huge disappointment for a Valentine dinner. ",2
 We have dined at Alexi's many times and each time the food and the service are spectacular!!  I highly recommend it!!! ,5
" Had reservation on  Saturday night at 5:30, still a wait to get our food, which was excellent. Noise is what I don't like. If someone would open and advertise a 'quiet restaurant,' I'd be there and bring everybody I know. Lots of us dislike all the noise. ",4
" Charming, elegant, a little gem among this business district of downtown Phoenix.  The service was outstanding as well as the food. ",5
 We dined on Wednesday night and told the waiter that we had theater and needed to order promptly. We arrived at 5:15 and were seated promptly.  The waiter assured us we would be out in plenty of time.  It took 45 minutes from the time we ordered to get our dinners leaving us to rush thru our meal.  I would expect the waiter to let us know if our choices would take too much time or we just had bad luck.  the food was good but dinner was not enjoyable.  It was my first time at Alexis and I won't be returning soon. ,4
 Have been to Alexis many times and have never had a bad experience. The food is terrific. You have a choice of soup or salad with your entrée. The prices are more than reasonable. It is just a wonderful place to have a relaxing dinner. ,5
 waiter very difficult to understand-He mumbled. Food was served very quickly. Waiter tried to remove my plate three times while the dinner food was still on the plate.  He finally listened the third time I asked him not to remove my plate of food.  Very annoying. ,3
 This is a great place to eat. All the food is excellent and well prepared. It tastes like homemade. The pricing is very reasonable and every meal gets a salad. I wish I had a restaurant like this in my home town because I would frequent it often. If you are in Phoenix you have to go to this restaurant. The food and service it outstanding. It offers a great variety as well. ,5
" Great menu selections, nice atmosphere and excellent knowledgeable wait staff.  Great place to go before a show in downtown Phoenx.  Delicious duck, lamp chops and salmon. ",5
 Great food.  Awesome staff.  Now if they could just get some drinkable wines I'd be in heaven.  The shrimp or catch of the day Fra Diavolo is the best I've ever had!  Very spicy. ,5
" went to Alexi's for pre-theater dinner before a show at Phoenix Theater.  close proximity to Phoenix Theater so made it very convenient.  the atmosphere was very nice.  Service staff was excellent, and the food was delicious.  will definitely return. ",4
" This was a first time lunch with friends at this site and the four of us were very pleased with the service, food was succulent, requested seating with a view and it was accommodated and there was high energy.  We already recommended Alexi's to another couple and look forward to returning. ",4
" Very good, especially for the price.  Good happy hour drinks and snacks. ",4
 There was a large party going on while I was there but the wait staff did there best to take care of us. ,4
" The restaurant is lovely with tables spaced far enough apart that you can carry on a conversation easily. The food was delicious. The service was even better. I asked for my meal to be gluten-free, and the server delivered my request to the chef.  The chef prepared a special sauce for my duck which was gluten-free and wonderfully tasty. Our server was a seasoned professional who was friendly as well as efficient.  We have driven past this restaurant for years and are kicking ourselves for not trying it sooner.  It is definitely on our list of favorites now. ",5
 Welcoming staff ,5
" Everyone in our group of nine enjoyed the food, the atmosphere and the service. Some time ago I took my ten year old twin granddaughters to Alexi's Grill and they loved it and continue to ask me when I am going to take them there again. ",5
" Very good food, service and a great place for a business lunch. ",5
" Alexi's is one of our favorite restaurants, and we return regularly. We have never been disappointed in our menu choices. We highly recommend it. ",5
" We've always counted on Alexi's for great food and service at reasonable prices. On our last visit, however, we discovered that the food and service aren't so great when the restaurant is extremely busy. If you have to go at peak hours, I suggest ordering one of the specials and making absolutely no changes to it. (A request to substitute french fries for pasta brought us twice-fried fries, leathery and dark brown.) The one person in our party who did that was as pleased with his dinner as we all are accustomed to being at this well-regarded restaurant. ",3
" We went to Alexi's for my daughter's birthday. I had the vodka tortellini, which was very good. I would have liked it to have more of a kick (it had an alfredo jalapeno sauce), but that's just personal preference. Other entrees at the table included chicken parmigiana and fettucini alfredo. We all enjoyed our meals and the portions were generous.  The tables were very close together, so there was no privacy. It felt like we were dining with the people at the neighboring tables.  The service was decent, but when we emptied our water glasses, we had to wait for them to be refilled.  I wouldn't recommend Alexi's for a special occasion, but I'm sure they're great for lunch. ",3
" Our service was wonderful, waiter was very attentive. Food was great aside of my comment below. Inside decor is in need of an update though. It's time to get 'with the times.' ",5
" We went to Alexis before going to the Phoenix Symphony. Both Alexis and Christo's, her sister restaurant, are our ""go to"" restaurants for delicious, reliable dinners in Central Phoenix. Both are always busy, so I recommend making reservations. Service is always very good, food is always very good and pricing is very reasonable. We love the white tablecloths and the quiet ambiance. We can actually have a conversation while dining here! ",4
 Absolutely outstanding.... I brought two couples who had never been there. They both want to go back immediately!!!! Everyone in group loved Alexi's. ,5
" Great location, delicious, well seasoned food served at the perfect temperature, and a friendly professional staff of waiters, bartenders, bussers, and management. If you don't try this one, you're missing a real treat! ",5
 Went for NYE dinner. The food was ok but far from exceptional and the service was poor. The waiter forgot one course of our meal and seemed annoyed rather then apologetic when we asked about it. ,3
" We had our New year's Eve dinner here. There was a special N.Y.E. menu, so we didn't get to dine on their regular menu items. the food was superb, the service a little rushed. An excellent place to dine before attending an evening function or event in downtown. Easy parking in their own lot. ",4
 Alexi's is an established Phoenix favorite that deserves its great reputation - the service is excellent as is the food and the welcome. It is special. ,5
" We have our annual work holiday lunch here and everyone is always very pleased. The food is tremendous and the service is top-notch. Even though the atmosphere is elegant and the food is gourmet, the prices are reasonable. Can't wait to visit for a romantic dinner. ",5
 Alexi's is in a good location with convenient parking. The food is always good and they offer a number of daily specials. I rarely look at the menu as we almost always get one of them. ,5
" Excellent veal chop, pasta, and appetizers. Reasonably-priced wine list. Super service. We'll be back. ",5
" Great location for a downtown business lunch or special occasion. The service is always top notch, as is the food. ",5
" Very good food and service. A quiet, neighborhood feel, I would definitely recoend it. ",4
" Food was outstanding. I had red snapper fra diavolo, my wife had shrimp scampi. We went after a visit to the Desert Botanical Garden, and we couldn't have topped off a great day any better. Our waiter, Thomas, was friendly and helpful, and made my birthday dinner a very special event. ",5
" I LOVE Alexi's and have been a customer for years. My absolute fave dish is the halibut topped with tomato and feta cheese. The service is great and I like the mellow, low key vibe. The only issue is that it can be a bit noisy at lunch time. ",5
" Aaaahhh, another great meal at Alexi's. Veal chop, mussels, sirloin pasta, bottle of wine. There was a large group (30 or so) in the back, but the food and service didn't falter a bit. Adjacent to the light rail and handy for the north-downtown office crowd. ",5
 Excellent service and food as always. ,5
" Alexi's Grill is a white table cloth restaurant. The food is excellent. The lunch menu is reasonably priced for the quality of food, service and ambiance. I recommend this restaurant for a business lunch, gathering of friends, and definetly a romantic occasion. They do have a quaint bar area as well, however I have not had the pleasure of participating in their happy hour. Enjoy their menu, you will be pleasantly surprised at both the quality of food and prices. Oh yes the service is very good too. ",5
 First time to dine @ this restaurant &amp; my party loved the food! ,4
" Excellent food and service! The lunch prices are very reasonable, this is one of my favorite places to go during business lunch. ",5
" One of the most consistently good restaurants in the Central Cooridor. Great value, too. ",5
" I have been a fan of Alexi's for awhile now. Their specials are always great (featuring rack of lamb, Alaskan halibut and roast duck my last tiem there) and while the quality of food is great, they don't charge the high prices you expect to find with food of this quality. I definitely hope more people discover Alexi's as, unfortunately, it was almost barren on Sat. night when I went there. ",4
 Excellent food and service. Classy place. ,5
" With very tastefully decorated indoor and outdoor dining, and a very nice menu, I would have expected it to be more expensive that it was. ",5
 It took repeated requests and over 20 minutes to get sweetner for the iced tea. Otherwise it was a wonderful evening. ,4
" Outstanding food &amp; service, as always. You can't go wrong with their veal chop or the Chardonnay mussels. Great pastas, too. Handy for the office lunch crowd. I do wish, however, that they'd get some of the pedestrian plonk off their wine list and put on a few of the lesser-known gems. If done right, it won't move their pricing structure much. ",5
" Food was great, large portions, good service. ",4
" Alexi's never disappoints us. This trip we tried two specials: bowtie pasta with mixed seafood for my date, swordfish in a lemon-cilantro sauce for me. Both were excellent. Swordfish has a tendency to be dry, but this rendition was moist and delicious. Tasty appetizers and desserts, combined with top-notch service, rounded out the evening. The only puzzler: where was everybody? At no point in the evening was the place more than one-quarter full. ",5
" We had a wonderfully relaxing dinner after work. The service was timely yet never a rush. I had the lamb, best ever! ",5
 Always the best fish and the duck was FAB ,1
" The server we had was terrible, made it obvious she didn't want to be there. The food was a far stretch on creativity with the southwest twist on Italian; the flavors did not pair together well at all. The one bright spot was the classic Calamari which was very good. ",2
" The food was ok here; however, the chef overcooked the pasta. This is an ok lunch spot with a decent menu; however, the food preparation could have been better. ",2
" Fabulous food, as always, and great service. Great for a pre-event meal, as parking is easy and free and service is responsive to your timetable. The Halibut Athena is always the best choice. ",5
" Our experience was tremendous. The wait staff was attentive yet not obtrusive. The food was superb. I had the bone in veal chop that was simply outstanding, my wife had the halibut which was prepared perfectly, the accompanying vegetables and pasta's were excellent, crisp, clean and plentiful. Our friends had three appetizer plates that split between them and they raved about the calamari and the mussels. The steak salad looked absolutely extraordinary. We all agreed a great place, excellent food, and wonderful for theater, shows or events downtown. ",5
" Very convenient for a business lunch, happy hour, or dinner with a client. Great food (try the veal chop at dinner). Terrific service. ",5
 Simply scrumptious and the service/management is perfect in every way. I would recommend this restaurant to everyone! ,5
" The lamb was marvelous, and the halibut outstanding. The wine list had enough variety for me to easily pair my meal. And the spumoni was excellent. Will definitely return in the future when in the area. ",5
 Good food at a reasonable price. Good for pre-theatre in Phoenix. ,3
" Food was very well-prepared, but the selection was too heavy for summer in Phoenix (or anywhere). For some reason all of the menu items still feature winter vegetables, which brought the whole experience down a peg. This is Phoenix. We wear sandals and white before Memorial Day, and nobody is hankering for winter squash when it's over 100 degrees out. Also, there literally was almost nothing on the menu that my vegetarian friend could order that didn't require her to pick around meat . . . so updating is needed in that sense as well. Staff at TOR (and actually everywhere throughout the resort) are just amazing. Whoever is training and managing staff around there definitely knows what they are doing. I LOVE GOOD SERVICE!! Keep it up!! ",3
" Good wine selection, good draft beer selected (four lakes brews), but everything was overpriced. Good for a one time find/special occasion, but I would not go back unless someone else is buying. ",3
" 10th wedding anniversary, Excellent evening and the ""team"" TOR was a big influence. You can ask for more, but you would be being greedy. Very good value for the overall experience. ",4
 The view was great and our server was friendly ,4
" Our server was slow, we had to ask for things 2or3 times. We actually had to ask for bread twice. Just not the quality of service we have experienced before. The vegetables were over cooked. The crab salad was excellent and the server made sure that my salmon was unsalted , I appreciated that service. ",4
" Pros:the food was good and we walked away from the table well satisfied.  Cons: it wasn't as classy a place as we'd expected. The background (soft rock) music was louder than necessary and the waiter tried a bit too hard.  Overall: we'd go back again when next we're in Phoenix, but this time with expectations suitably adjusted. The food was good, the rice was reasonable and the view over the valley also added to the ambience. ",3
 Enjoyed the food and scenery. Going to go back again. I've driven by the place a hundred times and have never been in there until now. Loved it. ,5
 We loved the experience and our waitress was so helpful. I thought she was in college and she told me that she is 37 years old with 3 children. We are from Southern Illinois and the recommendation came from my Doctor who visited the area earlier. We will do the same for friends headed to the Tempe area. ,5
" Haven't been here in years but was looking forward to coming back. Brought some work colleagues from outside the US to enjoy the spectacular view and AZ sunset. The Open Table reservation worked great; we were greeted by name and given a perfect table to enjoy the view.  Unfortunately, that was the highlight of the evening. The drinks, appetizer, meal and dessert were acceptable, but not what I expected for The Buttes nor for a Marriott resort. Overpriced and very disappointing. ",2
 We traveled in from So.CA for a weekend get-away. Once upon a time this was a faublous restaurant. Not any longer. We made a request when we made the reservation that this was a special occasion. It was not acknowledged. We were seated next to the servers station which was very distracting and noisy. The hostess and servers were extremely inexperienced. Table service was very poor for a $100 meal. The on-line menu was not current with the restaurant and several items were not available. The menu selection was not in keeping with a restaurant of this type with the spectacular location and scenic view. 15-20 years ago this was the talk of the town. I wouldn't even bring it up in conversation now except to turn people away. ,2
 Outstanding view of the city. Food is luscious. ,5
" I read that this was a good restaurant for special occasions. It was my fiancé's birthday and I wanted to do something special. The restaurant advertised that for special occasions they offer ""free bubbly,"" so I made a note in my reservation. Upon arrival the hostess confirmed that it was a special occasion and that she had planned a nice window seat but that we had to wait because it wasn't ready. 15 minutes later we were seated. The server was very nice and there when we needed him. The food was good, nothing exceptional, but definitely good. The view was amazing and I did not regret waiting for the table. It seemed the hostess did not relay the information about our special occasion because they did absolutely nothing. ",3
" It was my boyfriend's birthday so I wanted something extra special! I went on to Open Table and for Top of the Rock there was free bubbly for a special occasion. So I made the reservation put ""free Bubbly"" in the comment section. When we arrived they made note of the special occasion, brought us over immediately the ""bubbly"" and we had great food, we ordered the ""Mac"" to start...YUMMY!! He ordered steak and I had the scallops! When we were done our waiter offered us dessert on the house to make the celebration extra special! My boyfriend was so impressed and I was thrilled the evening turned out so special! ",5
 Food was great and the service was great. Had a great waitress. ,5
 Had a very good dinner. Beautiful views from above the city. ,4
" What an amazing view!  This was a spectacular meal mostly due to the amazing view from the restaurant.  This is a must for out of town visitors.  The food is very good and the service was very good, as well. ",4
" Excellent appetizers and main courses. I personally had the crab salad and the sea bass that both exceeded my expectation. Cooking was just right and the sauce and seasonning were very tasteful. On the other hand desserts did not impress us, maybe it would be à good idea to hire à good pastry chef. We are still wondering why it was so difficult to make the reservation; when we called we were told that is was full, on Open Table only one spot at 8:45pm was available (this is how we got our table for 2) and when we arrived at 8:30 the restaurant was almost empty. Weird ",4
 The portions are a little too small! Unlike most outstanding restaurants they have no bisque! Do not attempt to substitute a food item you will get neither the item nor the sub. If you do not like bread with olives then walk with your own! ,4
" This is a restaurant with awesome views! It was too cold to sit outside but even watching the sunset from inside with its huge windows was great. The drawback is the menu. It is very limited and definitely not upscale. My scallops were cooked perfectly; however, my husband's steak was mediocre. We tried the bread pudding and it was dry and crusty. Their wine list does not include vintages so you must ask the server to check on the individual bottles. It is a shame that this beautiful location does not live up to the expectations of other ""view"" restaurants in the Phoenix area such as Different Point of View. ",3
 Our waitress was wonderful. It wasn't busy so it was not loud. It is a very nice place. ,5
" Excellent overall, very romantic for special times. Our server was Outstanding! ",4
" The Dinosaur Pot Roast was a big hit! Other choices within our party of five included the Buttermilk Fried Chicken (delicious), Bacon Mac and Cheese (very tasty) and a huge Filet Mignon (cooked medium to perfection). We all left very happy about this meal!  I've been here for happy hour, family dinners and now I need to try a holiday buffet. See you again in 2013. ",5
" We had an exceptional 10th Anniversary meal! Joshua, our server, started us out with complimentary champagne, in honor of our celebration. My wife started with the house salad, with a delicious house made dressing. I had the Maryland Crab salad, with HUGE chunks of crab (how they can sell this at $13 is beyond my understanding). My wife had a oversized, perfectly cooked rib-eye with bleu cheese topping, while I had the black bass over puréed eggplant. I almost never eat the skin, but this was succulently crisp and so tasty I couldn't resist. Joshua again comped us dessert for our 10th, a delicious bread pudding with caramel.  Great city views, quiet, courteous and impeccable service. What a great night! ",5
" It's been years since I was last at top of the rock. In my mind it was romantic, ""fancy"" and a great experience. I convinced my husband to go try it out. We walked in and It looked like it has not been updated since I went 20 years ago. We decided to have a cocktail outside before dinner. There was no ambiance- no music, no space heaters (it was getting cold) and the view was of the highway. There was no view of the gorgeous sunset. We had to look through the windows.we decided to order a cheese and charcuterie plate as an appetizer. Nothing exciting here. 3 cheeses that all looked the same- same textures, all smoked. Boring..... We decided to cut our losses and left after apps and drinks ",1
" absolutely amazing!! Everything was perfect! The food, the view and the service. I recommend anyone in the Phoenix area to stop here! ",5
" Great view and okay everything else. We probably hit it on a bad night in that the soda machine wasn't working well, some of our food wasn't cooked quite as specified, we had some noisy groups nearby, and it took awhile to track our server down a couple of times. Thus the ""good"" rating, but I'd say it had the potential to be very good. ",3
" Wonderful experience! Food is outstanding. View of the city and mountains is amazing. Very good for special occasions such as anniversary, birthday, engagement, etc. The wait staff were tentative and knowledgeable. They also have happy hour from 5-7p that was lively and good deals on food and drink. It can be a little noisy during happy hour as is held at the front of the restaurant so if you want it more intimate request a table near the windows overlooking the city or dine after happy hour. No complaints-this is a wonderful find. Would highly recommend ",5
" The service was excellent, our server was attentive and efficient with out being intrusive, very knowlegable, and pleasant. The food was amazing and every course was excelllent and well presented. The citrus salad with a jalapeno vinagrette dressing was amazing. We had pan seared scallops with a corn rissoto that was out of this world. The scallops were cooked to perfection. Crab stuffed steak was delicious and the meat was cooked perfect to order.  Dessert was incredible, I don't have room to go into it but I have to say, I've never had Flan before and it is now my favorite dessert.  I could go on and on, great restaurant, atmosphere was excellent . Ernesto Moreno and the guys in the kitchen were excellent. ",5
" The view, service and food was fantastic. Enjoyed my birthday dinner there very much. ",5
" The food was good, but not great for the price. What is great about this place is the VIEW. The thin to do is sit outside and watch the Arizona night sky while having a glass of wine with friends or someone special. It is worth the trip for that alone. The food isn't bad, it's just not great. ",3
" One night for Date Night we dined at the Top of the Rock Restaurant in Tempe. Valet service was available and the restaurant was easy to locate and access. We were promptly greeted by the two ladies at the hostess station and seated immediately at our reserved table. I ordered the Habitat for Humanity 3-course special (Wedge Salad, Surf and Turf, and Apple Cheesecake) which was absolutely wonderful. My boyfriend got the Roasted Chicken with Chorizo Whipped Potatoes, which he found to be OK (but he is a VERY picky eater). The presentation of our dishes was fabulous and our service even better. We spent several hours dinning with a beautiful view of the city. I can’t wait to visit this establishment again. ",4
" Can't believe it has taken me so long to eat here. Came for my bday dinner and was blown away with the service, food and obviously the view. I recommend getting there early enough to watch the sun set and definitely grab a patio table. ",5
" This was an awesome find! I live less than 7 minutes from Top of the Rock. I can't believe that it took me 8 years to actually try it out. The views are amazing. You can see downtown Phoenix, Camelback Mountain, and watch the airplanes lining up in the sky for the airport. The every day happy hour is great for locals to have a chance to come more often. My only suggestion would be to dim the overhead outside lighting. For the quests that are sitting under the lights, it tends to shine right in their face. If there was a way to put those lights on a dimmer, it would be an easy fix. Otherwise, everything made for a wonderful experience. Staff was beyond outstanding, drinks and food were unique and delicious. ",4
 Awesome views of the city from this place. ,5
" From the drinks on the patio to the cozy table with an amazing panoramic view of the east valley for dinner, our total dining experience was more than outstanding. The serving staff were courteous and friendly as well as observant. Every course--from the sliced duck in the appetizer, to the locally made bread, pan seared grouper, tender scallop, melt-in-your mouth beef filet,and an excellent Cabernet--was artfully plated and absolutely delicious. We appreciated that the restaurant manager and the chef paid a visit to our table. We highly recommend the Top of the Rock as an A+ dining experience! ",5
 My wife and I went there for our anniversary. We both agreed that it was one of the best restaurant experiences we have ever had. We had a 6 course meal and every bite was mouth watering. ,5
" We mentioned in our reservation that we would be spending our anniversary with them (we are both Marriott employees in CA)and only the hostess acknowledged it. It was very disappointing that we spent $125 on service that was not guanine and came off very causal. Our server had food in his teeth and told a few bad jokes. Our salad was over dressed, the ceviche was bland, and my husband sent back his 10 hour braised pork shoulder because he could hardly cut through it! Our dessert didn’t come on a dessert plate or complimentary. It’s the little things that go a long way. We feel ripped off and are trying to put this experience out of our minds. ",1
" I am mixed on this one. It's a beautiful place with great views of the city. If you go, go at a time you can sit on the patio. Food was tasty, but missed in a few areas (extra gritty scallops, overcooked filet even after second visit to the table to verify that my wife wanted medium rare and to describe what they consider medium rare). Service was ok, though I thought it was notable that neither the server or manager ever asked how our food was. We left saying we probably wouldn't return and yet if the service and food had been just a little better or the prices lower... They are on the verge of being something really great or just another self-important joint. ",3
 Couldn't have been a better experience. Top of the Rock is top of the industry. ,5
" One of my favorite restaurants. Matt at the bar knows my name and what I like for lunch. I always order the fish special, which is fresh, tasty and comes in a short amount of time which fits my lunch schedule. I get the salmon, simply grilled, it is moist and flavorful. ",4
" When I set up a time meet people for a business lunch, I always pick Alexis grill.  Good food, good service and good price. ",5
" This is a great place to dine. The owner and staff make you feel very welcomed and appreciated. The pasta was very fresh and tasty. There was plenty of bread and wonderful coffee. (Not cold, old or watered down) Would recommended it to locals and tourist. ",5
" We go to Alexi's because of its wide variety of fish dishes. The food and service are consistently excellent, and we appreciate the friendly owner and helpful staff. ",5
" Our party of 5 came here for a special dinner. We were seated promptly as we arrived. We had requested a private area so we could talk freely. They seated us in an area that was just as we asked. Thomas, our server, did not rush us. He provided us with menus and a wine list and answered any questions we might have had. Thomas was excellent. There when you needed him and not hovering. He never questioned the occasion for the dinner until handing the check which was very nice. This was a very personal meeting of close friends and all had a wonderful time.  ",5
 I have been there at least a dozen tomes and have never been disappointed by the food or the service. ,5
" This place continues to be a bright spot on Central Avenue, with really good dishes and exceptional service. Easy parking too. ",5
" Established restaurant, with staff that has been there almost since the beginning (a very good omen.) Interior is dated; could use some refreshing. Nothing daring or imaginative on the menu, but at least you know what you are getting. Rack of lamb special would have been better without a lemon-garlic sauce, perhaps blended spices??? But prepared to medium and very tender (albeit mine were a bit fatty). Bone-in veal chop was huge, served with same lemon-garlic sauce, cooked perfectly and extremely tender. Both entrees served with carrots, broccoli &amp; baby potatoes (very unimaginative). Service was attentive. We didn't feel rushed at all. Lots of locals and repeat customers (another good omen.)  ",4
" My first visit (but not my last) to Alexi's was on Sat., May 10, to celebrate Mother's Day.  I made a reservation a week in advance for 5:00 PM dinner with my husband and mother-in-law.  We had never been to Alexi's before but the reviews were great, so we took Mom for her special day.  We rode the light rail from Tempe and had a wonderful dinner, including cocktails, appetizers and dessert.  Our waiter was efficient and very personable.  The eggplant parmesan was wonderful (Mom's favorite) and the tortellini with vodka sauce and black beans was tender and tasty.  Service was impeccable and ambience was delightful.  We especially enjoyed the total absence of crying, screaming children!!!  The food was great, the bill moderately priced.   ",5
" I think Alexi's is a great place in Central Phoenix for lunch.  The food and service are great, however the noise level can be a bit loud. ",5
 I often go to Alexi's for lunch. I ordered the salmon simply grilled with lemon. The vegetables were perfectly cooked and seasoned just right. I will return for lunch - Alexi's is a definite constant on my dining list. ,4
" We were looking for a good restaurant, reasonably priced and with GOOD food, not too far from the Arizona Theatre.  We found it.  Alexi's Grill had a varied menu with some great specials and the prices were amazing.  My husband ordered a premium vodka Martini...cost was $5.00!  I had the duck special which arrived crispy, not greasy, and with a great orange sauce.  My husband got the salmon and it was delicious as well.    We will return regularly.  What a pleasant surprise!  We made the reservation on Open Table and we were thanked by the Maitre ' D for making it.   ",4
 We had a group that was joining us for the Dining Out for Life event.  We weren't certain on how many people would show up and we did end up with more than expected.  The staff was very accommodating in adding tables/seating for our additional guests.  They even called ahead to ask about special arrangements.   ,5
" Alexi's never misses, perfection in food, service and prices!  VERY busy all the time, loads of regulars..........terrific service!   ",5
 The service was exceptional and very courteous by all those who serviced our needs at the dinner table. The food complimented this as well and would return in a heartbeat if and when a need would arise. ,5
 Delightful experience.  Food was delicious and service just right.  We were made to feel welcome and no hovering. Loved the atmosphere - light and bright.   ,5
" Unfortunately it's been over a year since we were able to return, but it was as good as we remembered! We sat outside, had great service and great food. We'll definitely be back! ",5
 This was our second time there.  It is a very good location for when we go to plays at the Phoenix Theater.  Food is always good.  Prices are just right for the entrée.  Very nice and professional wait staff as well.  Nice ambience--very Italian with a good sized patio out front if it's not too warm. ,5
" This restaurant has good food and good service. The only thing is that the typical age group for this restaurant is a bit older than most young people would be willing to be surrounded by. It is no doubt good value price vs quality of food. However, just not a place for ""hipster people"" to go. I was not aware this place was like this. However, I'll return solely for the food. They definitely know how to cook here1 (only suggestion is go easy on the oil next time) :) ",3
" We have eaten at Alexi's Grill several times and each time we love it more and more. The service, ambiance and the food are all top notch. We wish we lived closer to Alexi's as we would definitely dine there more often. ",5
 You feel as if you are a local sitting at the bar. Everyone is very friendly and the bartender always has a drink ready for you. The service was outstanding and the food was very good. I had the steak pasta and the steak was cooked perfect and the burgundy sauce was light and flavorful. ,4
" The food was delicious, however the staff seemed harried and hurrying from place to place. Restaurant was packed, so I know they were busy, but I felt like I had to eat quickly then leave. Coffee at the end of the dinner was cold, however was replaced with hot coffee when requested. I've eaten here before and the ambiance and noise level is usually quite nice and much quieter. ",3
" We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner! Service was good, food was delicious and hot, noise level wasn't bad and we will be back! ",5
 Food was very good...garlic level was perfect and the waiter was very attentive...pricing was appropriate as well... ,4
" I have been there before and it is usually great, though last night they were very busy we hardly saw our server the hostess was the one to take our order, then my salad was ok not great as it usually is! ",4
" We love dining here before attending the Symphony. We can always count on a delicious meal in a relaxing environment - never rushed, but always out on time! ",5
" We always enjoy Alexi's. Food is consistently very good, as is service. ",5
 The only thing better than the food is the service! ,5
 Full menu that satisfied everyone. ,4
" We have been returning to Alexi's for more than seven years for its food, ambiance, friendliness, and quiet. We found them all on Valentine's Day except for the sound level, which was energetic to say the least because they were so busy. The food and service were still top notch, though. We will go again, but probably not on Valentine's Day. ",4
" I had reservations and was seated immediately, the service was excellent as well as the Orange Duck and Shrimp Scampi I was a little disappointed the restaurant did not have a full menu because of Valentine day; I would have liked to order the portofino. Where we were seated it was quiet until later in the evening. Overall an excellent night. ",4
 Great food and wonderful ambiance!! ,5
" This is our restaurant to celebrate Valentine's, we have done it yearly since the first time before we were married , just about 19 years ago. ",5
 Our party of 8 all enjoyed their meals Food was great and our waiter was terrific - attentive and accomodating. ,4
" The food is always fresh and delicious, the service is excellent and the price is extremely reasonable. ",5
 Love the wine Good was good not really worth the price The place was old and the rusty But they tried hard so I recommend to try atleast once Am I going back? No because it was nothing special ,3
 Always enjoying eating here. Great food and service!! ,5
" Was looking for a restaurant that was reasonable and not to far from the Phoenix theater. Alexi's was in a very good location for where we were going. Being Italian, I'm picky about Italian restaurants. I would definitely dine here again next time we go to the theater. ",4
 loved the dinner. going to a play downtown and it's the perfect place. waiter great and food delicious. what more could you ask for. ,4
" Alexi's is easy to find and easy to park. The restaurant if beautiful. The food excellent. The price reasonable. The staff is very personable, friendly and efficient. Had a great meal and a wonderful time. ",5
 Pleasantly surprised by the food and beer quality. ,5
 We go here a lot. This day they were just a little off. The food wasn't as good and the service was sloooow. I'll give them another try because they usually are better. ,4
 This is fine establishment.  They have great tasty food and it is not super expensive.  What more can you ask for? ,5
 My wife and I decided to do a simple dinner for valentine.  An I found this place . The food it's good menu limited.  But good burgers.  I hate to say it. But the service was bad we sat down and we waited 10 minutes for a server to come to get us menus ended up getting up myself and getting the menus since our server come by the table 2 minutes later I asked us what we wanted to drink we have never been here before and she didn't even explain the beer list so we decided to pick a couple of beers they weren't  bad but if you go sit at the bar ,2
" It nice that you are allowed to taste the beer before choosing one. The web site does not have an accurate list of the beers. If you are looking for a particular beer, call first to see if they have it. ",3
" We loved the bar, veggie burger and Parmesan fries were great as was the bear! Thanks ",4
" Had a great meal here with the four of us having everything from pasta to pork chops to salmon and shrimp.  Everyone went home pleased with their selection and the service and timing of the food was very nice and not rushed.  We commented while there that we could hear each other across the table.......the large groups that came in later may have changed that, but for our early seating it was lovely. ",5
 Salads came and food within 2min later. Bad timing. Steak had no taste. Wine was good. Server was average. Have to take the resturant off the downtown list. Not as good as the original. To bad. ,3
 Bartender was the best !!! ,4
" Second time there for a company dinner, great service and delicious food. ",5
 Great spot for dinner before a concert at Symphony Hall. ,4
" It was beautiful and quiet. My girlfriend and I enjoyed the food (of which there was a good amount for what we payed), and the staff was very friendly and accommodating. ",4
 It’s 10 minuets to the Orpheum Theatre and right by the stadium. Service was quick and food delicious. ,5
" We were so pleased with our experience!! The food and the service were top-notch, and we’ve been recommending it to all our friends ever since. ",5
" Mancusos is one of our favorite restaurants. It NEVER disappoints. We usually go there prior to the Herberger Theater or the symphony.  We often take friends and everyone of them says they are going back on their own. Had scallop and scampi Alfredo. Cannot say enough good things. It was terrific. My husband had a shrimp cocktail (huge shrimp) and a Ceasar salad and a veal chop. That is often his ""go to"" meal and he looks forward to it every time. We love it there! ",5
" Was  absolutely blown away by this place. I chose this place out of random, cause my BF told me to pick a place, and Mancuso’s seemed romantic enough for our date &amp; also it was close to the Symphony Hall for Harry Potter Symphony :)! Service was great! Loved our waiter, wished I gotten his name so I can put him on this review. But it was an older man with glasses. He was beyond amazing and well polite, he really seemed like he enjoyed his job. The Ambiance of the place was fancy &amp; classy, a Candle lit dinner, with low lighting. Perfect place to enjoy each other company. The food was amazing, really tasteful and well garnished. I had the Atlantic Salmon while my BF has their steak Oscar style(he loved it). I got a cocktail called “Orange Cosmo” was very Delicious 😋.  Really wished he had room for dessert and also more time as well, cause we were in a bit of a time crunch to make it on time for the show. Looking for a nice fancy dinner for date night. This is your place &amp; you won’t be disappointed :)! ",5
 We went to Mancuso’s for NYE. The service was fantastic from the hostess to the bar tenders to our waiter. We were so excited to try a different restaurant but the food was just mediocre. We had two mixed drinks that weren’t very tasty. One was an Italian take on a margarita. The lobster fra diavolo has zero spice to it. The filet mignon was a bit tough but cost $54. It wasn’t awful or anything but I just feel it’s overpriced for the food quality. ,3
" Cocktails came out fast; pre-made? Negroni was worst I've tasted. Another cocktail was too syrupy sweet. Bad start to an average meal at high prices. Good service. We've tried this place several times, reluctantly repeating because of its location. Won't go back. ",3
 Good food and prices but place is a bit sleepy even at 7p on a Saturday night ,4
" The chef special halibut was awesome.  I really don’t remember what was in it, I inhaled it so quickly.  It was just delicious.  Service was good and drinks were decently poured. ",5
" Elegant atmosphere. Friendly, mature service. Timing between our salads, then pasta entrees was exceptional. We will go back soon. ",5
" We were so happy with our dining experience.  We were hosting a family reunion before the Cactus Bowl and we could not have picked a better place to have lively conversation and amazing food!!  The waiters were professional, helpful and extremely friendly.  Thank you for treating my family like your family!! ",5
 We really enjoyed our meal here Christmas Eve.  The service was beyond excellent and the food was wonderful.  We would definitely eat here again. ,5
" Food was very good, although surf and turf was pricy (69). Salads were very flavorful and fresh. ",4
" Mancuso's was a favorite of ours when it was at the Borgata.  We were thrilled to see it is now in downtown Phoenix!  The location is convenient, the food was excellent and the service was terrific.  I especially liked the flavored tea and was kept well supplied.  The ambience is peaceful and enjoyable.  I had clam linguine and my sister had angel hair pomodoro;  both were excellent but we both preferred the pomodoro.  The bruschetta was superb.  Thank you, Mancuso's! ",5
 There was absolutely no one in the restaurant but it seems like it caters to business lunch??  The food was mediocre at best.  I had a pasta with tomatoes and basil (i think pomodoro) and had to ask for salt and other things to give it a little flavor.  I would not recommend or go back. ,2
" I had a wonderful night at Top of the Rock. The food was delicious and the courses were brought out in a timely manner. The views were spectacular. I was there for my birthday in May 2011 and since then I think they have gotten a new chef. The food was good then, but was even better this second time around. My coworkers also loved the food. One of them said the steal was the best they have had. We all loved the corn dogs especially my sons. I will definitely head back in especially now that the weather is cooling off to sit in the patio area with the beautiful views. ",5
 Fantastic experience and great food. It is a place I will definitely recommended and will return very soon.. ,5
 Great location for dinner before a show.  Great service from Aaron - very friendly and efficient.  Specials are amazing. There was not anything served that wasn't great! Loved it! ,5
 Excellent dining and service was awesome and friendly. ,5
" Group of 7 met here for celebratory dinner after a conference.  It was a moderately busy Saturday night.  Overall, Mancuso did not deliver.  Service:  Disappointing.  I organized the dinner, called ahead of time, with questions about the menu, and ordered champagne for the table as soon as we arrived.  Then we were ignored for 30  minutes.  Attention to the table was sporadic at best throughout.  I was never recognized as the leader of the group--even at the end the waitress just held the tab up to see who wanted it.  Food:  The menu is interesting and the food was generally good.  However, one of the fish dishes was served cold.  Clearly poor organization between kitchen and wait staff.  We didn't feel we could send it back given the lack of service.  Environment:  Very positive, the restaurant is large enough that our group could have conversation even at a large table. ",3
 Not a great value.  I had the Halibut special and the fish was a little over cooked.  Martini's were very expensive.  Service was excellent. ,3
 Excellent cocktail selection and wine list.  I had the Manhattan &amp; it was perfect.  The meatball sandwich was delightful with large meatballs covered with cheese.  It was truly one of the best I’ve had.  We were in town for a conference and dined here for a late lunch.  I  would highly recommend this restaurant ,5
" Wonderful discovery! We were enjoyed our Saturday date night dinner at Mancuso 's. The vegetarian  paella was scrumptious with a nice mix of vegetables. We also enjoyed excellent service from our waiter, Aaron. ",5
 We had an absolutely wonderful experience at Mancusos. After shifting through menus and reviews for restaurants near Symphony Hall we settled on Mancuso’s. It did not disappoint. They accommodated is arrive a little late for our reservation on a very busy night and our server David was very attentive. There were options for every taste and at reasonable prices. Our food was delicious and the ambience matched. We work nearby and this will definitely be on our list of favorite spots from now on. ,5
" Our friends and we had our annual Christmas dinner together at Mancuso's and was very pleased with the food, service, and overall experience. Try the lasagna - hearty portions. ",5
 Everything was handled very well. The service was good and the food was very good and pried in line with any restaurant of the same type. Would go back ,5
 My family and I have loved Mancuso family of restaurants for over a decade and highly recommend to anyone who wants a great dinner each and every time. ,5
" We came back to Mancuso's because we'd had such a great experience with our meal a couple of weeks prior when our European execs were in town.  This second visit, though good, fell short of the awesomeness of the first visit - which was perfect in EVERY way.  Pros from this visit: ALL of the food (hors d'eouvres to dessert)  was super tasty &amp; sufficient portions.  My husband had the veal chop special with a mushroom sauce that was a-ma-zing!  Our water glasses never went empty and the support staff were very efficient at not interrupting our dinner conversations when they cleared plates, brought bread, filled glasses &amp; such.  Cons: The head waiter attending our table may have been new???  I had to ask for the specials of the evening and when he described the desserts, he left a lot out - I knew this because of our previous visit.  Things like the flourless chocolate cake being served with ice cream on the side - I had to mention the ice cream.  He was also pretty good at interrupting good conversation and only put wine in one glass before putting the bottle on the table.  Our previous waiter expertly put sufficient wine in each glass before leaving the bottle on the table.  Also, I ordered the same meal both times we were there.  The surf &amp; turf special (lobster &amp; filet mignon) was amazing the first time I got it.  Filet cooked perfectly, juicy and the lobster was outstanding.  The bernaise sauce on the filet was soooo good!  The second time, the lobster was smaller &amp; dryer, the filet a little overdone (not enough to waste time sending it back) and they were very stingy with the bernaise sauce.  All in all, it was more of an average meal than an outstanding one.  After our first visit, Mancuso's was a 5-star all the way &amp; I would TOTALLY recommend them.  After this most recent visit, 3-4 star and recommended with caveats. ",3
" This is our second visit and we were not disappointed. Our server was attentive and accommodating, making sure we got to our concert on time but never rushing us. We had soups and salads, delicious entrees, 2 of veal and 2 of seafood. We also shared “to die for” desserts. This will be a regular stop for us whenever we’re in town for an evening event. ",5
 Fun times after the symphony all the gals enjoyed the late afternoon ,4
" For two of the dinners, it was not the right food.  The food was just very average. ",3
" Very relaxing atmosphere, good food, little expensive. Great place for social occasions. ",5
 With a charming view accessible to all - Top of the Rock was an ideal destination dinner for my party. With busy schedules we were looking for a quality dining experience without having to travel far from Tempe. The dinner was impressive and each plate complimented the next. In addition to being a great experience for my friends - Top of the Rock is now on my list of places I can suggest to clients in town. I work for a software company located very close to the restaurant and I will definitely be bringing clients to the restaurant in the future. ,5
 The drinks werent that great but the rest was good! ,4
 Excellent for eating outside. Unlike Different point of view or the compass room the food is always good and you actually feel like you are eating in a park when you eat outside. Inside is outdated and loud. ,5
" To anyone who is on the border and needs an honnest review to give a clear view, here one is. This restaurant is a fantastic place to go for a date, annaversery, special event, etc. I would give advice to check out their menu before you go. They have outstanding food, but for picky eaters, it might present a problem. The view is fantastic and I would recommend getting a table by the window. I hope this will help someone out. Thanks ",5
" One of the best restaurants in the phoenix/tempe area. Great steaks, great seafood, and desert. Service was good. One of my favs for special occasions or when I need a truly great meal. ",5
" Very pricey menu, and slow service. ",1
" My wife and I celebrated out anniversary at Top of the Rocks. We had a wonderful evening and were greeted by courteous staff from the valet to our waiter. The restaurant is simply beautiful and typifies the rustic, yet modern feel of the Desert Southwest.  Our waiter was cordial, pleasant and never left us wanting for food, drink or privacy.  The scallops and filet were among the best we've had and fitting for a dining experience of this quality. ",4
" Top of the Rock has been our go-to for special, romantic evenings for the past 15 years. Granted, it has been about five years since we've last visited, and that's why we were looking forward to returning to celebrate 15 years together. Yes, Top of the Rock was our first date!  There was live music when we arrived, which we enjoyed. Soon after, the band was done and a Top-40s station was put on...disappointing and a little tacky. Speaking of tacky, for some ungodly reason, someone has decided that what was lacking in this scenic, romantic restaurant are a couple of flat-screened TVs over the bar area. Major detractor.  On to the cuisine....oh, the cuisine! It was top-notch, adventurous but not foreign. We'll be back for more! ",4
" The food was not worth it, but our server was great! ",2
" My partner &amp; I finally made the trek to this landmark restaurant &amp; i'm very glad we did. After driving up the scenic, winding driveway, we were greeted by a friendly valet. Upon entering, i really felt like i was on vacation somewhere else. it has a great vibe, with the stylish architecture, cozy ski-lodge interior, open kitchen &amp; big windows looking out on the city - very impressive. Our friendly server was attentive but not intrusive. We started with some seafood appetizers to share. We had some delicious ceviche - very refreshing. We also indulged in the scrumptious stuffed shrimp, followed by fantastic seared scallops. The steak filet was perfectly seasoned &amp; cooked, w/ tender broccolini. For dessert: goat cheesecake - divine! ",5
" Fantastic Service, great views, a beautiful place tucked-in to Tempe ",4
" food was really not good....filets were dry...drinks were horrible...but the waiter was great...Joshua...fantastic...people smiled, very cordial...would go back..but not for the food..but the ambiance ",5
 This was my husband's 50th birthday and I wanted to make it a very romantic night. The view from this restaraunt was spectacular! Our waiter was so friendly and personable and the food was delicious. Will come back again. ,4
 The TOR did a great job once again. It is hard to top the view of the city.  The food was excellent with a Southwestern flair.  Once again an enjoyable intimate dinner. ,4
 25 years ago we went to Top of the Rock a couple days prior to our wedding and this trip was for our 25th anniversary. This isn't the same restaurant it has been in the past...and for the better. The focus is on amazing and complex flavors from ingredients that are locally sources from small growers. Steve was amazing and the rest of the team were friendly and inviting. Great job! ,5
" The filet was very good, but didn't care much for the spice combination used in the sides. ",4
 The food was adequate. Very good musician playing and nice environment. Drinks were small and overpriced. Filet was tiny and not well cooked. Salad was very good. Might try something else if we go back. ,3
 They took a great leap back from last time we were there. More like a sports bar than elegant dining now. Will not be back. ,1
" The restaurant is easy to find. We appreciated the complimentary valet parking. All the staff in the restaurant was super friendly and inviting. The view for dinner was great. We had the whole outside seating to ourselves for most the night. Our waitress, LaVita, was excellent. We will definitely request to sit in her section the next time we visit. The food was scrumptious. We enjoyed the Atlantic salmon and roasted chicken entrees. The restaurant offers a wide variety of wines, beers, and specialty liquor drinks. It was a great place to spend our anniversary dinner. ",5
" The filet mignon was perfect, the service outstanding and the view...breathtaking. ",4
" Amazing food with a spectacular view. We went right near sunset, so watching the skyline disappear and shimmer in the distance was gorgeous. ",5
 View great but food average and too expensive for the average food. ,3
" Another delicious meal framed by scenic city lights and fireworks! I noticed right away they had a new menu. Our starter, risotto with chorizo was cooked to perfection and nicely spicy. I had salmon and my niece had a big Caesar/shrimp salad; both were great. Dessert was chocolate bombe, which was as visually pleasing as it was delicious. The valet was fast and efficient and we were greeted by everyone. We never felt rushed. Top of the Rock seems to be stepping it up in every way (food presentation, taste and customer service) and I look forward to visiting it again soon. ",5
 Great food and outstanding service. ,5
" We came in for our first dinner at Top of the Rock and sat on the patio. There was a high of 105 that day but with the wind we felt comfortable enough, and once the sun went down it was absolutely beautiful. The food was good but our server was even better (can't remember her name). Would definitely recommend. ",4
" Service and view were great, but it is in dire need of a remodel. It is tired and worn out especially for an upscale restaurant. The menus are simple paper on small clipboards and the menu is limited. I will likely not go back. ",3
" I cannot recommend this restaurant higher. My husband took me there for my birthday and it was truly a special evening. We went on a Tuesday 40 minutes before our reservation with the intent that we would have a drink and enjoy the view. They were able to seat us right away at a table with a beautiful view.  We are not foodies by any means and we really didn't know everything we were ordering. Our server explained everything on the plate to us. We took advantage of a 3 course meal they were offering, and everything was better than the last.  If you are looking for somewhere to go with a romantic, relaxed atmosphere with delicious and decadent food, please choose Top of the Rock. We will be back! ",5
" Poor service. Poor wine list. Terrible food. Didn't even eat it. They didn't have prime rib as on the menu....""oh, we've been waiting for that to come in for a few days..."" Overall experience was just awful. Would not recommend. The only thing good about this restaurant is the view. ",1
" The view/ambience very nice, service very poor. ",2
 I took my girlfriend here for her birthday and I'm glad I did! The food and service were both outstanding. The restaurant offers amazing views of the valley and it adds to the special occasion by making it romantic. I highly recommend this restaurant for a special occasion dinner. ,4
" Nice location. Great view. Easy to find. Small menu. Lots of HOT dishes might be nice to balance with some less spicy choices. Had the Scottish fish, which was great. Wife had Southwestern Pho which was spicy to point of sweating. We were warned it was spicy just took her by surprise. Not going to go at the top of our ""to go to again"" list but if invited we'd go. If cooler try and get a patio table. ",3
 Food was excellent. Great birthday dinner with friends. Fabulous view. ,5
" The food was tasty, but in small portions. The drinks were made very well. The best part overall was the decor of the restaurant, the view and service. The cost was a little high considering the portion sizes. ",4
" The food is just good, but great views of Phoenix and a very nice patio for a late dinner. We had a great server, very friendly! The food is just good, nothing too great everytime I've been there, but it's fun to sit outside and enjoy the views. ",4
 Great view and nice for special occasions. ,2
" I think I was remembering the Top of the Rock from 10 years ago. I was disappointed to say the least. The menu had very few choices, of those I chose the Fillet and it was VERY good. Unfortunately that was all that was very good. The Wine I chose from the list wasn't available, had to find one they had. The server tried to make up for the short comings of the restaurant but when we ordered desert and she had to come back and tell us again that they were out of what we ordered, that was our signal to get the check. All in all it was a $$$$ meal for very little. ",2
" My girlfriend and I both went for the very first time. We both enjoyed ourselves very much. Food was good, maybe a little over priced, but not bad... The atmosphere was very nice. And the view was great. We both would go back again. ",4
" Server was inept, reaching over people to set plates down, forgetting parts of our order, etc. Same with the buss staff. Obvously their customer service team needs some training. We all ordered the prime rib medium rare...each of the four meals were cooked differently -- very inconsistent. ",3
 Excellent for a romantic dinner. The view is amazing. ,4
" Great location, nicely located within 6 blocks of most of the entertainment venues. Has validated. Parking in the Bank of America Building. Something for everyone on the menu. Be warned some of the special combination get pricey. ",4
" Absolutely fabulous dinner. Thank You, We had an early holiday party for work and it was the best we have had in quite a while. ",5
" What a great find! It was quiet, the service was impeccable, the food was great.  The only downside was finding it as we were from out of town and our app directed us to the garage.  It took a few minutes to realize it was was in that building. Great decor and wonderful ambience, perfect for a special occasion. ",5
 I had the Ribeye Steak.....beef is apparently from Northern Italy. It was awesome. Unique flavor. My wife had Butternut Squash Raviolis and Broccolini.....And we always have their Caesar Salad. Delicious and great value. ,5
" Check your bill.   Other flaws could have been forgiven, but an “error” that big is a dealbreaker. ",2
" My daughter , my sister and I went to Pomelo for a late afternoon meal w/drinks. We all switched to the vodka Chile Mule cocktail after comparing drinks. It was delicious! We shared a pizza and salad and loved our meal. So beautiful outside at Pomelo and with the excellent service we had, we couldn’t have had a better gathering! ",5
 Everything...Place is awesome in every way! ,5
" My 3rd  Time there, and always great service, food, and atmosphere! The manager Gilly is wonderful and does such an amazing job running the place! You must try the hummus app when you go! Enjoy the patio while the weather is so nice! ",5
" My overall experience was fantastic.  We were seated immediately upon arrival, and they quickly accommodated my request to be on the patio.  The service was quick and attentive, laid back while still remaining professional.  The food was FANTASTIC.  Every person in my party of four was incredibly satisfied with their meal.  The portions are large and very reasonably priced.  We did not get dessert, but I'm sure that would have been wonderful too.  I definitely recommend Pomelo for either dinner, or even just drinks and appetizers.  Their outdoor seating options are very nice and beautiful. ",5
 Very good food. Wait staff was helpful but seemed a bit inexperienced. Noise level was excellent and nice ambiance. ,4
" They were a little off this last time. Our guest was made to feel awkward because he got there before us -- and even though the restaurant was largely empty they balked at seating him and seemed unfriendly until they knew there was a reservation. I only mention this because out the many times we have been there this past year, this was a first. The kitchen seemed discombobulated too. Things cane out incomplete. No butter with the french toast... very slow drink service, etc...   I hope it's a one off -- we love this place and the people who work there ",4
" Didn't seem like wait staff was very organized. So much chaos. Often we would see staff laughing in the kitchen about whatever vs. attending to their customers. Assuming it was part of the management staff, would often come and give more water and tea at my table, hardly saw our waiter. After waiting for a cocktail ordered 15 minutes into sitting down I was informed the bar ran out of a specific mixer to make the drink. How can a restaurant run out of alcohol at 6P? Why did it take 15 minutes for the waiter to tell me? No offer for ""another drink"" no suggestion, just ""sorry, we're out of this. Are you two ready to order?"" Burger wasn't cooked the way I asked, one lady in a leopard print shirt asked ""how was the food?"" Before I could get my words out it was ""ok, great, thank you for coming in?"" Even the bus boy ignored my comment about the burger. I overheard a table outside state the same thing, I saw burgers going back to the kitchen and again wait staff or management staff LAUGHING at the requests. If you're going to slap on a ridiculous price for a burger, at least respect the people ordering it when the food is undercooked. I went to culinary school, I know undercooked food. ",3
" We had a great time!   The weather outside was perfect and the patio was shaded and breezy.   The waitress was fabulous; always there just when we needed something.   And, the food was terrific.   I'll return and suggest this restaurant for everyone. ",5
 Excellent food and atmosphere ,5
 This was our first time at Pomelo and it was a great evening. Love the patio and open space of the facility. The service was outstanding! ,5
" Nice neighborhood casual dinner place.   Service was great, pizza delicious, and a great pizza &amp; bottle of wine special.  Great sides. ",4
" The ambiance and food were amazing, can’t wait to go back. ",5
" Our first visit to Pomelo, and it won't be the last. A neighborhood gem, tucked onto a historic property. Food was outstanding, service top-notch. So good, that I brought another friend back the next day! ",5
" Food was delicious. Our group had the eggs Benedict, French toast and veggie omelet ",5
" We loved this place! Very friendly staff, food was delicious and atmosphere was perfect! Booths were super soft and comfy. Enjoyed sitting outside by fire after dinner. ",5
 Food was exceptional. Really enjoyed the pork chop. Was too full for dessert so will save that for next time. ,5
" This was our first time dining here on the 26th and we all will be back!   The service &amp; food is amazing (brussel sprouts, spinach dip, pizzas, &amp; salads were all delicious)! Everyone is so friendly and accommodating. We had a group of 7, and I was impressed by the service and food! We were also given a private room because they saw our party was on the larger side. The green room is perfect! We were asked if we wanted music and if the level was okay. The staff pays attention to the details which we all appreciated! They were also happy to split our check at the end which makes it a lot easier for all of us (even though it's more work on their end).  I feel bad I can't remember the hostess and server's names, but I remember their hair (brunette with short hair and a blonde with shoulder length hair). They were phenomenal!   We can't wait to come back again! I'm dying to try the brunch menu next. ",5
" friendly service, delicious food, accommodating and great atmosphere! Plan to return when the patio is open (and the weather is warmer)! ",5
" Each time I visit Pomelo at The Orchard I enjoy it more. The food is amazing, and the staff is always friendly and helpful.  Highly recommend. ",5
" Very bad service! Very bad! Not coming again, actually we are canceling reservation for  Christmas party for our office! ",3
" This was our first time at Pomelo. The food was very good and a ton of options on the menu!! We started with 3 orders of bruschetta which were fabulous! Then Husband ordered the Rib Eye, which was fantastic, son ordered the Pasta Bolognese which was very good, and I ordered the Short Ribs.  Our waiter was great also, personality plus!! Although we had mentioned we were celebrating our son's graduation, and the waiter acknowledged it when we sat down, we were not offered a chance to even order dessert. The bill was brought right after main courses finished. All in all, a GREAT experience, and if in the PHX area again, we will definitely return!! ",5
 Very pleasant lunch with great food! ,5
 This was my 4th time there and it was just as perfect as always. Great place for lunch with girlfriends. ,5
" Seems like the prices have increased significantly.  We had a Brussel sprout appetizer, two salads, French toast, and three iced teas.  Almost 90 dollars?    Wow.   No alcohol!   The food was good but the service was slow and they were not busy.  It is too bad I have to write this. ",4
" The atmosphere was wonderful, we sat outside the lighted trees and tent were beautiful.   We ordered a board to share and it was delivered and less than 5 minutes later our entrees were delivered.  We had to pack the entire appetizer up so that our dinner wouldn’t get cold. The spare ribs were wonderful. The bar b que ribs were dry and the coleslaw did not taste like it had dressing on it.  We will definitely try this restaurant again and hope the timing of the meal works better. ",4
 My husband and I had dinner there on a Sunday evening to celebrate my birthday. The restaurant was not crowded so we had no difficulty with parking or table selection.  The weather was pleasant and we sat on the patio.  We enjoyed the setting very much. The service was great - attentive but not intrusive.  The food was excellent! My husband had the ribeye and I had spicy fettucine.  We both were very happy with our meals. We stopped into the onsite ice cream shoppe for gelato dessert.  It could not have been better! ,5
" This was just overall...meh. From beginning to end, there was truly nothing special or memorable about the meal or the experience. This is unfortunate, considering the ambiance (which is gorgeous). Food was adequate--some hits and some misses. Mine came out actually cold--not lukewarm, but truly cold. This was remedied quickly, and made the food taste better, but that should not happen at all. Prices are really off the mark. There are salad options, and with these salads you can add a protein. Great! However, when you order a salad and add salmon to it, you're looking at a $27 salad. No thanks. Entree prices are fair to a bit high, and the  kid's meal we ordered was gigantic and inexpensive--so consistency is just off. The biggest disappointment was the complete lack of acknowledgement of a birthday at our table. Upon reserving our table I requested a candle in a dessert. Apparently no one read it, because I did order a (very dry and disappointing) chocolate cake. No candle, no happy birthday wished (despite the request and the obvious gift bags at the table). I realize this constitutes a first world problem...but when you go out for a special meal, I guess you should expect to feel special! This decidedly did not. A little extra staff training might fix this problem--I would hope. Who knows? ",2
" Rather good. Service was nice, and the margarita pizza was divine. I would definitely recommend this to a friend, as it was really nice. ",4
" We went here for the first time on a date and ordered an appetizer, salad, and main course to share. We were halfway done with our delicious appetizer when the server brought out the salad and the main dish at once. It felt like we were being told to get out quick and it really disrupted the dinner experience. We won't be going back. ",3
" Nobuo Fukuda is the most creative chef in Arizona and a wonderful person.  The cuisine includes both cooked poultry, meats and fish, as well as, fresh sashimi.  Every dish is a culinary delight.  The desserts should not be overlooked because they are fantastic and worth visiting the restaurant, if only for these finishing delights.  If you are not a fan of sashimi, don’t let that scare you because the cooked dishes are out of this world, too. ",5
" Nice decor, indoor and outdoor seating. Pretty active at 6:30pm on a Wednesday evening. Standard menu nothing to crazy. Typical large plate,  moderate portions, my wife's ribs was a very full plate. Bruchetta was pretty good.   Prices are in the $30.00/range inc drink, tax and tip.    Waiter was okay.  For this type of restaurant expect service to be prompt, competent, and friendly expecially if less than 1/2 full. Waiter had to check with the kitchen a couple of times, and we were ordering standard items off the menu.    There is also the more casual self-serve restaurant Lucie's next door as well as the ice-cream bar (Slush), all part of the same group.   Will go back as in the neighborhood. I do wish could modify the rear parking and place  parking spots at an angle, as limited room means some back-and-forth getting parked. ",4
" Excellent restaurant - food, wine, patio, service. Love going for lunch on Monday/Tuesday - pizza and bottle of wine for $20. HIGHLY recommend. ",5
 Wonderful setting to enjoy great food and service. Will definitely be back! ,5
" Service was great... food was horrible. I ordered the ribs, and they were hard as a rock.  My friend ordered the spaghetti bolognese and the pasta was a clump.   Hats off to the manager for taking off the horrible meals off the bill. ",3
 Some of the best food you will have in the Valley at 2/3 the price compared to Scottsdale ,5
" My go to place when I’m in town for meeting, excellent food quality and service.  Chef Nobou offers fix menu and a la cart as well with seasonal farm fresh.  You can also request for amakase in advance.  Highly recommended and I would be back again. ",5
 Perfect food. Had $80 tasting menu and added special octopus fritters. Very awesome! ,5
 Nobuo is an extra special treat.  The food is amazing and I highly recommend the tasting menu.  This little gem deserves more attention but I am selfishly happy it flies under the radar ,4
 This was our second dinner at Nobuo and was even better than the first. This is likely my favorite restaurant in the country. ,5
" Great service. Food was really good, very fresh. ",5
" Creative food with incredible execution and delivery. I am unable to emphasize enough the quality and creativity of each dish. I’ve visited twice in the last four weeks and I am looking forward to the next visit,hopefully soon.   Some dishes are on par with Eric Rupert at Le Bernardin.   Thank God Nobuo is not in DC NY or even Scottsdale as getting a table would be impossible. ",5
 Always a lovely time at Nobuo at Teeter House. Food is top-notch. Staff is attentive and knowledgable without being pretentious. ,5
 excellent food and service that try’s - food came out quick and was well prepared and unique - the only challenge I had was the speed in which alcohol was provided - we waited 30 minutes for our first drink to arrive — service was superb other than that - loved our server - ,5
 Amazing. Worth every penny! Go enjoy a night out at Nobuo ,5
" Never disappointed. Menu is always creative, food is delicious. ",5
 Food and ambiance was great. However we did not recieve our 3rd entree after an hour and a half while mentioning it to the server that we had an event to attend. It never did arrive in time nor did they get it to us before we had to go after asking to box it up. Still had to pay for it though! ,2
 Food was very disappointing and pricey I would not recommend ,1
" A wonderful dining experience!  We enjoyed the Tapas and each was unique, delicious, and the presentation was exceptional.  Our waiter was engaged, enthusiastic, and fun!! He took time to explain each dish and gladly answered any questions we had regarding dishes and history of Nobuo.  I highly recommend Nobuo for a fun and unique dining experience; it was a perfect spot to take my out of town guests! ",5
" How many times do you run into a friend while changing planes in the Denver Airport in route to Phoenix and ask for recommendations on a restaurant in Phoenix? What luck for us our friend recommended Nobuo  and the food was beyond our expectations.  Nobuo is located near the Science Museum so we also go to enjoy the Pompeii exhibit after dining on a creative Sunday brunch.  The chef puts together ingredients that you wouldn't image.   I would fly back to Phoenix tomorrow just to enjoy Nobuo!   Word of mouth is the best recommendations.    Oh, yes, we were the only diners at the particular time we selected which was perfect, but I can imagine they get busy on the weekend evenings.  So reserving through Open Table is the way to go. ",5
" Grapefruit and Hamachi was very well balance of flavors. I had the Royal cocktail that was interesting and tasty. Octopus Fritters were on point with flavor and hit all the taste buds but the texture seemed slightly mushy and some of the bits of octopus were quite chewy. Roasted cauliflower was delightful and executed perfectly. Two wash ranch chicken was unique, enjoyed it but not blown away. Service was attentive and knowledgeable. The Japanese white wine is a must try. ",3
" Great food, always a pleasure dinning there. ",5
 This place was amazing.  So charming and service was fantastic.  Great ambience if you’re looking for a lovely evening in a beautiful setting. ,5
 Nobuo is always fantastic! ,5
" The food was creative and appealing both to the eye and mouth.  Everything was well thought out and presented beautifully.  The server was very knowledgable about the menu, and very attentive.  Great experience. ",5
" Everything was delicious, we went all out and got five different types of entrees and two desserts among the five of us. You could really taste how fresh the ingredients were, and the flavors married perfectly. ",5
" One of the best meals I have had in Phoenix, incredibly creative, complex, playful and amazing in-tune and educated staff. The Japanese style tapas where out of this world and larger plates are to die for! Highly recommend! ",5
" Without a doubt one of the best restaurants in Arizona. If not the most unique presentation, one of the top 5. You could put this restaurant in any major city and it would contend with the top 5 easily. We have a gem here, Phoenix. Save and go! ",5
" The tables are old and  battered. No table cloth. Ours was quite sticky, like a basement bar at 2 AM. My chair was rickety and uncomfortable. The bar selection is very limited and the waiter seemed to be proud of this shortcoming. The food runner asked us to move plates out of the way for her almost every time she delivered a dish. The soft shell crab- not fresh, VERY salty. Foie gras and raw fish dishes were delicious. They think a lot of themselves there. ",3
" Expensive but fantastic. Incredible food. Manny, our server, was great. ",5
" Hmm would have loved to give a better review, service was excellent and love the location, but the food just wasn't all that. Most of it was good, but none of it had a wow effect, also one major mishap when my date couldn't chew through one of the chicken dishes. We had the tasting menu at $100 / head, and you shouldn't wish you hit Pizza Blanco across the walkway instead for that price :( ",2
" Loved this place! We had the freshest ingredients, with such a nice variety.  We did the tasting menu with wine pairings. Hated for the experience to end, pure heaven, every nite.   Can’t wait to go back, very special place! ",5
" Our favorite restaurant, our favorite chef (we’ve followed him for 20 years!) whenever we want special delicious &amp; memorable yet comfortable and quiet. We head here! Thank you Chef for never disappointing us &amp; always surprising! This visit’s surprise? Japanese pumpkin cream with cranberries!!!! Delish! ",5
 Unique experience and totally worth it. Great Japanese dishes. Hamachi was excellent and so was the waygu beef. Presentation of the food was incredible. Great place for a date and the dress is casual. ,5
" Great service, ambiance, and delicicious food!  Took my wife out for her birthday dinner, and she loved it. ",5
" Phenomenal. One of the best dinners we have ever had. That's saying something. Treat yourself to the tasting menu with wine pairings. We even ordered a couple extra dishes before the dessert course because the food was so good. Sashimi is incredibly unique, each fish served with delicious and complex flavor accents that complement but not overpower the fish. Every server had great knowledge of the food and wine and quickly found an answer for the rare question they couldn't answer. Too bad we live on the other side of the country. ",5
 This was a fabulous meal. It was one of the best that we have had. All the sushi was melt in your mouth and the soft shell crap curried lamb were of the highest quality. It was simply amazing. The service was of the highest calibre.   Price was good for the quality. Good sized proportion and knowledgable helpful staff  Well worth the visit. We would defiantly travel here again. ,5
" Truly one of the most perfectly balanced meals I’ve had in years, from flavor, texture, presentation and service. Sushi was perfectly tempered, not ice cold ",5
 Loved the staff and the food! Fantastic. And incredible ambiance. ,5
" Pomelo at the Orchard never disappoints! We had a delightful birthday brunch outdoors. Weather was perfect, food was delicious, and the service was spot on. Our favorite place to dine and enjoy cocktails at the bar. ",5
 Great birthday dinner . We got greeted right away and walked to our table in a timely matter. Staff was confident and everything was running perfect ,5
" Wonderful experience at Pomelo. Love the ambiance outside on the patio. We had a table by the fire and the noise level/temperature was perfect. My wife and I split the garlic focaccia appetizer and the mushroom pizza, and both were fantastic. The balsamic reduction and the caramelized onions on the mushroom pizza won me over on the first bite! We will definitely be going back! ",5
 Great appetizers but I would prefer more fish options for the main course. ,5
" Fabulous find. We all loved the outdoor dining. If they could  find a way to keep the flies away from us, this could be a 5 star rating. It wasn’t bad until Birthday dessert arrived and most other diners had left already.  The flies seemed to come from all over to join us which was annoying. Otherwise- Food was great. The roasted Brussels sprouts were the best anywhere.  Portions were generous. ",4
 Excellent prix-fixe menu. Amazing combinations of ingredients that unfold in your mouth like chapters of a story. Really fun dining experience. Excellent saki selections. ,5
" A great experience.  The tasting menu was a great way to experience many of the dishes. Nice ambiance and excellent service.  Good for special occasions as it is pricey, but overall worth it! ",5
" Great meal, we had a great variety of items and enjoyed them all. Only problem was when we ordered dessert it was ""servable"" but we were still charged for it and didn't notice that until we got home. Otherwise Service and food was great! ",4
 This is only the second restaurant I have found (first one in AZ) that has Okonomiyaki on the menu.  Of course I had to order this and it definitely did not disappoint.  Food was excellent.  The decor was a little disappointing as I would have thought/liked there to be more Japanese decor. ,4
" After several years of intending to go to Nobou, we finally made it. Dinner was very good, almost excellent. Very good cocktail list which paired well with the food. Ordered from al la cartel menu. Tasting menu was also offered, but had same items, just more of them. We had five items to share, which was just about right, maybe one more would have been OK. Food was certainly Japanese in style,  but quite different than most Japanese restaurants we have been to in the past. Four of the items were excellent, only the salmon sashimi first course was slightly disappointing, with not much flavor, although it looked great on the plate. Fritters with orange marmalade sauce for desert was also excellent.  Prices were quite fair for quality of food. Setting in old home was OK, but didn’t add much to the overall experience. Service was fair, although our server seemed knowledgeable and was friendly. ",4
" We loved the food, but our server could’ve been a little more attentive. He was great recommending dishes, but he was MIA at times. ",4
 The filet mignon was cooked very nicely. We ordered rare and thst's what we got.  Sides were good and complemented the steak. ,4
 I took my mom here for mother's day. She loved it and I did too. I got the buffalo ribeye and it was awesome. The parmesan potatoes that came on the side were great too. The dinner was expensive but worth it for a special occasion. ,5
" I loved how they present tasty vegetable sticks with ranch dip along with the excellent biscuits. I took my mom there for Mother's Day; as she usually orders the same thing I do I can only evaluate one dish. The 7 oz sirloin was cooked exactly the temp I wanted; the whiskey sweet potato mash was yummy, and we shared a piece of the decadent chocolate layer cake. Our server was awesome, attentive without hovering, and explained the menu well. A nice touch was all the moms got a $25.00 gift card for a later visit to the restaurant.  Now, I do think it was a touch overpriced, and this is a strictly ""special occasion"" restaurant for someone of modest means, but we will definitely go again. ",4
 Great Place to have a special get together is just have a casual dinner.  Food is excellent and the service is exceptional. ,5
" Server Dan was VERY excellent!  Really knows everything about steaks and he was outstanding.  My porterhouse was good, but it wasn't the best I've had.  I'd go back to try a different steak.  LOVE the decor and ambiance. ",4
 No wonder this restaurant has been around since 1947! Outstanding service. The filet melted in your mouth the Parmesan potato was amazing. unbelievable wine list. Delicious homemade salad dressings. Overall amazing experience! ,5
" Chateaubriand! I haven't had that dish since I lived in Europe. Wonderfully presented and tasted amazing! Paired with a nice bottle of wine from their extensive list, we were one happy couple. I'll tell other to dine there when visiting Phoenix! ",4
" WE ENJOYED THE QUIET, HOMEY FEE L. MY STEAK WAS A BIT SMALLER THAN  EXPRESSED ON THE MENU.  THE PORTIONS FOR SOME WERE TOO LARGE ESPECIALLY THE SLAW AND POTATOES.  THE BIRTHDAY DESSERT WAS DELIGHTFUL.  WE HAVE CELEBRATED SEVERAL TIMES FOR DIFFERENT OCCASIONS. WE WERE A BIT DISAPPOINTED FOR THIS EVENT. ",3
" After reading great reviews, we had hoped for a wonderful dining experience.  Did not happen! The waiter was Friendly, but we only saw him when he was selling something...wine? Appetizers?  Dessert?  Never asked how the meal was.  The food , top Sirloin was flavorful but tough ($45), my elk medallions were bland ($48). The roasted vegetables were good, but not worth the $148.00 tab for two.  We will not be back...too many restaurants  with better food, better service, and better value. ",3
 Was in Phx with friends and have always wanted to try this place -its been around forever - with they would have kept the old school charm of the place but overall great food and service - will def be back ,5
 Our first experience was not disappointing.  We are originally from Chicago where beef is king.  We were delightfully pleased with our meal and the beef was cooked to perfection and delicious. ,5
 Everything was fresh and amazingly good. Unique tastes. Unlike other steakhouses. The price is well worth it! The waiter was very kind and attentive. He also showed me a bottle of wine so I could take a picture of the brand because I loved it! Definitely would go back when I return to Phoenix. ,5
 We had just a delicious dinner and the service was great!! ,5
 They have a very good selection of anything beef! Very old school take on everything which can be terrific if your taking your parents out for dinner! ,4
" Awesome, we love this place and visit every time we are in town! ",5
 It was a very nice evening. We met up with some friends and had a nice visit ,5
 All four of us had steak and it was done the way we requested.  It was well worth the price. ,5
" I enjoyed the western-style ambiance, but I felt the meal was overpriced.  The basic steak and potato meal was delicious,  the service was excellent.  The price makes it more of a special occasion dining experience. ",4
 Waiter did an excellent job and can't wait to go back again soon! ,4
 We both enjoyed our dinners. Would go again in a heartbeat. ,5
 The Stockyards is an excellent restaurant and one of my all time favorites. It has been in Phoenix since 1947 for good reason.  They have amazing service where waiters/waitresses offer an experience and amazing service that is very rare now days in the food industry. A large majority of their steak is cut in house. Our family went there for a birthday dinner and I was treated to an 8oz filet mignon that melted in my mouth and was complemented by a delicious side of garlic mashed potatoes. Stockyards also has a massive selection of great wines and delicious beers! Stockyards is what other restaurants should look to for an example of how to do it right! ,5
" Celebrated a ""friend's annual get together"" here 4/9/16 and it was the first time for me to be here.  We were seated in a nice section in a booth and basically we could have sat there all night as we never felt rushed or hurried.  The waiter and servers were all very attentive.   The food was excellent and a large portion which was mostly taken back home!  The only negative thing that I can say is that the main course came out before some of the party was finished with the salad.  The waiter probably should have come by and asked if they were ""still working"" on the salad prior to the server standing behind him with the main course. The most fun part was the dessert...I had a deconstructed german chocolate brownie that looked like a slice of meatloaf (the brownie) with sauerkraut (the carmel; coconut and nut part of german chocolate cake) and mashed potatoes (which was in fact vanilla ice cream to be the icing of the cake)!  What a great dessert and it was DELICIOUS!!  Wonderful creativity!  I only wish I had taken a picture of it!   Overall a wonderful experience. ",4
 My wife and I were looking to try something new and I stumbled upon this place on Yelp. Had great reviews and I now know why. The Steaks were wonderful! Cooked to perfection and had wonderful flavor! The ambiance inside is very relaxing also. Just a down to earth restaurant with great service and great food! ,5
 Great food as always. Service was great too ,4
 WE ENJOYED A GREAT MEAL WITH OLD FRIENDS CELEBRATING OUR ANNIVERSARY. WE -- OUR 49TH OUR FRIENDS THEIR 52ND ,5
" The food and facility are outstanding.  There are many choices and unique blends of flavors that were outstanding.  We had one of the best steaks ever.  The facility, itself, has a lot of history and   it feels like you are stepping back in time.  What a treat to go here to celebrate our 25 wedding anniversary.  Thanks for a wonderful memory. ",4
" We have been coming to this place for many years now and we always find it to be consistently nice, well kept, reliably enjoyable.  The food is always great, service is always great, and even though it is quite out of the way for us, we keep coming back.     While this is a steak house where the steaks are amazing, they also do a great job on fish and chicken.  We don't always take big meat eaters along, so when I hear the fish lovers raving about how good the salmon or chicken was, I am tempted to order those the next time. ",5
" I come to this restaurant every time I visit the Phoenix area at least once.  It's always great.  The steaks are fantastic, the bread is delicious and the portions are big.  It's a great value, since sides are included.  I'd recommend it for anyone who enjoys a great chop house. ",5
" Western decor and old school ambiance are the hallmarks of this restaurant. Appetizers and salads are huge, so plan to split with one or more dining companions. Our steaks were cooked to temp requested. Not the most flavorful I've ever had (NY Strip for me, Ribeye for him) but tasty. We had a banquette so it was quiet and private in spite of a very full dining room. Service was unobtrusive, if not overly friendly.  2 salads and 2 steaks, no dessert for $125 before tip. ",3
 We got tickets to see a show at the Celebrity Theatre and found this restaurant  close by so we ate there for dinner. The atmosphere is old western with a very comfortable feel and the food was down home with delicious corn muffins and biscuits. The prime rib was done just right with a nice horse radish sauce . The wilted spinach salad was one of the best I've ever had. The server was great offering us more of those delicious biscuits and muffins. ,4
" We have eaten lunch and dinner here over the years. Been a while since we'd been here. Took some out-of-town guests for a special treat. Yes, the food was OK but the prices, in my opinion, were way too high. The value of the food and experience vs the price were not what I expected. We will think hard about returning. ",3
 Great history! GreAt location and Great food! Service is excellent. Everyone is so friendly. Love the building. Very relaxing. They don't push you to finish. ,5
" The Stockyards never ceases to impress. Consistently excellent food, coupled with great service and a friendly atmosphere make this my go-to for business lunches.  The service and excellent fare also make this an excellent choice for that special occasion romantic dinner. ",5
" Serrated knives should not be served to cut beef, especially rare beef. They just tear the meat. ",3
 Me and a good friend enjoyed an outstanding lunch.  Our waitress went out of her way to make sure we enjoyed ourselves and even had alot of fun with us.  Excellent Time. ,5
 Wonderful service awesome food quiet casual great recommend ,5
 Excellent steak &amp; prime rib dinners w guests from out of town. Great value for such fine food &amp; service. I believe this is the best prime rib in the Valley. Service is wonderful and unobtrusive.  Kudos! ,5
" We celebrated our 20th Anniversary there and the staff, food and the place in general was fantastic! Felt we were treated extra special because we were celebrating but I am sure they treat all customers like that....would definitely dine there again!!  Loved everything about the place! ",5
 We were there on a weeknight and it was still full. The reason was the food. Our server was from Kentucky and treated us extremely well. We had time with our predinner drinks and our food was served without rushing and it was hot and done correctly. Can not ask for more ,5
" Salmon and pork chop were excellent.  Ribs were very dry and flavorless and a great disappointment to the two who ordered them.  Overcooked and ""stale tasting."" ",3
" whether you want fresh fish, a dish of pasta, or a great salad, Alexis is the best business lunch in north central Phoenix. ",4
 Great atmosphere and great food. Alexis has one of the best romantic atmosphere for couples. ,4
 Best chicken alfredo I've had in a long time. Friendly and helpful staff. Great date night restaurant. ,5
" I was in Phoenix for a convention, and needed to find a restaurant to entertain a group of 15 people.  Alexi's worked out great - very good food, moderate prices, decent wine and attentive service.  If you want a place that won't break your travel budget, but will satisfy a diverse group, I would recommend this restaurant.  It's a bit removed from downtown, but the light rail stops at their location intersection.  I ordered some appetizer combos for the whole group to nibble on while each person awaited their entree.  Aside from the usual Italian selections, there were some Southwest inspired dishes, some Greek items, and surprisingly good seafood (for Arizona).  Try the Super Tuscan red - at $30 a bottle, it was a good value. ",4
 You don't need to worry about getting around and parking at Alexi's. The prices are a very good value based on quality and portion size. The trout almondine was a full filet grilled so the almonds are crispy brown and meat juicy served with roasted potato and veggies. You won't need a lot of sauce on the eggplant parm. The med sized cuts and meaty and it tastes like eggplant! End the meal with the NY cheesecake with strawberry drizzle as a chaser to the aromatic coffee. ,4
 This was my first time here and everything was great.  I used Open Table app for a reservation for the first time and it worked out great.  Would definitely recommend this place. ,5
" Never changes much and that is good. The owner , Michael is always there making sure all is well ",5
" Although the ambiance might be a little on the stark side, the rest of our experience during our first visit to Alexi's was terrific.  We had a drink in the bar before dinner and the bartender was competent and helpful.  The appetizers and main courses were enjoyed by all.  The poached salmon special was one of the nicest salmon dishes I've experience in a long time.  Two in our party of four had the shrimp fra diavalo and both raved about the dish.  We'll definitely add Alexi's to our dining rotation. ",5
" Great meal as always, computer glitch causing a considerable wait for the meal, but lots of apologies.  Place was packed as would be expected on New Year's Eve.  I have dined here several times since moving to Phoenix, and have always enjoyed the experience. ",4
" Even though we had reservations we were seated in the noisy bar area.  They were VERY short staffed. Our meals arrived cold.  We were there for 2 hours so we didn't send back our dinners nor order dessert.  To be fair, this was the 5th year we were here for New Year's Eve and our first bad experience. ",2
" We were visiting Phoenix and were looking for a place to have a family dinner. The restaurant is centrally located very close the Phoenix downtown, and we were very happy to find it. The owner is very friendly and was making sure we are happy all along. The food is excellent and the service is just superior, I do not recall getting such a good service at a restaurant. On top of that, the price is very reasonable, less than $20 for Entree.  I highly recommend it. ",5
 We had a nice time.  The food was very good.  I will definitely go back again. ,5
" My table was ready as soon as a rrived, I enjoyed the service, the food was great!  The selection from the menu is excellent especially for those dieting, I was able to stay on track with my diet. ",5
" This is restaurant is on my 'places to eat lunch' list. I ordered the steak salad w/pasta, the steak was tender and flavorful. The pasta sauce was a tangy tomato sauce with mushrooms. I enjoyed my lunch - as always. ",3
" Absolutely outstanding.  My wife and I have been dining at Alexi's for about 20 years, and have never had anything less than wonderful.  Michael and his entire staff do a fabulous job. ",5
 Visited Alexi's during a trip to Phoenix. Met with friends for dinner and the food was excellent with great service. ,5
 The filet was perfect and the service was outstanding! ,5
 I have gone to Alexi's for years &amp; always had great food &amp; service. ,5
 We have been to Alexi's many times for lunch or dinner and have never been disappointed.   The service is excellent and the food is delicious.  We plan to dine there again soon. ,5
 Nice food presentations. Good choices on specials. Salad was rather soggy but main courses were delicious.  Would definitely go there again. ,4
 Alexi's Grill has been a longtime favorite of mine. Great food. Great service. Great ambiance. The quality has been the same for at least 20 years. ,5
 The food at Alexi's was delicious!  Great quick service and the salad dressing was outstanding!!!! ,5
" We had to fight our way through the annual Cruisin' Central car show traffic and parking lot construction, but it was worth it.  The food was excellent as was the service.  The server was well-informed and efficient.  He sold me on one of the specials, which was a pork chop served with linguini.  Very tasty, and the chop was very tender.  Don't be deterred by the fencing out front, it's just the parking lot getting redone.  The restaurant is open and ready to go! ",4
 The food here is great! I have been coming here for years and haven't had a bad meal yet! ,5
 We have dined at Alexi at least 3-4 times in the past few months and it is always excellent.  We have intention to continue to visit and dine at the restaurant ,5
 Great food and a wonderful atmosphere for a business lunch.  Will have to go back for dinner. ,5
 Best salmon I have ever had.  Will return.  My friend lovvvved the trout ,5
" Fabulous food,  reasonable prices, good service and very pleasant surroundings. There were six of us, everyone was pleased and we'll all return. ",5
" Terrible terrible service! Waiter had at least 20 smoke breaks and reaked! We were one of five tables in the entire place and our food took about 45 minutes. Food was cold, overcooked and unrecognizable!  Shrimp was so chewy you couldn't even eat it.  The pasta with sausage and peppers was aweful. A simple dish of tomatoes and pasta tasted of bleach.  Seriously people how did this place get such good reviews? The only person in tune with us was the support staff.  Finally, after our ""waiter"" disappeared I couldn't take it anymore.  I had to talk to the manager and fill her in on everything.  She refused to let me pay the tab.  That at least was nice.  DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME or GAS going downtown to this place.  You will be disappointed. ",1
" I am never disappointed by Alexi's!  Great food, comfortable, but semi-formal, atmosphere, personal service...and the list goes on!  Always a pleasure! ",5
" The food was excellent and the portions were good size. Our server Mike did an outstanding job, definately a keeper. We live in Carefree and will make the drive for dinner again. ",5
 great staff to go with good food and service.  Best place for lunch in Central Phoenix--and for fresh fish. ,5
" My husband and I absolutely love Alexi's for the atmosphere, service and the food. We only wish we lived closer, because we would definitely be a regular customer. Whenever we have an event to attend downtown, Alexi's is our first choice.  We always get a great meal at a great price and are treated exceptionally well.  We look forward to our next visit. ",5
 Fun - relaxing atmosphere.  Great service and friendly staff. ,5
" The food is good, however, you have to like garlic as there is plenty of it in everything. The service is very prompt, almost too fast. Portions are generous. I would not call it fine dining but definitely good quality. ",4
 Always excellent food with excellent service. I've never experienced anything but excellence and I have been a customer since they opened. ,5
 Food was good and the service was terrific. Very friendly and remarkable at knowing when to be there and when to leave us to ourselves. ,4
" Alexi's is definitely a good place for a business lunch.  The food is very good, the ambiance is white table cloth, with excellent service. This is a perfect place for a business lunch especially for busy C-Level executives who have very little time but do need to take the time for lunch. The table are situated so that doing business is easy.  The noise level at times might be a little elevated but it really does not interfere with a conversation and actually provides a bit more privacy to your conversation.  I highly recommend Alexi's for a business lunch or just a friendly get together. You just can't go wrong with choosing Alexi's Grill. ",5
 We absolutely love Alexis! The food is absolutely delicious and perfectly served.  The staff is so friendly and willing to do what it takes to make sure you enjoy your meal. We were very satisfied! ,5
" I have never been or heard of Alexi's. The good was fantastic, service t match and a lovely atmosphere. Loved it! We will be back! ",5
" We had an opportunity to dine with representatives of a company that we wanted to know a little better on a personal level. The atmosphere, food, and service provided an ideal venue for this to happen ",4
 We had a wonderful evening celebrating an annibersary.  The service was excellent and the food very good.  We really enjoyed the relish tray and two kinds of rolls to start off the evening.  I had a salad and my husband had the steak soup.  Both were great. The only glitch of the evening was the timing .  The entrees came before we finished the salad and soup.  Our waitress did acknowledge the problem before we said anything . Otherwise a great experience .  Beautiful bar area too! ,4
 I recently hosted a baby shower event at Frank &amp; Alberts and we were given a very nice private room to have our lunch. The service was wonderful and the ambiance was amazing. This event went better then I expected thanks to the restaurant and their wonderful service. ,5
 The patio was delightful and the food was delicious! ,4
" We looked forward to our first visit to this restaurant situated in the beautiful historic Biltmore Hotel only to be sadly disappointed by a pathetic lunch at a high price. While we expected the elevated pricing at this venue we were surprised at the poor quality of the food. The hamburger recommended by the server was mediocre at bests on a large, stale bun and served with dried out ""duck fat"" fries. Even requested Dijon mustard turned out to be yellow hot dog mustard. The cobb salad was uninspired, dominated by lots of lettuce. Admittedly this was a late weekday lunch, but that's no excuse for this standard at the Biltmore. We won't be back. ",2
" I was in for a conference and stumbled upon this quiet restaurant. The menu offered a variety of options and the food was great - I had the special, prime rib and baked potato. The service was very good and the patio - I ate outside - was beautifully maintained. A great experience, I highly recommend Frank &amp; Alberts. ",5
 The salads and sandwiches were delicious and imaginative and we enjoyed the avocado appetizer. We had a private room since we ended up with a party of eight and it was quiet and conducive to a productive business lunch. ,5
 We had a group of 8 and they were prepared for us. We sat near the outdoor area by a fire but were comfortable with the door open for ventilation. The wine selection was outstanding and the service was impeccable. I really enjoyed the swordfish and everyone else enjoyed their entree as well. They handle large groups seamlessly. ,5
 they were slow with the water but besides that things were good. ,4
" Made our reservation for 7@7pm. We arrived and was shown to out table which was set for only 6 people. When I mentioned this to the hostess, she said our server will take care of it so we had to stand there until he arrived and brought over another chair and place setting. Service was slow. When our salads came out, we were short one and had to track down the server to let him know. We were all done with our salads before he got his. The food was just ok. Certainly not what you'd expect from a high end resort such as the AZ Biltmore. ",3
" our meal was a disappointment. we ate outside which was nice but it was so dark at our table that we couldn't see our menu or the check. the primerib was dry . we should have asked for and gotten au jus. The swordfish, and i am not even sure it was swordfish was so overcooked and tasteless. all 4 of us ordered baked potato. the sourcram etc came in portions for 1. we had to wait a while until they brought some more in their little tiny serving dishes. i had to ask for lemon at least 4 times before i got it for my fish which was then cold.the wine did not come at all until we asked for it when the entrees arrived. all in all a major zero for dinner. i would never recommend this restaurant. ",1
 The waiter was less than optimal. We ordered the same entre w one potato change but he somehow mixed it up. We had to ask for what the full course. We never did get everything. The food was ok. ,3
 Usually have great food at frank and Alberts but this trip was a big disappointment. Food wasn't good at all. ,2
" We reserved for Easter Brunch at 12 15 and were seated at 12 30 only to be told the breakfast bar was closing in 20 minutes so we would have to order from the menu or hurry up. The alternative we were given was to go to Wrights. ""But that brunch is $90"". So we made our own alternative... We left and went to Thomaso's instead. Open kitchen at F+A is quite loud and brunch they were serving was warmed over buffet eggs and pastries. Not very special for an Easter breakfast. Not impressive considering The Biltmore is supposed to be a Waldorf Astoria property. ",1
 The food is always good at Frank &amp; Alberts. Our waiter gave us horrible service and only checked on us once to give us our check. ,4
" Having visited Frank and Albert's before, I am sorry to say that this visit was distinctly disappointing. Our interminable wait to be seated by the hostess should have been a clue. The service at the table was sluggish with my wife having the distinction of waiting both for her soup main course and her coffee - the only lady at a table of 6 men and she was always without food in front of her! My corned beef sandwich was fatty and soggy. My cappucino cold and having no coffee - only milk. All the comfort we have previously enjoyed at this comfort food location was missing and, with only about 5 other tables taken, there is little or no excuse for delays both on the kitchen and the service end. ",2
" Whenever I visit Phoenix, F &amp; A's holds a special place for me to relax and unwind after a long day of travel and work. It embodies the spirit of Phoenix, amazing architecture, and a beautiful outdoor setting with lush gardens and a warm glow from fire pits. The food is always unique, fresh, and presented beautifully and deliciously. It's my favorite dining spot. ",4
" Food, location...........doesn't get much better than the Biltmore ",5
 Great spot at the Arizona Biltmore - indoors or on the patio. We had a wonderful meal. ,4
" Nice surroundings (we were seated on the patio). Food was acceptable but not spectacular, other than the Short Ribs Mac and Cheese - highly recommended! Service good but variable through the evening we were there. Will go back again though to give them another chance. ",3
" Great food, great outside seating. Looking at the stars seating by a fireplace after dinner. ",5
 Took a client here for dinner; wonderful all around and excellent for the occasion. ,5
" A lovely outdoor place to eat by a outside fireplace. Could see th stars and ,it was not jam packed. Could see a big family dinner happening on the othe side of the patio but did not disturb as separated by th glass wall off the veranda. ",5
 Just perfect for a late night bite ,5
" As a group of 4 we all selected the Prime Rib. It was seved at the deired degree of cooking. However, the meat itself was a disappointment as it was tough and not marbled.  We wre staying in the hotel and decided to go elsewhere for breakfast the next day based on the sub Prime Rib dinner. ",3
" It's always a treat to dine at Frank &amp; Albert's! The weather was PERfect for outdoor dining. Our wait staff was always nearby, but didn't seem to hover. How do they do that? Though the prime rib was dependably delicious, on this visit, I particularly enjoyed the jalapeno/cheddar bread! Delicious. What a gracious experience! Thanks, Frank &amp; Albert's! ",5
 Poor service ruined an otherwise good lunch. Excellent onion rings. Had to ask for water and drink refills; was almost ready to get up and ask for it. Also had to ask another server to take our payment. ,3
 Had a wonderful time with my husband to start of a great week to spring break. ,3
" The food they served was inedible. I wouldn't go there again. The food was cold, very expensive, and the staff was largely inattentive. They simply missed the mark and we won't be back.  I can't say anything good about the restaurant except the decor. Pretty sad. ",1
" My wife &amp; I visited Frank &amp; Alberts at least 8 times in the last 8 months. We stayed in the Biltmore for the food. In the spring thru fall they had a spicy vegetarian pasta dish that we both thought was GREAT. Any Vegan or carnivore would have loved it. (In the last year I became a Vegan). The entree included a slightly red spicy sauce, olives, capers, red peppers, artichoke hearts &amp; vegetables. It was GREAT. We drove from Tucson to Phoenix, 240 RT miles. When we tried to order our DELIGHT, it was not on the WINTER menu. There was only 1 boring VEGAN dish. AIl 3 of us were there for the spicy pasta dish. The chef would not consider making our dish or a facsimile. HE WAS TOO BUSY. VEGANS, check menu before coming here. NO CONSIDERATION 4 US. ",1
 A modern &amp; slick ambiance. Hip wait staff very knowledgeable. Hummus needs some love and attention but entres were really well thought out and presented artfully. ,3
" Food was fresh, just the right amount of spice, cooked to perfection. The service was exceptional, and the outdoor area was great. The fish tacos, smash guacamole, veggie pizza, and the sampler desserts were fantastic, and the celery caesar a pleasant take on a standard dish.  The only issue outside were the birds that swooped the instant a table was vacated - but what can you do? It's outdoors! ",4
 Food and service was great. My drink from the bar was awful. It was supposed to be made with Grey Goose... Tasted like rotgut vodka. Should have sent it back. ,5
 We can always expect a great luncheon with friends while dining at the Stockyards.  The waitstaff and management always seem to welcome us back to enjoy. ,5
" My wife and I were celebrating her certification as the newest Tovrea Castle at Carraro Heights Docent. What better way to celebrate than to have dinner in the restaurant established by Big Phil Tovrea. Their staff was great, and the history and atmosphere was wonderful, with a rich feel. My wife had a wonderful pecan encrusted walleye, and my prime rib was very tender, although my chili was way too salty. A little pricy, but the old bar and wonderful photos and Art bring back Phoenix in the 50s. Great celebration! ",4
" I took a group of business executives here for dinner. It was a good experience. They were very accommodating for our group - as we added a couple of people at the last minute.  The service was a little slow to start though - it took about 30 minutes before they came to take our order. But the wait staff were friendly and helpful and once the order was in, the food was prompt. The food was well cooked, and cooked to order. A great meal. Pretty pricy - so make sure it's for the right occassion. And, although they did have options, it's feels like a high end steak and potatoes place.  A good fit for my audience that evening. ",4
 Prime rib was fantastic! ,5
 The Stockyards is consistently excellent. ,5
 This place has an awesome vibe and good for groups so close to town. Steaks were amazing. ,5
" The steaks were very good, and done just right. We had so much food and had to bring it home. The waiter was great... Harry the bar tender was great as usual. It's a neat place  to have dinner, with all the history of the west. The prices are very reasonable and that's really great keep it that way,,,,, ",4
" Enjoyed the 12oz Prime Rib, best I've found in PHX ",5
 Took three attempts to reorder a round of drinks. Steak not prepared as ordered but could not locate waiter to have it sent back. Had to ask three times for condiments. Food was overly salted ,3
" The atmosphere is fantastic, great history, beef melts in your mouth and the wait staff is knowledgeable and friendly. ",5
" Brought friends who hadn't been there before.  They liked the food, service and the bar. ",5
" Had an excellent meal at Stockyards. It has an old time feel. The tray with carrots, olives, celery reminded me of supper clubs of my youth. The corn muffins were to die for.  I was glad to see prime rib featured: this dish has faded from many menus. Mine was perfect. ",4
" Me and my girlfriend went here for Valentine's Day and we both had the 12oz filet mignon it was pretty amazing it just melted in your mouth also an outstanding baked potato with sour cream, butter, chives, and bacon that you will dream about very great food and service I will definitely be back ",5
 Celebrated Valentine's Day. Had a great booth that was John Wayne's favorite booth. ,5
" Had to send steak back, while I waited for it, my boyfriend was nearly done, the time I got it He was done, took a couple bites of mine, the second one was great, but had to take it home  because my boyfriend was already done, and I didn't want too have him wait for me, very  noisey, but it was Valentine's Day and was packed. ",5
 For valintines  great quiet atmosphere waitress suggestions great service outstanding but not overpowering. Grilled prime rib wonderfull ,4
" This was a phenomenal evening at the Stockyards for my wife and I.  Our server was perfect;  only there when needed but always available, aware of our needs and quick with appropriate suggestions for both wine and food selections.  Everyone was aware that it was a special night for us and made it more so by placing us in the perfect location, a quiet booth with ample room and privacy.  The meal was cooked to perfection. We will be back next year if we are in town on Valentines Day. ",5
" Stockyards was delicious! We were the third people to be seated for the night so it was rather quiet, but the atmosphere was nice. Our waiter was good, however seemed to use a bit of pressure when ordering drinks and dessert. I asked for a fruity drink and he didn't understand what I was asking. Then I asked for a berry drink with vodka, and the waiter said ""look around, we probably don't have what you're looking for"", but before he said they had a full open bar and I asked for a fruity drink but he didn't understand. Overall the experience was good, but I'd only go there for a special occasion. ",4
" The filet and house potatoes were wonderful,  cooked perfectly. ",5
 There's a reason this place has been around for ever!!  The filet mignon's for all three of us where to die for. We will definitely be back next time we are in town!!! ,4
 Had to go for an early Valentine Dinner. We have wanted to go for fifty years.  It was our first time and will go again. ,5
" Enjoyed a wonderful dinner in a party of  7 guests last week.  We misjudged the time to get there from downtown Phoenix and the restaurant called my cell to make sure everything was okay and they held our table for about 20 minutes...greatly appreciated.  Good beer, cocktail and wine list...appetizers and salads were excellent.  Wonderful menu of steaks...different cuts and sizes...also the roast beef was very good...only less than wonderful entree was the ribs...okay...but just not as wonderful as the steaks and roast beef.  The sides are big enough to share.  I think we ordered four sides amongst the seven of us.  Great service and a great evening.  Highly recommend this restaurant if you are looking for a relaxed atmosphere and great food and service. ",5
 The service was quite good and relatively prompt. The food was good and cooked as requested. Price for what was ordered is a bit pricey. ,4
 The Stockyards has been around a long time but doesn't feel old at all. Great place to for any occasion. ,5
" It was near my hotel, was recommended for good food, and has been around a long time. The staff was very accommodating. The steaks and salads were quite goo, but not the best I've ever had. I tend to think it's over -priced, but it seems to be in the range of these places in Phoenix. I'm not particularly enthusiastic because it seemed too noisy for my taste. ",4
" My first visit to the Stockyards restaurant was for a business luncheon with a client who flew in -- so a place near the airport was a priority.  What a great surprise!  A traditional steakhouse in the middle of what looked to be an idustrial area.  Menu is varied with offering to suit any tummy and any wallet.  Wine list interesting by the bottle, a little limited by the glass.  Bartender is a very competent mixologist.  Service was terrific!  Enough attention to be sure we were attended to promptly, but not so much that staff was hovering.  We'll be back. ",4
 Rarely filled ice tea. All other service was good. Liver was dry and smokey few onions. Was no t told that casear salad was 5 dollas more to substitute for regular salad. ,3
 Exceptional service! ,4
" Two of the four of us had to send our steaks back as they were grossly overcooked.  The server obviously knew it was a business meal as he did nothing for our troubles, including not taking a penny off the bill or offering a complimentary dessert or drink.  If this is the best steakhouse in town, I feel bad for the Phoenix area. ",2
" How many 70 year old restaurants have you eaten at in the last year? There is a reason that the Stockyards has remained a mainstay for the dining crowd in Phoenix for so many years.  It isn't the name, it isn't the location (although neither are bad); its the food, the service and the atmosphere.  Having dined at the Stockyards as far back as '69, the food is always as good as you remember (a rarity), the service is five-star and then some and the surroundings rival the most hospitable locale you will ever be in.  Haven't been there? You can go without hesitation and you will not be disappointed.  Been there? You know what I mean. ",5
" Recommended by a local, took our meat-devouring Grandson there for a treat. He loved it, and so did we. Excellent, attentive and quick service; large, tasty portions; and not too ""ritzy"" an atmosphere. Would recommend it to anyone! ",5
 Wonderful.  Everything was the BEST.  Outstanding service. ,5
" I have been coming here for an annual holiday lunch with a friend for over 10 years now, and really enjoy it!  However, the prime rib dip was really fatty and soggy, and pretty bland.  You need to do a Bison burger again. ",4
 Finally after 17 years of hearing people talk about the Stock Yard I finally dined there. Now I wish I would have went sooner! Look forward to this place being on my must go to for dinner.....trying lunch next time I am in the area during the week. ,5
" I have only been here for lunch, and it had been a few years since I my last visit. That was due more to the location than any negative experience: I don't work or live anywhere near the restaurant any more.  The restaurant has that old steakhouse feel, and at lunchtime it was filled with business people conducting meetings. I suspect the number of lunch meetings contributed to the amount of noise I noticed during this visit, which was a quiet lunch meal with my wife for her birthday.   She had never been here, but it has been on her ""to do"" list for quite some time and we were driving through Phoenix on the way home. For lunch, she had the shaved prime rib dip sandwich and said it was one of the best she's had in Phoenix. I had the beef and cheddar on rye with steak soup to start. Also excellent, although it may be a little smaller than the dip. The steak soup was something I remembered from my last visit and had to get it again. The best way I can describe it is ""pot roast soup,"" complete with beef, veggies and gravy. I recommend it if you like pot roast. We both had fries, which were nothing special, but I'm not a big eater of fries anyway and should have ordered cole slaw.  Our service was excellent and everything was handled promptly. ",4
" On a scale of one to ten, I rate this restaurant a 15+.   Everything about our dining experience was over the top.  It was our 53rd anniversary and we were looking for someplace special - and we certainly found it~ The Stockyards! ",5
" Frank and Alberts is the middining venue at the Arizona Biltmore. Breakfast was wonderful....creative, healthy and filling.....great service at all meals. Dinner was good but very heavy traditional American fare....the bake potato with prime rib was so large i could only eat 1/4 of it. I expected a bit more creative and light cuisine. Traditional fare is steak, prime rib, pizza, and burgers....  Overall very pretty setting, great service, good food. ",4
" This was our second visit and it surpassed our first. Our servers were attentive, helpful and exceedingly competent. The food was delicious. My prime rib was prepared as requested. Acouple who joined us were also pleased and impressed by this restaurant. This is an outstanding choice for a quiet dinner with friends. ",5
" I love Frank and Alberts. The Arizona Biltmore Hotel is well complimented by this restaurant and the service, food, and atmosphere is always enjoyable. ",5
" The food is acceptable - run-of-the-mill ""comfort food"" as advertised. The service, however, was so poor as to be laughable. Entrees served without sides, drinks ordered but never served, and the wsiter gone for such long stretches that correction of the problems was impossible. Waited 20m for coffee, finally the manager appears, apologizes for the waiter's absence, following which the coffee appeared - absolutely ice cold! Our general experience with the entire Biltmore service was that for such a lovely and upscale resort, they have a ways to go with respect to training staff. ",1
" Good food, good service, nice surroundings what more could you ask for.  It is kind of pricy, but it is worth it for a special occasian. ",5
 Great filet cooked perfectly. Rare prime rib also perfect.  Cocktails made to order were tasty as well.  Service was attentive and friendly. ,5
" The hotel itself was spectacular. Clean, well maintained, elegant, first class, distinctive, a real show place reflectingAn historic era of u ique architecture. Thank you for preserving so beautifully. The grounds were spectacular.I was disapponted with the food at Frank and Albert's. The quality did not reflect the style and sophistication of the rest of the hotel. We couldn'tReserve in the dining-room as it is closed for lunch. My cob salad was fine, but nothing special. Food was spattered on menus. Not classy. ",3
 We enjoyed our visit.......so much to see and enjoy. We'll be back next year. ,5
 The food here is always wonderful. We had bad service for the first time so that was our only disappointment. ,3
 Been here many times. Never a disappointment. Fabulous late night service. Love the ambiance and fire pit. It's like going to grandma's house...but better! ,4
" Our mistake was dining there on Valentine's day. They were very busy, the service was extremely slow and the food was cool to luke warm. The special menu was very nice but too expensive. ",2
" Overall, was not that impressed. Food was good , but not exceptional. Dining room was very modern, service was good. ",3
 Beautiful fresh ingredients used well to maximize the taste of the dish. The baked beans are the best I've ever had. Even my very picky husband loved the food. ,5
 SO-SO ; Prime Rib sent back B/O being cold . Had to ask for check twice. Food was average at best . ,3
 The $7 dessert with four different parfaits was outstanding finish to a very good meal! ,4
" The food and service at Frank and Alberts was good per usual. However, before dinner, we wanted a cocktail and sat at Wright's bar for 15 minutes before being noticed by the wait staff. Recommend the restaurant - yes - recommend Wright's bar - not this time. ",4
 We enjoyed a quiet romantic evening. Service personel were attentive without being intrusive and the foood was outstanding. A definite keeper. ,5
 Great experience when you get the right server. ,4
 Excellent choice for Business lunch. ,4
 The restaurant is beautiful and the food is too! It was everything we hoped it would be and we would recommend Frank and Alberts as a perfect Phoenix experience all around. ,5
" Great service and food. Just avoid the pizza - it came on a disposable foil plate and looked like they'd just opened a frozen pizza box and served it. Otherwise, excellent meal. ",5
" Spectacular building- designed by Frank Lloyd Wright- with beautiful architectural details. Food was very good, but it was a bit noisy. ",5
" A favorite spot for lunch with friends...nice menu to chose from...fresh veggie flat bread, great chili, good tuna stuffed tomato salad...our choice this time. Sun room with seating around huge fireplace brings the outside in. All set in the historic Baltimore Hotel. ",4
 Frank &amp; Albert's is a wonderful place! Great food and ambiance!!! ,5
" Very classy, historic location. Worth the trip from anywhere in the valley. ",5
 The food was magnificent. My daughter and I loved the desert flat and the hummus with the baby carrots. Thank you for making our dining experience so enjoyable. We will definitely be back! ,4
" Located in the Frank Lloyd Wright designed Arizona Biltmore, the tour of the common spaces is worth the visit. Our lunch was fabulous, the service first class and the setting is hard to beat. ",5
" We were a group of 8 with two children. There was a good children's menu and nice crayons with a Frank Lloyd Wright design for them to color. The menu was varied so that health conscious members of the family had plenty of options, as did my step father who enjoyed his meatloaf (the best he has ever had). Everyone enjoyed the beautiful setting and the service. It was even nicer that we could all actually hear each other. We would definitely go back. ",4
" The food overall was not good. The pre fix menu selection was nice but the salad, steak &amp; dessert were the only good things on the dinner. The ""pretzel"" bread was undercooked &amp; doughy, the dipping sauce was terrible. The lobster bisque soup was bland &amp; extremely salty and fishy tasting with no sign of any lobster, tasted like boxed soup. The whipped potatoes were cold and almost runny, dripped through a fork, the string beans were very undercooked and the crab cake was very small, overcooked and had very little crab to it. 4 of my guest have been chef's &amp; two have owned retaurants with extensive retaurant experience, their thoughts were the same. We were very disapointed. The staff was great and extremly nice, service was very good. ",2
" We had a great experience! We were a group of 10 and they gave us a wonderful private room which meant we could all relax and enjoy ourselves (we had three children in our party.) The meals were all delicious. Excellent cocktails - we all ordered our favorites and they did a fine job with negroni, lemon drop and rob roy. New Year's Eve menu was really good and everyone was happy with their meal and the experience overall. I had to ask for a vegetable with my steak and potatoes which came on the plate without anything veggie at which I was a little shocked. :-) They promptly complied, but as we ate there a few times more during the week because we were staying at the hotel, I felt their menu needed more veggie options and variations. ",5
 The food and service are very good. Noise and comfort level not so good. We would return for the food. ,4
" We went for Christmas dinner ($45 pp) and were first timers for this restaurant. The food could not have been better, but the ambiance was lacking (small space, people walking through, no table cloth). This restaurant pretty much serves as the hotel's coffee shop and seemed to put those with reservations in an adjoining space with about 6-10 tables and a fireplace. I suppose we could have had more Christmas ambiance in Wright's (another restaurant at the AZ Biltmore hotel) at $85 pp, and should not have been surprised. ",3
" We had reservations for Christmas morning, so were quickly seated. Menu offerings were interesting, with the option of a complete brunch buffet. We enjoyed the menu choice of eggs Benedict with smoked pork loin and a chili chive hollandaise sauce. Service was attentive and informative, with a quiet ambiance. ",4
" Very disappointing! Food mediocre! Sad, as I have been going to the Biltmore for many years. I decided to try F &amp; A for Christmas Eve. Big mistake! ",2
 Fun. Loved making s'mores at the table. ,5
" We came here for an excuse to see the fabled BIltmore Hotel, and were not disappointed by the architectural details and landscaping that make this such a unique destination. Frank and Albert's was lovely, nice staff, colorful plates of food. Not crowded enough for them unfortunately. The kitchen could have reduced the large amount of colored corn chip strips in my chicken salad and added in more greens, say, napa cabbage and purple instead of the corn, but it was otherwise tasty and good portion for the smaller size I chose. It was nice to see duck fat option for your side of fries. Hubby and neighbor friend liked their dishes also. We would enjoy returning for happy hour to see the holiday lights while Xmas lights are still ",4
 Beautiful quiet and the best service ever! ,5
 Not very impressed with this restaurant. The food was so-so. ,2
" Very different kind of menu. I had the special prime rib, and it was excellent. ",4
 Just an ok place.....no one else there. ,3
" The place was not busy...however, I had ordered grilled vegetable plate and what I received was 'a quick flip on the grill' of one onion, 6 asparagus spears and three carrots....nothing else. I have to say that when my other 3 dining partners received their meals, I was handed a plate of steamed asparagus....and nothing more. Hmmmm, they got broccoli..somehow that didn't land on my plate. The waiter apologized and said there must have been miscommunication when he turned in the order. The other three said their salmon, pork chop and steak were 'just ok,' Not returning even though it was on our dining card. ",2
" My wife and I are NJ tourists who came to lunch after inspiration from seeing Frank Lloyd Wright work at Taliesin - they recommended seeing Biltmore. Design up to expectations, but good intentions masked poor follow-through. Cocktails arrived after lunch did. Food couldn't live up to menu description - chopped salad was pedestrian, would have been boring in the 80's. Servers were pleasant, but nobody minding the store. ",2
 Over priced for the quality of food. ,3
 Reception staff runs hot and cold.  Not very personable for such a customer-oriented position. ,3
" Food was very good, but not great. Service was outstanding as was the atmosphere. ",4
 I called ahead to make sure the bill was charged to my credit card. The woman who answers the phone took my card information but at the end of the evening my friend's husband paid the entire bill as he pulled the waiter aside before the bill came. I explained to the waiter that I had already arranged to pay the bill ahead to of time by calling and he just ignored what I said. We selected this restaurant since our friends have a four year old. We were initially seated by a large open fire display and when we asked to move to a booth were told that there wasn't a booth tht would fit our party. We had just passed multiple empty booths that would easily fit our party and were finally seated there grudgingly after my friend insisted. ,1
" Food was very good, outdoor seating scenic. Service only rated good because we were ignored by our own waitperson, who would be rated poor, but saved by two other staff members, who are rated excellent ",4
" Sevice rather inattentive. Food was average, nothing special. We were disappointed! ",2
 Lovely location inside the Arizona Biltmore. Our Thanksgiving dinner was quite good with traditional dishes. Service was organized and efficient for a busy holiday. ,5
" We came to Frank and Alberts for Thanksgiving dinner this year and loved it! Service was so-so (gave us the wrong dessert to take home, knocked a glass over and had us go to the museum on the 3rd floor that was closed) but the food was excellent. The only complaint that I had was the turkey was dry and unseasoned. Thankfully, everything else that was served was exceptional. This is a lovely restaurant that needs a little bit of help in the service department but I tip my hat to the chef. ",4
