"Have eaten here many times but for some reason this visit the service was fair. Waiters standing around and had to ask several times for bread, beverages, and coffee. Seems as though no one wanted to take responsibility in serving.",5
The food is as authentically Italian.  The server was efficient  and friendly.,5
Food was very good  service was great ,3
would recommend,5
The dining space was great. With an ambiance I did not expect. The dining staff were efficient and marked into the background however they were available at a glance. ,5
"The bar was cozy, well stocked and on this particular night populated  by a crowd of characters. ",5
I can't wait to return.,5
"Easy pre-theater. Northern Italian, not fancy but fast and consistent. For midtown it is a good choice for a quick business lunch with colleagues or a pre-theater meal.",5
Frequently eat here. Food is great! Service was good. Sometimes we get the same waiter.,5
Consistently delicious food. We were a party of four this time. We all ordered different entrees.  All of us extremely pleased with our selections. The service is impeccable. Wait staff and bar staff very friendly and courteous. The ambiance is very inviting.,5
Great food and service and 5 minute walk to Rockettes!,5
We had a reservation and were seated right away. Plenty of staff. Our waiter was very good. The food was mediocre. Tasted like everything came from a can.,5
After reading the reviews we were looking forward to a delicious dinner. The  overall service was deplorable. The waiter was rude to the point we almost left. This is the first time I have left a review but the experience was beyond disappointing and the food is mediocre at best.,5
Loved it a lot,5
We came Christmas Eve. Food was good and service was paced just right.,5
"Initial service was quick.  Waiter kept pishing us to order.  Appetizers came very quickly as did the main course, then service slowed.  Never offered a second drink during entire visit.  Food tasty, but not exceptional.  Convenient to theater district.",3
"As a Family of five staying in midtown, this was an an easy, casual dinner option. We booked ahead which means we didn’t need to wait ages for a table. No kids menu but ordered the tortellini soup which kids enjoyed. Chicken Fancese was ok, too lemony but not bad. Enjoyed the cozy atmosphere, comfortable seating and wine! Server was a bit gruff (stereotypical New York “attitude”) but we were so tired and hungry we didn’t care.",4
Christmas celebration,3
Excellent food. Everybody (15 persons) enjoyed their evening.,4
We had a reservation and got seated immediately even though the restaurant was packed because it was a Saturday night ten days before Christmas. The ambiance was wonderful and the food was absolutely delicious. I had the shrimp scampi and it was the best that I have ever had!!!,4
"We made reservations and arrived early. The hostess seated us within 3 minutes of arriving.  I asked the waiter is the fried calamari good, bc I’m very picky about my calamari. He said it was very good... and it was !  I also wanted to order the linguine frutta Di mare, again I asked, is it good. He replied excellent, and it was. I like my pasta a bit more al dente, and the large shrimp that came w the dish were a bit over cooked but overall the dish was very good and very tasty !! I would def go back !",5
Excellent choice for dinner. Had had the spaghetti with red clam sauce.....it was out of this world. I WOULD definitely go back!!,5
The service was great.  The waiters were attentive and very friendly.  But the food was just ok.  My husband and I had the salmon served over a chick pea salad which did not include any pasta and it was very good.  My kids had shrimp scampi and pasta with meatballs and they were just ok.  Ironic that the dishes without any pasta were the best ones.,5
Staff was wonderful. Waiter so attentive.  Great variety of food to choose from price wise which when with a group is great.  Pasta was delicious,5
We were able to dine on a Friday evening and not feel rushed! The food was delicious!,5
What a find!!! Just happened upon this restaurant and EVERYTHING was GREAT....,5
Our reservation was for 1PM and we were graciously seated at 1:01!!! WOW...,5
"I had the best chicken parm sandwich, my friend had the chicken francese that she described as scrumptious. My other friends had soup and salad that was REALLY GOOD...",4
The servers were so polite that I told the gentleman at the front door that the guys werE unbelievable...,4
JUST A FANTASTIC EXPERIENCE...THANX!!!!!,4
We WILL be back..........................................,4
"The food was delicious and the atmosphere was nice.  Unfortunately,  the wait staff was not the best.  I had no clue who my waiter.  I wasn’t greeted, and I was shuffled between two people.",2
Great food fast friendly service nice selection reasonably priced,3
"Everything we ordered was delicious: margarita pizza for appetizer was perfect! The fettuccini Alfredo w/chicken, peppers & peas - great flavors. My husband ordered the chicken Parmesan which was tasty too but he liked my fettuccini better ;) Our waiter was very attentive without rushing us - which is important to me. The Holiday music, the decorations, delicious meal, great service, great meal!",4
I go here whenever i visit the city. I love it...wait staff is as awesome as the food.,3
Week break in New York.... wanted different places to eat.  Found this place by accident when we cut down a street but ended up going back twice as the food was good and a reasonable price.,3
"The waiter basically ignored us and the order that he finally brought out was incorrect. He took forever to give us even a glass of water.  I remembered being in the restaurant previously and had a great experience, but not so much this time.  There are other restaurants in the  area to chose from next year.",1
If the three meals my chicken parmigiana was the best.  The pizza was good just not at that price.  Wine was good. Desert and coffee great,1
"It was a busy Saturday night.  We have 815 reservations but arrived a bit late due to a delayed train. Happy to find they held a table for us. It was all downhill from there.  Waited ten minutes just to get a menu. Another 15 after that before our order was taken.  All other tables were given bread baskets except for us and the table next to us.  Apparently they had forgotten until we asked. Food was good and the atmosphere was nice.  Bathrooms was extraordinary clean it’s too bad given the ample amounts of waitstaff and people bussing tables that they are so disorganized to the point where no one isbsjre who got drinks,menus or bread. But when the credit card was put down it was taken within 30 seconds... but a water refill I had to flag someone down.  Disappointing.  Maybe during non Christmas season they can handle the chaos better",5
"Busy holiday season- good things big we had a reservation! Food good, a little pricey for pasta",5
"We took our kids to see a broadway show so we wanted a place that had everything. Pizza, Pasta, chicken and more. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and would definitely go back should we be in the area again. It is a big place but the tables were nicely spaced and with high ceilings it wasn't too loud. My daughter had pizza and it was very good. My wife had a pasta dish and enjoyed hers as well. I had the chicken parm and was happy. It was all above average food and they cater to the theater crowd so we were in and out in under an hour. If you are going to the theater and need a place that has something for everyone adults and kids alike this is your place.",5
Good food and varied menu.  Pasta and pizza are very good and chicken dishes are tasty.,5
Chicken parmigiana was delicious,4
"Would have preferred fried mozzarella, rather the combination of mozzarella and ricotta",3
Wait staff was friendly and attentive,4
This is a good Italian restaurant just a few blocks from the hustle and bustle of time square. Food was really good the service was very quick and efficient. We brought our teen aged kids and they ordered the pizza which they enjoyed! My wife and I enjoyed our dishes as well! I would recommend for families and It wont break the budget!,3
Not family friendly - they didn’t even have sharing plates to use.  Food was 6/10 at best.  Seems like a tourist spot.   Pasta below expectation for an Italian place.  Very underwhelmed.,4
"Wait staff was very friendly and helpful. Got tricked in by the sign advertising half priced wine and appys only to find out with our bill that it was only ""in the bar""",4
"Overall great meal though, nothing fancy",4
Excellent choice for a quick tasty pre theater meal. Especially good for kids and groups. Enjoyed it very much.,4
Good pizza and lobster bisque soup. The main waiter was real grumpy and didn’t even offer water when we first sat down. And when we tried to get his attention his answer was “what,3
First time,5
"Loved my lunch - had heard about this restaurant for months.  Loved the casual yet very elegant and professional service, and great food.  It was the perfect spot for the meeting I had there.  I was very happy with everything about it.",5
Impeccable service and great and refined food yet simple. The best combination !,5
This is one of the great gastronomic gems of New York and consistently lives up to its own stellar level of experience.,5
Very high quality hand made pastas. Impressive menu with plenty of seafood options that are extremely fresh.,5
stellar in every possible way.  exquisitely delish.,5
Wow what a treat. It was my parents’ first Michelin and finest fine dining experience and they can’t stop talking about how perfect everything was. ,5
"Tami and the rest of the staff, front and back, were great. ",5
Thank you.,5
"Appetizers were tasty but half of them were minuscule and severely overpriced for the portion, the entree were tasteless and homemade pasta so average. The service was condescending, disinterested , never asking how was the food as an example of the lack of concern, even upon paying the bill there was disinterest as to how we liked the meal and experience.",3
"Such a beautiful place ! Great location! Delicious menu ! I had tuna , octopus and sea bass for my enter . Love it !!!",5
Good choice for seafood with reasonably priced selections on the wine list. Missing some of the presentation flair one might at some of the other marquis NYC restaurants.,4
Absolutely fabulous,5
Some of the best food I have ever eaten.,5
Our experience was fantastic. The restaurant was beautiful and the service was beyond exceptional. The food was fabulous. We have dined all over the world and it was definitely in our top favorite restaurants for dining.,5
"the noodle is a little salty, but the lobster is pretty good to try. good service as well",5
La verdad que una excelente opción para comer Frente al Central Park. Costo - benefició más que sobresaliente.,5
Súper recomendable para aquellos que piensen que esto es para unos pocos..,5
Visiting NYC fir a biz conference,5
As always the food and service are outstanding,5
"Marea is a stunning restaurant with truly amazing food and an impressive wine list! The service is some of the best you will experience in the city and  just steps from Central Park. Make a reservation, you’ll be glad you did!",5
"The food was absolutely amazing - pastas delicious as were appetizers.  If you want it to be ""affordable,"" need to watch what you order a bit... but absolutely doable.  Next time would request to be in the main room.  Great drinks - expensive wine though.  Definitely will put it on my special occasion/client dinner list... fab food.",5
"Amazing pasta, and they would do half the portion! Their Tiramisù version is to die for! The new appetizer they recently got on the menu - stuffed cabbage  - is amazingly delicious, all the ingredients go so well together. It’s a place where you want to come for  real food, not the pretentious presentation that so many famous restaurants are notorious for nowadays.",5
"The food was fantastic, living up to expectations, but the service was very disappointing particularly given the restaurant's reputation, to say nothing about the prices.  When we arrived at 5:30 for a pre-show dinner, there was an army of staff lined up near the entry and nearly every table was empty.  For some reason, however, it took over 10 minutes before anyone came to our table to ask if we would like a drink.  Our aloof server would have been adequate for a middle-of-the-road steak house, but her casual approach and inattentiveness was very disappointing for a Michelin star restaurant.  We informed the host when we arrived that we needed to leave for a show by 7:30, but found ourselves searching for the waitress at 7:20 to clear our entree plates and bring the check (we had to pass on the desert included in the prix fixe dinner). Time for Michelin to take another look at Marea.",5
Marea is consistently consistent as one of the top restaurants in NYC.,5
Another superb dinner and service.  We have celebrated here for our special occasions many times and never been disappointed.  This is one of the best in NYC.,5
Fantastic!!,5
Excellent!!,5
Amazing food. One of best restaurants that i have ever been too. Cant wait to come back.,3
Really good!,4
"Fabulous food,  immaculately presented Italian classics in a lovely elegant environment opposite Central Park. Certainly not a cheap night out but well worth it for a special occasion. Seafood amazing! Appetiser prawns, pasta and scallop mains were the highlight and the desserts fantastic. The fixed price 4 course menu is a perfect choice",1
Celebrating a promotion.,1
Always enjoy the vibes and the food at Marea - never had a bad meal.  The ambience is wonderful and the food is sublime - I will go back again and again!,5
"Arrived on time (8:45) - table isnt ready & it happens but it should come with a phony apology & an ETA. Stood around for 15 minutes, decided to ask for our coats so we can have a smoke outside so when inquiring about an ETA - it was met with disdain. This was all fine as I also work in F&B & deeply despise people. I still feel a better effort should be made to conceal such contempt & I try to work on it everyday with my staff. Though it was nice to see Michael White in the house on a Friday night.",5
"We both opted for the 4 course menu & we also decided to add two addt’l crudos, an order of crostini to start & a few langoustines with the main courses. Crudi & antipasti were beautiful. But the fusilli was having a bad day so I didnt touch it - which in turn coincided with the oddest lapse of service I’ve ever witnessed here. The dish sat in front of me for 25 minutes until George our server finally checked in. How many different employees walked by me and said nothing? Alot of runners, servers, sommeliers and guys in suits who check in on tables. No worries, it happens & George made things right. But it left a weird taste in my mouth because of the strange behavior of the host & Maitr’d. ",5
"The take away I always get from Marea is that it’s the type of place where you drop 7 or 8 hundo & you dont feel cheated on food. You just feel the difference between places like this & Le Bernadin. They are in a different stratosphere in terms of service. Marea has no class. You dont have to flag backwaiters for bread, they will serve you whatever glass type you prefer with the champagne & you will never feel like you are doing someone a favor. You will never sit with an untouched dish. You dont care about that stuff at Blue Ribbon - the expectation is set by the restaurant itself. I know diners have a sense of entightlement & that only grows when the spot is bearing two Michelin stars but this doesnt change the little things. The ones that add up and make it all worth while.",5
"What a disappointment.  We were sat down next to a piece of furniture that housed silverware.  The entire night the wait staff were opening and closing the draw and all we heard was the continual clanking of silverware.  The final straw came when the wait staff brought over a huge tray of silverware to put in the draw.  To top it off, there was an extremely bright lamp sitting on top which totally destroyed the mood.  The wait staff would linger and chat while they got the silverware for their tables. Ironically, we had to ask for silverware for our table.  When we complained to the general manager he was rude and had an attitude. First he acknowledged it wasn't a good table and we should have asked to move.  Really!!!!  When addressed again, he actually stated that people request our table.  (hehehe)  General Manager left such a bad taste that we will never return.  Great food, very poorly managed!!!!!!!!!!!!",4
Always perfect every visit — love the team here.,3
Loved everything about Marea. Had s great server named Elizabeth. Bonus was having Bono and the Edge sitting next to us!,4
The fusilli was excellent and The plate whith burrata was very very good!!!,3
"good service and excellent food, great fresh seafood and pasta, but prices very high and portions small.",5
This is one of the best restaurants in New York City. I try to go there for dinner every time I’m visiting New York City. Fabulous plus !,5
Food and service was not incredibly amazing than I expected.,5
Their risotto was too salty. I couldn’t even finish it. :(,4
Marea has it all going on - for a minute or two.  then it becomes glaringly obvious that one is paying immensely for modearetly good food.  Go to Le Bernardin!,5
"An off night for Marea.  Service was off and on attentive. First two courses served simultaneously instead of sequentially. Some food was only warm, not hot. bread choices were uninspired. one side item we ordered was forgotten. My fourth time here and I will give them another chance. but i was disappointed.",5
Solo me retrasaron una hora mi reserva,5
Good for date,5
"Food  was great, but service was okay. It was offensive our waiter started to clean the floor before we left the table.",5
Great service and the food was excellent.,4
Absolutely amazing food. The staff are extremely generous and kind to you. Everything was perfect. A little pricey but I was ready to pay a high bill before even getting there. By hey.. what do you expect for a high end steakhouse in the middle of NYC. ,5
Al in all 1000% worth it,5
"We went during restaurant week. Even though it was clear that we were not business men on an expense account we were treated as if we were.  The food was excellent and the service was spectacular. It was an exceptionally good value due to the restaurant week pricing, But there was a reasonable business man's lunch on the regular menu",5
This was my 7th time here but it was my best friends 1st time . She loved the decor all the way down to the dessert. We were at a great table with the best view of all the buildings along avenue of America’s (6th Avenue) including radio city music hall. Me and her booked our reservation through open table for restaurant week but when we arrived we were notified that we could not order food from the restaurant week prefix menu because it wasn’t available for dinner (only lunch). I was a little discouraged because that wasn’t explained on the website but our waitress managed to fix the minor issue and offer us something close to it. She was very nice & personable. We recieved a 3 course meal for $60 each (well worth it). We had Cesar and their house salad which had the most delicious avocado ranch dressing on it topped with a well done slab of cured brown sugar smoked bacon on it. We also had the salmon & fillet midallions with the famous Lobster mac and cheese for our main course. For the desert we had a creamy chocolate mousse and cheesecake that was to DIE FOR!! The service was phenomenal. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for 5 star quality service and delicious food. It is a little on the expensive side but it’s worth every penny. Thank you for making my best friends 1st experience here special. We’ll be back soon❤️,5
Absolute best as always,5
7 big guys and a cramped table upstairs in the corner by the window...only complaint! Management should’ve been able to help us out somehow...food and service were excellent!,3
"Service was awful!!!  Waitress kept claiming she was ""sick"".  Cut of filet mignon had fatty pieces and it was super small.    I would not recommend this place at all.",2
I have eaten here many times. Back in 2008 we had our sons graduation party after he finished his West Point degree.  Very special place for our family!  This time it was our 30th wedding anniversary!  Received a signed card from the staff ❤️ Can’t say enough good things about Del Frisco’s!! A must for every visit to NYC!!,3
"I always enjoy me meals at delfrisco, they have the best steak.  I took my friend there in honor of her retirement.  We had the best time ever.  My friend was really impressed and I'm sure she will return as i will.",5
"Overall, a wonderful experience, as usual!",3
"At Del Frisco’s, I look forward to the steaks. The steaks are  expertly cooked to your requested temperature. For Rib eyes, I recommend medium to caramelize the fat just a bit more or in general medium rare. The service was engaging but not intrusive. My water glass was never empty... Excellent. Thus is s must go to impress or to celebrate in style.",5
A good experience with restaurant week!,3
Mashed potatoes and cheese cake were delicious!,5
"For fellit steak, I think it's in normal standard.",5
The staff was professional and knowledgeable about the menu.  Great ambiance!,5
Celebrated birthday and watched the Superbowl.  Great table setting near bar area.  Waitress/staff very attentive.  Presented me with a beautiful and delicious birthday desert.  Thank you Del Frisco's.,5
One of our favorite restaurants! Ashley our waitress was excellent and spot on with her recommendations and service.  The only draw back was that the restaurants was very cold and we could've used a little heat.  Other than that zero complaints.,4
I have going to del frisco for the last 15 years..Love the steak and crab cake.,5
We ran a little late and they held the table for us even though we were about 5 minutes past their 15 minute grace period. They were quite busy but accommodated our late arrival and we were directed to their upstairs bar where we waited about 10 minutes before our table was ready. The cocktails were great and it was nice that there was a large TV upstairs. I made a reminder to myself to possibly return for their bar and bar menu during baseball season. ,5
"The service was spot on and the food was very good. We were not rushed to go through the courses and we were not pestered by over anxious waitstaff either. We had the bacon for an appetizer which we highly recommend if you like smoked meat. The wedge was nice, but what you would normally expect  but it was exactly what I wanted it to be; crisp lettuce, chunky blue cheese, and crunchy thick bacon. The onion rings were great, not too oily and they reheated nicely the next day. The cauliflower was good, but a touch too ""funky"" for me to go with the dry aged steak. Both our steaks were cooked perfectly to medium rare. The chocolate souffle at the end was overcooked and more of a flour-less chocolate cake than a souffle but was still tasty.  We brought our own bottle of wine for a $50 cork fee, which was great considering there are some competing restaurants in the city that do not allow outside bottles. Overall it was a fantastic experience and we will definitely be returning.",4
"I had made a reservation over a month ago for my boyfriends birthday. The food was very good but our seating area wasn’t. We were shoved back in a side room, away from the true ambiance of the Del Frisco experience, which made for a less than overwhelming experience.",5
"My visit was for a Special Occasion, this is not the spot for a Quiet Conversation or Romantic Evening.  We were seated close to the Bar side of the restaurant which could have been part of the problem , but the restaurant was aware that my reservation was for a special anniversary and could have seated us in a different section of the restaurant.  The restaurant did give us a Celebration Desert plate at N/C.",5
"Consistently one of the very best steak places in Manhattan.  The steaks for our party of four were perfectly cooked, tender, and well seasoned.  The sides were similarly outstanding.  Always a fun evening at DelFrisco’s.",5
"My boyfriend and I had an unbelievably amazing experience there on Saturday 2/3/2018. I can't wait to come back. The food, drinks, and service all exceeded our already high expectations. I can't celebrate the wait and kitchen staff enough. What a dream the whole experience was.",5
"Food was phenomenal, service was a bit stuffy. Great people watching view from the second floor",5
I brought my friend for her birthday.  ,5
Everything from ordering food to paying was a great experience. ,5
In my opinion I wouldn’t go any where else to have a superb steak dinner.,5
"Beautiful setting, delicious food, attentive and knowledgeable waiter!! A bit pricey but the total experience made it worth every penny! We mentioned that it was my sons birthday and the waiter surprised us with a birthday cake/dessert platter for him, big enough to share!! So sweet!",5
Great Steakhouse~Highly recommend!,5
Always great,5
The runner brought our bacon and prime rib to table next to us. When they carried plates. The back of plate touches the steak. Unacceptable.,4
"Great birthday experience, everything tasted amazing. Service by Sara was awesome.",1
"If you like steaks and/or seafood, this is your restaurant. The food is fantastic, the service is wonderful, the wine list is huge, and you’ll leave full and satisfied. Yes - it’s expensive...but - in my mind - worth the price.",2
"A very nice place. Let’s start off with they had our reservation and no waiting. We were seated right away with a nice view. Del Frisco is spacious so no one was on top of each other and me and my other was able to have a conversation. The bread was delicious crispy in the outside and soft on inside and hot. The butter was nice and fluffy. We ordered the oysters on half shell and king crab legs for appetizer, the wagyu tomahawk chops and Brussels sprout for dinner and chocolate soufflé cake, espresso double shot and tea.  The oyster and crab legs was fresh. The first problem was the wagyu tomahawk chop was crispy outside (nice) but when you cut into it there was way too much fat. We told the waiter (I think his name was Joel) he brought over one of the manager who saw how fat it was and offered another steak but by then we were a little turn off so they told us it would not be charge. We felt bad and wasn’t trying not to pay so we decided to order a dessert. Problem number two was the dessert came and no espresso or tea till after the dessert was done. We found the dessert dry like it had been sitting a while because the molten chocolate had already dried into the cake and wasn’t flowing any chocolate from the middle. But Joel was nice enough to get the dessert, espresso and tea taken off also. So not the best on the food this time but the service was great and really nice of them to take off the bill everything that was not great. The bill came to about $135 and we gave Joel a $65 tip for trying. We definitely will be back to try something else and hopefully it will be better and get to pay the entire bill. Thank DelFriscos for the great service and see you soon!",1
"My experience whenever I go to Del Frisco’s is beyond amazing. Their service is amazing, their food is amazing. Everything about them is just amazing! I’m always raving to my friends about them how great this place is.",2
"Attentive service, exceptional food and warm hospitable staff.",5
"Overall the experience was fun, but not the best Restaurant Week pick--though that's mostly on me. The menu was very slim with two salads offered as options for starters along with a lobster bisque. You could ""upgrade"" your meal for an extra cost to get a steak or something similar, but if you're going for the Del Frisco's experience via Restaurant Week, I would recommend against it. With that said, the French Dip was delicious with a wonderfully doughy baguette and an ample amount of meat. The fries were nicely crisp and salty. The lobster bisque had a good amount of lobster meat, but I was disappointed at the Caesar salads my friends ordered as they were bare and boring. All in all, I won't return to Del Frisco's during Restaurant Week, but I would to dine on their full menu.",5
Grilled octopus was excellent.,5
"Apps were good, not great.",5
Filet mignon small but very good,5
Desserts were outstanding ,5
Waiter and staff very friendly.,5
"the best ! great value during resto week, amazing staff ! love the food !",5
Excellent food and settings,4
"An outstanding lunch, as always. There is nothing too exotic on the menu but the food is cooked to perfection. It is not an inexpensive place so reserve it for a special occasion. But you will not be disappointed.",5
Everything was good except for the temperature in the dining room. It was very cold. Once the heat was on it was too hot and then it was shut down to cold again. It made my experience very uncomfortable. There were tables next to us eating dinner with their coats on. It looked like they couldn’t regulate the temperature steady.,5
Great ambiance great food,3
"Inattentive waiter. Had to wait for a cocktail. Food was delicious. Cost on the high side . Good for a special occasion, too pricey for  regular dining.",5
"The food we ordered was very good as was the service, looking forward  to returning soon.",3
"I had read mixed reviews so I entered with trepidation.  My experience, however, was solid.  Very good service - attentive.  The food was also very good and ample.  I could not finish what I ordered - neither could the table to my left.  I also came there to check out the dancing.  The dance floor was busy to full so that did not quite work out for us this time.  Maybe next time.  Good vibes.",4
"Fresh & delicious. We all ordered the same salads, with variations & Enjoyed them",5
Always fresh. Staff... service w/a Smile,4
First time here and will return. Food & Service were excellent!,5
"Second time going to Hendricks tavern , completely disappointed the service was not good , the food was over cooked the steak was burnt . , the noise level was obnoxious..having other customer yelling at the top of there lungs not professional at all.",3
"In the past we have enjoyed our meals at Hendrick's, it has always been cozy, with good food and cozy, however, this time we were left wondering why we chose this restaurant out of the multitude of those available in the area.  The food was mediocre, overpriced for what it was and the service was horrible.  ",3
"Upon arriving we were told that our table was ready, however, we could enjoy a drink at the bar and sit when we were ready.  We ordered a drink and then were seated.  Half an hour went by, our drink glasses were long since empty, and our waiter had still not made an appearance despite there being many around. We and our friends had a good laugh that our water glasses were kept wet, but our wine glasses were dry. Finally, we asked one of the men filling water glasses if we could order another drink. He seemed stunned that our waiter had not yet appeared.  When our waiter came to our table he seemed high. We asked for the wine menu and were given a cocktail menu, he commented on his dirty jacket. We finally were given the wine menu and the dinner menu.  We ordered food, which took a while because he couldn't seem to understand that we wanted one rib eye and one porterhouse, not two porterhouses or a porterhouse and the Tomahawk steak and it was a process. The calamari was ok though the breeding was falling off and the sauce was lackluster, the crab cakes were mushy and when our steaks came, we noticed that they were overcooked and the marrow bones that were served with them had nothing on which to spread it or little spoons to eat it; we would have used the bread that is usually refilled at the table, but the basket was empty and remained empty. The desserts tasted as if they had been and were still frozen. The bill was sizable and the food was poor, but the company was good or we would have been even more disappointed.  Had the food and service been better, we would have continued to patronize Hendrick's and headed to the bar instead of going elsewhere.",1
This was not our first visit.,5
Always a pleasant time.,4
The food is always excellent. The vibe is lively and fun. Service is very good. ,4
"Hendrick's has its ""formula"" which is executed perfectly every night.",4
Glad it's in my neighborhood!,4
"received our group of 10 very well. service was good, drinks were made well. we ordered steak medium well, and it was well. so definitely order down a level if you like the steak on the less cooked side. parking attendant was a little sloppy, but overall great experience. will go back again next year.",5
"Table by the bar very noisy and constant walking back and forth. Fried calamari under cooked and unable to chew, lobster mac and cheese not worth the $26 fishy smell. Notified prior to arrival it was for my daughters birthday and was not accommodated!",5
Overall it was good but our table for 2 was sandwiched in between tables for six or more and the noise level made it hard to have a discussion,4
"Excellent, very good",5
Service was excellent surroundings were beautiful the ribeye steak with marrow bones were out-of-this-world and cooked to perfection it was absolutely excellent,5
We enjoyed a wonderful birthday dinner with friends...,5
4 happy customers.....,5
We will be back,5
"Waiter that had our table was curt and almost rude.  We had never been there before and had several questions about the menu.  When I asked what burnt broccoli was, or how it was prepared, he said, ""burnt.""  Regarding the lobster rice - ""it's chinese rice with lobster.""  It's a regular baked potato.  Filet had option of toppings, forgot to order, nor did he ask, so when I called him to the table his response was, ""Well it was on the menu.""  We were ready to get up and leave.  Asked for bread four times before it was brought well into our meal.  Food quality was good enough but not worth the $48 for each filet mignon  Dinner was expensive and didn't realize brunch was served until 3:30 pm.  Guess our waiter needed a break in-between.  There was a young lady who was gracious at one point and another waiter who at least presented with a smile.  Would never, ever go there again.",5
"Fantastic food, great service but pricey but worth it for special occasion",5
I’ve had chaotic nights at this place but this wasn’t one of them. Light traffic created good service. Saturday nights there is usually a frustrating experience.,5
Excellent dinner.  Everything was perfect. We all enjoyed bobs birthday party. Wonderful service.  Our table was perfect,5
The steaks could have been hotter.  Instead they came luke warm.  The service was impeccable,4
"My girlfriends and I came for a holidays dinner. The food, drinks and service were great.",5
"My family and I dined here on Saturday night, 12/23/17.  We had a reservation for 6, and were seated promptly.  Our server, Roy, was very pleasant and attentive.  Even though the restaurant was very busy, we were able to carry on a conversation without shouting.  I would return for another special occasion.  By the way, the coconut layer cake for dessert is super good!",4
"Consistently good food and good service! Always have an enjoyable experience. Have been for brunch, lunch and dinners-  and been pleased with all.  Would recommend for all",2
"From start to finish dining at Hendrick's was superb. It is a bit on the expensive side but well worth it. The food preparation is outstanding, the wait staff is very accommodating and the ambience is just perfect. One of my favorite restaurants on Long Island.",2
I keep trying Hendrick's and am disappointed each and ever time. First off BAD service...high prices AND BAD service..makes no sense. Went for lunch and ordered a steak sandwich..asked for it med-rare and it was raw! Took forever for our coffee to arrive..servers inattentive...bad choice!,2
Great Place to visit for special occasion. Will visit again soon,1
The best brunch menu on the North Shore.  ,2
Increasingly becoming our favorite local restaurant.,4
"Made reservations in October for December 8 . When my party of 3 got there we had to wait for an hour which was extremely rude, after all what’s the purpose of a reservations! I was extremely embarrassed and disappointed",1
"Excellent food, Excellent Service, and Wonderful old inn atmosphere. Highly recommended.",2
Food was very good but service was rushed.  Salad served just when cocktails arrived and main course came before we were done with salad.  A two hundred dollar meal for two should not feel rushed.,5
"Excellent service and food was great...everyone had a great meal, whether it was the fresh sea scallops, lobster cocktail or filet...always good. Our server Diego noticed we tried to put ice in a drink with a fork and immediately came over with a glass of ice and a spoon...impressed!",4
"Was over-priced for the quality of the food we had (beef short rib, signature chicken dish and fried calamari)",5
Good was delish. Our waiter was very friendly and accommodating.,4
Excellent wine list and service was great! Valet parking made it a breeze as well since parking in  Roslyn can sometimes be difficult. Had the Tuna tartar which was great!,5
"Every time I go there, it's awesome! We tried the white pizza last night - OMG! MUST HAVE! (Get one to share for the table - appetizer)",4
And if you really want to blow your diet - the sticky bun is out of this world. Shrimp cocktail was delish and so was the octopus. The staff was beyond friendly and it just has a very pleasant atmosphere.,4
I go there often and will continue to  - it's my new gem!,4
My favorite go to place.  I always feel special as soon as I walk in.  The food and service make you feel even better.,4
The Poll brothers always or perfection when it comes  to the restaurants and Hendricks Tavern is nothing less than perfection. Always a great meal weather dinner or brunch,4
Great!,4
As a pre-theater dinner experience we were delighted!,5
Very attentive wait staff. Couldn't have asked for a better evening!,5
"Like Arnold, ""we'll be back""!",4
"Good food, but a bit too pricey. Steak was great, nothing special about the skillet potatoes and onions or the creme brulee. On main floor of restaurant it's hustle and bustle but in the back room it is quiet and extremely dark. Good for privacy.",4
"I have eaten in this local restaurant a few times, the food and wine is excellent.",4
"Great location, Great Food, Great Service, and Great Management. A wonderful dining experience. Many thanks to Chris (Manager), James (Asst. Manager), Andrea and Chris (Servers)",5
You need to request to see the price fix theatre dinner menu. It was excellent value. Waiters were very attentive. This was my second visit and plan on making a third visit within the next three months.,5
Pricy but service is excellent. Ordered ribeye pink and it was over done which is surprising since this is a steak house.,4
just to say that the steaks are not as good as they should be regarding the price!!!,5
Had the filet. It was unbelievably tender. The potatoes au gratin are to die for. Fantastic restaurant. Would definitely go back.,5
In a word...TERRIBLE.,5
Got called for my table at 1045. I was already seated at a high top.,5
Girl who checked me in was rude and didn't care,5
always a great spot. service very good. restaurant very busy but we were seated immediately,5
"Great food, ambience and service. Server was extremely knowlegable and honest regarding everything from wines to apps to entrees. Bone in rib eye was as tender as a filet and very flavorful. Excellent experience.",3
Very impressed with this steakhouse! Amazing food and amazing service!,3
"We go here often, it is our favorite steak house",5
Food and service were excellent!,2
"This restaurant is awesome. It is as good as advertised. I first heard about Del Frisco's while reading an upscale lifestyle magazine a few years back. I finally got a chance to go, and it was well worth the wait.",4
"The wait staff was outstanding, the food was perfect and we had a blast. The place wa packed and we were treated like the only people there.",3
"Quite honestly the best steak I've ever eaten. Wine list and dessert menus were amazing. It was a great date night with friends. Wait staff is very knowledgeable and courteous. Somelier was very busy, and didn't arrive in time for us to select a bottle of wine. That said, there is a great list of suggestions in the front of the wine menu.",5
"Del Frisco's has the best steak in New York, quite possibly in the country. I don't think that I've had better steak and I've been to Luger's, Sparks, Mark Joseph's, Metropolitan Grill (Seattle), Morton's, Smith & Wollensky's, Gibson's (Chicago), Chicago Chop House, Lawry's, Daniel's Broiler, etc.",4
"A wonderful dining experience, great food, excellent service and a view looking out at 6th Avenue and Radio City Music Hall. It’s a steakhouse and they cook steak to perfection. Ask for a table on the second floor if you can for a great view.",5
"ALWAYS MY BEST MEAL IN NEW YORK CITY! PERFECT LOCATION, PERFECT SERVICE",1
AND ALWAYS A GREAT ATMOSPHERE THAT REFLECTS A GREAT CITY!,2
"We had 7:00 reservations,very loud, uncomfortably so.It did quiet down later.We sat downstairs. No corkage, we ask the manager to reconsider,because we brought a special bottle with us, but no.  They tried to make it up to us, with a free dessert.  Overall, very good ! We especially like the 3 smaller filets with different sauces.Service was excellent.",4
"Perfect place for a great steak before a show. Four of us dined there before the Peter Gabriel concert at Radio City. I booked via open table, was seated promptly and the waitstaff took very good care of us. When we told them we were on a timeline, they responded perfectly and had us on our way right on time. The steak we ordered, Filet Mignon and Porterhouse received rave reviews as did the salmon one person ordered. All the sides were good, but the creamed spinach was the best. Del Frisco's is my favorite steak place in NY. While it can be expensive its well worth it.",4
"'ve eaten some good steak and this place served me one of the best bone-in-ribeyes I have ever eaten. Service was excellent and the ""chateau potatoes"" were very tasty (spicy mashed potatoes). We went early to catch a Broadway show and sat downstairs which seemed a bit cavernous. Might be better later at night when it is dark and you can see out the huge windows. By the time we left at 1815 the bar area was packed and the dining room was just starting to get busy.",4
It was really good. The food was delicious.,4
I've been here several times and the food is always excellent and the waitresses are always beautiful!,5
This is my favorite Manhattan steakhouse.,5
"Had a excellent meal, fun atmosphere. Service was great - our server Jenn did a wonderful job. Good wine advice from the sommelier. Would recommend this restaurant for business dinners or a special occasion.",5
WONDERFUL DINING EXPERIENCE! LOVED IT! WILL DEFINITELY RETURN!,5
"The best filet I've ever eaten. The waitress, Amber, was friendly, made great suggestions (especially the to die for signature cocktail), and was extremely professional. I can't wait to go back.",4
"Overall, Del Frisco's is a great steakhouse. I love the Midtown location, really convenient to the Theatre District and shopping, My only issue, which is not unique to Del Frisco's, is the lack of creativity in appetizers and sides. Steakhouses focus on their meat entrees, and while the appetizers and sides are good; they are just not innovative or unique. A great place to grab s bite when in Midtown. Remember to ask to be seated upstairs, the view is best from there.",5
"We usually go to Keen's for great steak but wanted to try something new. DelFrisco's is a chain restaurant, and it came across that way. We went for dinner and people were dressed in sweatpants and kids were playing portable nintendo at a table. 10 oz filet mignon was ok, but definitely have had better. It was very noisey and the tables were crammed together on the upper level seating area. Not as expensive as Keen's, but left feeling a bit confused about why people rave about the place. Would not go again because it really does not have the ambiance or the food I was expecting from a steakhouse.",5
"Food was mediocre, not cooked as ordered. Non-stop upselling to get you to order the most expensive items on the menu and constant over-praising of the mediocre food made the whole evening one we wished we had skipped. Only highlight was the onion rings.",4
"We took my daughter here for her 14th birthday. We all enjoyed our meals immensely. The waiter was great. We all ordered some sort of steak and they were all cooked to perfection. I would rate this as our favorite steak house. We are pleased that they have opened one up in Boston, a lot closer to home and may go for a special occasion as it is very pricey.",5
As usual this restaurant goes beyond expectations. Food is excellent as is the service. Always look forward to dining here.,5
Everything was excellent!,5
Crab cake was to die for and steak is among the best in the city. Definitely want to come back.,5
"Unaceptable waiter ignored us, our steaks were not cooked to order. Felt rushed at the end when the check came the waiter of coarse stood by to make sure he recived his tip. Will never go again and will not recommend.",5
The food was very good. The service was exceptional.,5
"I would have preferred a nicer table but felt we were not given the table requested because we used ""Open Table"" reservations",5
Probably the best Rib Eye steak I have ever had. It was cooked to perfection.,5
"Overall dining experience was slightly above average, for a ""fine dining"" mucho expensive venue. The wait staff provided excellent service, e.g, they assisted with scooping side orders to our individual plates!",5
Very nice interior. The noise level was more on the noisy and loud side rather than vibrant and energetic.,5
"I ordered the filet mignon. One of the worse steaks I had at a ""fine dining"" restuarant. My fiance ordered the tuna. It was average. One of our friends ordered the prime rib, it was also average.",5
Fabulous. Dishes were imaginative and delicious . Service friendly and attentive. Glad to see they’ve switched to Open Table from Resy.,5
It's hard to find a good restaurant in the Hamptons -- especially off season.  This one was a pleasant surprise.  We all had different entrees and everyone agreed how great the food was.  My  new favorite place.  Food was just wonderful.,5
"First time there and we will be back.  Delicious food- entrees we had were the Spaghetti with shrimp, Lamb T-bone and Mushroom bolognese.  Appetizers also very good but on the small side.  Ask for bread- it is great.  Service excellent.",5
Such a special place. We love coming to this resto.,5
"Went New Year’s Eve, it was very quiet. Food was delicious and the service excellent. ",5
"I had the ribs and a side of fries. Ribs were tender, not over sauced, fell off the bone. Fries were outstanding. Crinkle cut,  poked crispy and had a seasoned rub on them, no ketchup needed. ",5
"My wife had the parsnip soup and she raved. Then she had some yummy energy greens little heavy on the garlic and the Bar Thai shrimp, lightly fried and very very tasty. ",5
Only disappointment was the measured tequila on the rocks. A little heavier pour might have made the price seem fairer. Next time I’ll pregame....😀,5
We were delighted with our dinner on New Year's Eve.  The food was delicious and it came piping hot - on a freezing winter evening - that was a real treat!  The service was excellent...,4
The lights were a bit too bright and I asked our waiter to turn them down a bit and he  pleasantly agreed.,4
We'll be back for sure ,4
Best,3
Joan,5
"I highly recommend this restaurant. The food was wonderful, from preparation to presentation. Our server was knowledgable about the menu, very attentive and responsive. The atmosphere is open and friendly.",5
"Perhaps the idea of a restaurant affiliated with Vine Street Cafe built our expectations up too high, but Cove Hollow doesn't measure up to Vine Street in any way. The venue is attractive and the server was friendly but the menu was limited, overpriced for what it was and not the same quality as Vine Street. Neither beer and burgers nor fine dining, it's caught in between and suffers for it. We love the location and the idea of casual, fun dining in the midst of the overpriced, overhyped Hamptons but this concept needs some tweaking. That said, there's potential and we dearly hope it course corrects and makes it.",5
"I was looking forward to a warm and cozy experience, since it was my first time to the restaurant and I heard such lovely things about it. ",5
"Here’s the Bad...Upon entry, we found the maître d’ was not friendly and the atmosphere Boring, lacking in any ambience or originality. There was  a great rowboat mounted on the wall but no art, no music, no flowers and no life.  Our table for two was adjacent to another couple and we could hear each other’s entire conversations. The tables lack privacy and no acoustics to absorb the noise. ",5
Here’s the Good...Our waiter was nice and the potato crusted black Seabass was good.,4
"DELICIOUS, FRESH FOOD, PERFECT USE OF SPICES, FRIENDLY AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICE, ",5
GREAT CHOICES. WONDERFUL ADDITION TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD.,4
Vine Street owners have done it again- great food and warm setting,5
It is a nice place with elevated tavern cuisine the dinner was delicious.  The bar was quiet but friendly bartender who guided us with great dinner direction.,3
"Max Fish always delivers with fresh, delicious fish and seafood dishes served with creativity, flavor and style. ",5
"The wait staff and management are friendly, welcoming and accommodating.",5
"I make an effort to have dinner at MaxFish at least once a month for over a year now, and I have always been delighted that I chose to have my dinner here!",5
Lunch was very good. Service was excellent. I tend to gravitate to any Max restaurant. I am guaranteed a great meal and service.,5
"Delicious meal with extras from the waiter.  When we arrived, the waiter was very friendly and brought over a mini smoothie for us to try and then dropped off some little cinnamon dough bites.  The food came out quickly and was delicious.  My only complaint for the day were the bartenders at the Bloody Mary bar.  They had zero personality and were not friendly at all.",5
Great Bloody Mary bar and amazing brunch options!!!,5
Service was fantastic... Food was great w exception of the 2 lobster pan dishes.. both lobsters were overcooked. No other complaints... Would go back again,5
"Max Fish lives up the the reputation of the Max Group.  Excellent menu choices that are prepared wonderfully, and plated to please the eye and palate alike.  Seasonal add-ins and add-ons are welcome.  Have never been critical of a Max Fish experience or of any Max experience.  Excellent food group.  Service also top notch and servers very knowledgeable.",5
"excellent service, food, beer and wine. Food not only was delicious, but beautifully presented. Wait staff was outstanding.",5
"Enjoyed the meal at Max Fish. Great food, great service, great pricing for an upscale experience.",5
Food was good. Server was very polite.,4
"Very disappointed. Service was slow, never got the appetizer that was ordered and to our",5
"dismay, it took our waiter 3 times to get our checks correct and it was still not right. ",5
Over priced for what we got.,5
I was expecting so much more. ,5
"   I am speaking just for my meal of a lobster roll. I did not want the Cajun Remoulade so had it just buttered. Scant butter, flavorless lobster.  I got tartar sauce which was overpowered with onions or shallots. And I love raw onions. French fries were hot and delicious. ",5
"   Our table was a round one for 6, pushed so closely into the corner that 2 people always had to get out of their seats to let the 2 in the corner up for more Bloodys and to use the bathroom.  ",4
  The physical atmosphere is attractive but rambling and circuitous. I thought it poorly designed and arranged. We were far the Bloody Bar. ,4
"    We had a delightful waitress. Other staff did not smile - and I'm talking about the men in long aprons who appeared to be waiting to do something, like serve or bus. Those at the Bloody Mary Bar seemed to be unengaged - No acknowledgements, no smiles, no offers to advise.  And the shrimp on offer with the drinks were awful. Overmarinated, overcooked, tasteless.  ",5
   So the worst food offerings I had were seafood. ,3
   I have been to Max Burger and Max Oyster many times and love them. Their Glastonbury sibling not very much.,5
"Food was excellent, however the service was terrible.  It took 20 minutes for one beer to arrive, and upon requesting a refill of the house wine for 2 glasses, the server forgot and after 15 minutes we had to remind her.  Our appetizers all appeared at once - oysters, smoked octopus, clams and soup.  We sent the soup back, and felt extremely rushed.  However, food was excellent - we just wished we could take our time.  Upon receipt of the bill, we were still charged for the soup we sent back.",4
Overall disappointing due to the service.,5
Very nice meal and attentive service.,5
"We celebrated our son's getting his first job as a professional out of college here.  Everyone's food was wonderful.  I ordered the grilled lobster but it was tough.  I got another order of it and it was better but still not to my liking.  Nevertheless, I was taken care of, offered some shrimp cocktail, and didn't have to pay for that order.  The management was caring and concerned as well as apologetic.  I think it was just me and what I expected and prefer. I wouldn't fault them in the least.  I'd still go back!  ",5
The fish dishes were superb.  The lobster bisque out of this world.  We were seated immediately and on time since we had a reservation.  I liked all that.,5
"Food was outstanding.  Fresh, tasty, all our meals were top-notch.  Our server Michael (71) was on the ball.  Knowledgeable about the raw bar and gave great recommendations for the mussels.  Couldn’t have had a better, delicious meal.",5
Terrible service,5
"Fabulous food, especially their seafood.   The service was great and our family party of six  thoroughly enjoyed the meal.",5
"Food was bland, cafeteria level food and no effort at presentation. Service boardered on rude.",5
"Haddock dish had everything puréed. I don’t want a dish of baby food. As a dentist, I like chewing my food",5
Awesome experience. The staff was great. Our server was phenomenal. He knowledge of the menu and her enthusiasm made the experience that much better. I would highly recommend this restaurant.,5
"I used Open table to make a reservation the day before.  6 hours before our reservation, I changed it from 2 to 4 people.  When we arrived, they only had the reservation for 2 and told us we couldn't be seated.  The hostess was frustrated that I didn't call and relied on Open Table.  I told her the website directed me to use it.  She finally found us a table and the food and service was fabulous!  I was made to feel I made a mistake when I felt their website was misleading.  I will now call ahead to verify.",4
"The food was amazing. My friends and I had a lovely dinner. However, a bit disappointed it took awhile to seat us and then they were out of a few starter options we really wanted to try. Overall, it was delicious and the service was  adequate.",5
It was amazing! Great server and food!,5
"You can't go wrong with Max Fish for fresh fish, oysters, and an upbeat atmosphere.  They have a big selection of dishes (both main dishes and small plates) and have plenty of menu selections for carnivores (including great steaks).  The 4-6 and after 9 pm happy hours are good deals, and they have an excellent wine list, plenty of quality wines by the glass, and very interesting cocktails which change with the season.  It's a popular local spot, so get there early for the 4pm happy hour and important to book a table, particularly on the weekend.  Their fish and chips are the best on the East Coast.",3
"I took the love of my life to Max Fish tonight for his birthday. Reservations were at 5:30 and the table was ready for us the moment we walked in. The food was very, very good and the service was exceptional. Not long ago, I commented to Lou that I never see servers crumb down the table anymore, but everyone at Max Fish did. Our server, Michael, could not have been better. He read us, and what we wanted from our dining experience, perfectly, and was very personable. We never felt rushed but were also never neglected. He was there to take our orders, refill glasses, and clear finished plates with perfect timing. Michael also made great recommendations and we were both extremely satisfied with everything from the appetizers and soup/salad, to entrees to meals and desserts (mostly chosen from that evening’s specials). Last year’s birthday meal in West Hartford was such a disaster that despite living in West Hartford, we chose to drive out to Glastonbury to try Max Fish tonight. It was a great decision, and we can’t wait to come back!",3
"Truly, Max Fish is a treat. I have eaten at many fine restaraunts all over the North East and this place is on the very top of my short list.",1
Nice. Ugh with hubby.,1
The food and service were very good.  I appreciate the creative cuisine.,3
Our waitress was very knowledgeable about wine and the menu items. She was great when we needed to settle the check quickly and was kind enough to split the bill for us. I would definitely return and tell my friends to check it out.,4
Delicious as usual. Everything is always fresh and perfectly cooked.,5
As always everything was outstanding. We especially appreciated the service by Cheryl. She was very attentive at the same time didn't hover. All four dinners were excellent.,2
"went for New Years day with my three boys and husband had a great time- great server, food and experience.",5
"Excellent food and service, as always!! We typically go here for brunch and are never disappointed!",3
Great New Year’s Eve experience! Selena was wonderful.,1
"The food and service are always very good at any of the Max Group of restaurants. Last New Years Eve was exceptional, this year was only very good.",3
"Excellent fish, very crowded and sides were not appetising and were of poor quality. Ambiance and service was good. Crowded seating.",5
An awesome New Year's Eve dinner at Max Fish as expected.  They always do a great job from service to selection to presentation.  Kudos to everyone there.,5
New Year’s Eve!,5
Very nice atmosphere and excellent food! Will go back again!!,5
"I met a friend for a birthday lunch on New Year’s eve day. The food was scrumptious, the service excellent. Our waitress was very friendly and competent.",3
"Temperature too cold to be comfortable. The fried calamari was ok, too tough and not crispy enough. The trout and red snapper were very good, but over priced.",4
Awesome Dinner as always!!! Owner is always there and a great host!!!!!!,2
Hidden Gem with the freshest seafood and personal attention from the owner. Also one of the few places you can still byob.,4
Amazing seafood in a really casual but fun environment. Owner was very kind.  And the wine he selected for us was perfect!,3
Will go back for great seafood.,5
"Always a great option.  The seafood is good and fresh, the staff is warm and welcoming.  They are always accommodating.  This is our goto place for seafood.",5
"Hadn't been here in about 10 years, don't know why. Food was very good; highly recommend the octopus salad, red snapper, and swordfish. Service quite friendly. Only complaint: A little light on portion size of vegetables.",5
We were only people in the restaurant so service was excellent. Fish tacos were delicious as was octopus. Fish always fresh.,5
Favorite spot the the best seafood around! Don't miss the house made key lime pie!,5
We had a wonderful dinner at Conte’s.  The seafood is always pristine.  If you want great fish in a casual setting with a fair corkage policy there is no better choice.,4
The fish was well prepared and outstanding. The atmosphere was inviting and fun. The only negitve I can think of is the side dishes with the main course need a little bit of improvement.,4
"Delightful small place, artfully decorated, friendly and attentive service.  Fresh fish creatively yet simply prepared. Had trout on cedar plank with a kiss of horseradish/butter flavor...outstanding. Their cole slaw is delicious. Wine and beer only. Thumbs up!",5
"Hidden gem of a restaurant.  A truly unique dining experience in that it is a fish market during the day and a small intimate restaurant at night.  Owners are hands on and take great pride in their product.  The wait staff is knowledgeable and efficient.  The freshest seafood on the planet that is simply prepared.  You can bring your own bottle with a minimal corkage fee or order from the wine list.  Desserts are excellent and the price is beyond reasonable.  In short,  go there and you will thank me.",5
Amazing place to eat !!! Freshest and most delicious fish I've had in a while. Everything cooked perfectly. I'm picky so that says a lot! Staff and owner very friendly. A neighborhood gem ! Will definitely be back,5
"Restaurant was empty so we were immediately seated.  It definitely feels more like a fish market than a restaurant.  We quickly noticed that there was no A/C and the room was uncomfortable.  Since the crab cake had been recommended to me by a friend, we asked for 2 crab cake dinners to go as it was too hot.  The A/C was immediately turned on and we were encouraged, by our waiter, to stay.  Waiter was very attentive.  We did receive crab cakes with a side of green/yellowing broccoli, no potato/rice/etc.  I see now that a potato is $6 extra though this was not explained nor offered.  The crab cakes were small and plate was $22.  Crab cakes were, at best, average.  It seemed more like an appetizer portion.  I would stick to the fish market and buy something to make at home.",4
"I was immediately turned off by the sticky glass fish shaped plates that were on the table for the cole slaw. We ate out of the cole slaw serving plate instead.  Cole slaw tasted ok but the color was off and I was a bit worried.  Dinner and one drink each cost my husband and I $100. I think that's a lot considering the surroundings. After all, we were sitting in a fish store, right in front of the casements.  Food tasted ok, really just ok. We did unfortunately have some 'rubblings' afterwards.",5
"Always great seafood in a friendly, comfortable setting!",4
"This is a hidden gem that we have been coming to for years. A Seafood market by day and a restaurant at night where the fish is as fresh as can be and prepared excellently. The owner is always on hand and very attentive and the atmosphere is casual and welcoming. Best appetizers are crab cakes with virtually no filler, great steamers and freshly prepared shrimp cocktail. For entrees there are so many choices that are excellent including an amazing swordfish preparation, the best soft shell crabs when in season, cedar plank trout, whole branzino and many others. Once you discover this small restaurant you will return over and over as so many regulars here do.",4
"Hadn't been there for years...just as great as I remembered! Service, food and very cordial staff!",4
"An abundance of choices of exquisitely fresh seafood, nicely prepared, is the reason to come here. Since they are a seafood market, they have more variety on hand every day than do most restaurants. Menu changes daily according to what is available. Everything they serve is high quality. We had crab cakes, snapper, & branzino; enjoyed each very much. A nice plate of excellent cole slaw (made with almost no mayonnaise) is put out even before you order. Service is attentive; easy enough because there are only maybe 8-10 tables for diners. It is easy to converse with both your waitress & the owner behind the counter. Wine selection is surprisingly good & they also allow people to bring in their own. We had a nice Malbec/Shiraz blend at a reasonable price. The decor is full of funky nautically themed decorations. It is very casual. You can have a very nice meal here for lunch or dinner, with no pretentiousness or B.S. I have eatn here many times over the years & am sure to return.",4
"A hole in the wall with the freshest seafood! Not only was the seafood fresh, but the non-seafood items were treated with chef's pride. Everything we ordered was extremely flavorful, from our daughter's pasta to our oysters and shrimp pasta.",5
Fresh delicious seafood  served by an attentive and friendly staff  in a charming setting. Calamari with buffalo sauce always a winner.  A solid local gem!!,4
Incredibly fresh seafood in a casual environment where everyone feels like home.  Staff is extremely personable.,4
always  have a great time..food bar tender service  all top of the line   good home town vib,5
"Exceptional food and service, as always! This place is a hidden gem!",5
"The Swiss In was a wonderful experience. The food and host were so warm and welcoming. If you like desserts, the carrot cake alone is worth the trip!",5
A charming restaurant with excellent food. Nice conversation with the owner. Will definitely go back.,5
Visiting from New York and wanted to get fondue. My family is from Switzerland so we jumped when we found this place on open table. The food was authentic and delicious. They carried Swiss wine which we can never find. The service was wonderful as was the food. Will definitely come back when back in this area.,5
Loved the owner and the soufflé and the fondue and Swiss veal were world class,5
We were nearly the only people in the restaurant but received friendly service from the start.  The host was friendly and talkative and the waitress very attentive.  We had the special spinach salad and shared the beef fondue for our meal.  Very satisfying.,5
"I can't say enough about how good of an experience my family had at this restaurant.  The food was excellent, particularly the Swiss fondue.  The staff was friendly and inviting, and very welcoming of our 10 month old baby. ",4
"My wife and I come up to Manchester every year. This was our first time trying this restaurant and after the exceptional experience we had, we're planning on making it a regular stop.",3
"Five years running, this place is a family favorite on our annual trip to Vermont. Worth the 20 minute drive from Manchester, this unassuming restaurant set inside a modest inn is always a pleasure. The proprietor is good natured and quick with a laugh, and the service is always friendly and fast. The fondue, schnitzel, spätzle, and rosti are highlights, but everything on the menu is great.  Each year, this is the first reservation we make for our trip. Try it; you could get hooked, too.",5
"Quaint spot.  Good for fondues.  But unfortunately, our children did not like the fondues.",5
"I was pleasantly surprised with the food at the Swiss inn.  I checked into the Swiss inn after long drive from NYC, and was able to reserve last minute late dinner reservations thinking there wouldn't be too many options in the area.  I was beyond happy with the experience, the staff and owners were all super friendly and the food was filling and excellent.  I will be eating here again on future ski trips.",5
"Gracious host.  Excellent food.  Felt welcome.    A bit dated, but so what.   Will definitely return.",5
The restaurant and bar are in need of an update. Food and service was excellent.,5
"The food was exceptional, one of the best meals I've ever had. I LOVE the fact that they offer half portions. Enjoyed appetizer, entrée and dessert and left feeling satisfied but not uncomfortably full. I went early so the restaurant was pretty empty but as more people arrived it became obvious they were repeat customers and I see why. Delicious food and friendly staff.",5
"We found it hard to get a reservations on Saturday night, as it was a holiday weekend. The Swiss Inn was the only place that had early times slots available so we booked something for 7PM. I'm glad we took the chance. My wife and I, and our 2 kids (11 and 12) all loved it. It has old fashioned décor but was very clean and cozy. The food and service were both great. We all enjoyed our meal and shared a chocolate fondue for desert. Fun quiet family dinner. Real nice experience. Give it a try.",5
"Enjoyed the setting. Food good. Owners, very welcoming.",5
The Swiss Inn offers two choices...the Tavern or the Dining Room.  Each has its great points.,5
The food in the dining room is fabulous.  The Tavern menu is excellent and a great value....try the Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich....the rolls are imported from Philadelphia!  The owner (Joe) is a gem.  I had my grandchildren  with us in the Tavern recently.  The 7 month old decided to act up just as my meal was put on the table.  Joe took the baby and brought him around the restaurant and kitchen introducing him to everyone while I ate my meal in peace.  It doesn't get any better than the Swiss Inn!,5
Had a wonderful Christmas dinner with our family.  Great atmosphere and experience.,5
Great food and great service. We always build our itinerary to Vermont around several meals at the Swiss Inn,5
excellent in everyway! have been there  many times..all delicious,5
"From the outside there's not much to recommend the place as it has the appearance of a pretty old motel but inside the dining room is spacious and well maintained and homey.  The food was good......fondue appetizer is enough to share with 2 persons, the main courses were good but the souffles were delicious.  Service was friendly although when they became busier they could have used another person.  Still, it was a pleasant dinner and we enjoyed it.",5
"The Swiss Inn features a widely varied menu at reasonable prices.  The dining room overlooks a scenic area featuring bird feeders that attract a variety of birds, squirrels, and chipmunks (even a bear according to the owner).  We were there early on a Wednesday evening in late August, and were the only dining room guests while we were there; although there were several bar patrons.  We had a wonderful time, being entertained by the owner, and our server.  The food was outstanding, carefully prepared and presented, and served promptly without rushing.  A definite ""go-back-to"" for us.",5
We have had a hard time finding a place to have a great schnitzel and The Swiss Inn is IT!  It was a beautiful dining atmosphere with the birds and wildlife right outside the windows of the dining room and that coupled with exceptional food made it a most enjoyable experience.,5
"The cheese, chicken and beef fondue were excellent. Sauerbraten wasn't as good, but side of spaetzle and veggies made up for it. Will definitely return. Owner Joe was so kind, accommodating and entertaining. ",5
"The food was very good. The decor is dated, kind of like grandma's living room.",5
"While most folks would be in the area for the great skiing, I was there for business. This restaurant was one of the best places I have ever eaten while traveling. The folks who run the place are so friendly that I felt like I was a local. A popcorn machine for the kids was in the large but comfy bar as I passed through to the dining room.All of the food is prepared as it is ordered, so everything is fresh with an extensive menu leaning toward German dishes, but accommodating all palates including vegetarian. It was warm and cozy and snowing as I sat next the window in the low light. Don;t get me started on the desserts! So make your reservations today!!!",5
"Very much enjoyed this ski-area restaurant. My Wiener Schnitzel was delicious - tender as could be, and we all enjoyed the fondue and raclette to start. It's part of a small inn and very friendly and warm. Would definitely go back when in area.",5
This is my first review on open table and I dine out frequently. I am almost 50 yrs of age and I am in the hospitality business .,3
I right this review for one reason only. If I can save another family from an awful experience it would have been worth it.,5
All I wanted was fondue- simple??? I guess not ! The cheese fondue they serve for free at verde was better( that's not saying much).,3
"The beef fondue was atrocious ! Random scraps of beef served with horrible condiments - served on a plate, not even in ramekins ?",3
No fondue forks- given wooden sticks. When I realized I ordered to much food and asked to cancel my cheese fondue - I was told NO.,3
Wrong answer!!!,3
My boys-8&11 couldn't stop commenting on how hideous the decor was.,5
Big bummer!!!!,4
"My whole family enjoyed the food and the experience. We had cheese, beef and chocolate fondue. All were tasty. Service was good -- friendly and prompt. We look forward to going back",5
Great chance to have fondue----including chocolate fondue for dessert! Wine list (by the glass) not very extensive though....,5
Wife and I went with another couple. First time for them; second for us[several years ago]. Everyone was very pleased. Extensive menu-lots of choices for each course. Only thing I'd change would be to add more wine -by-the -glass choices.,4
A mix of American and Swiss cuisine. My trout with lemon and capers was superb. We sat by the window overlooking a little pond and garden and watched lovely birds at the feeder. Staff was great! Soufflé for dessert out of this world.,3
"Portions were generous, even in the half size meals, which was a welcome option on the menu.",4
"Just really nice place to share a fondue. Reasonably priced, very friendly staff. My girlfriend, daughter, and I had a lot of fun and the staff, including the owner seemed to enjoy letting us do so.",5
"The food is home made and great. Simple, tasty, and reasonably priced.",2
Highly recommend the Fondue. The crowd is a little on the older side. If you are young maybe try and sit on the bar side. Lovely owners though and the desserts are amazing. Will be coming back!,5
"A friend and I were visiting the area on a Monday night and were very excited to find the Swiss Inn open for dining. We have visited Switzerland together in the past and love the food. We both indulged in the 3-course prix fixe menu which was a good value. We both had and enjoyed the Veal a la Swiss and desserts were excellent. We had the chocolate souffle which was excellent as was the special of the day, grasshopper pie. We enjoyed our dinner and would go back again.",5
"We made a last minute decision to have dinner at this restaurant. While very quiet and somewhat dated in terms of decor, the food and service were excellent, particularly the Swiss specialties (raclette, fondue, etc.). The bar can be quite animated and fun. Well worth the visit if you are in the area.",5
"Very friendly and accomadating, meal was fresh and well prepared. Would definitely return and try other choices, maybe spend some time at the bar area too! Were there on a Mon. night, so not so busy.",4
Good value for the area and good variety. The staff are friendly and welcoming. Wife and daughter loved the Beef Stroganoff and all enjoyed the fondue,4
"Great steaks and sides and great service! We had a table near the bar area which was obnoxious....people peering at you as your eating and yelling about their day shouldn't be on the menu. The food was fantastic and our server very well informed. We both had filets and split the sides and an appetizer and we were very pleased with our meals. If our seat was better, it would have been the perfect night.",5
"Once again-Del Frisco's exceeded. Upon arrival-I was greeted by name and had my reservation notes on the requested wine brought to our attention. As we sat down, the focused on me and let me drive for the table. Service over the entire evening was top notch, attentive, but not invasive. This is hard to pull off--but they did it.",4
We will be there again next week because of the continued/consistent performance and great experiences we have. Cheers -NOD-,4
Good food buy very expensive.,4
Excellent service.Delicious meal.,4
"Excellent place. Food, service, atmosphere all get a 10.",4
"We have been to Del Frisco's several times and have always enjoyed ourselves. The food is excellent and the service was outstanding, as always. We have recommended this restaurant to numerous family and friends. A top notch experience!",4
The steak was perfect and the wine list was amazing. We will be back there soon!,4
"This is the 5th time I have eaten here-- now will never return. Much of the menu on line--checked out for others going along--was not available here. Table was awful--like eating in the back of a banquet room. Waiters switched off in the middle of the meal. $7.50 baked potato came without garnishes; had to ask for them and then be specific about what was wanted--not the usual array of garnishes offered. A sauce on the side for a steak was $14! And tasted like cornstarch and sugar. Dinner for two with tip came to $250!!!That was for four cocktails, two steaks, one appetizer and two side dishes. I think this place now is designed for tourists in nearby hotels who expect New York restaurants to be overpriced and mediocre.",4
Service was outstanding! Let them know we were celebrating our friends anniversary and we had a time limit given show tickets and they were great. Good suggestions on food. The food was excellent. The sweet potato side dish and three different petite filets with various glazes were a hit.,5
"The overall service was great by Brandon our waiter and all the service staff. My only complaint was I asked for my steak to be well done ( no pink ),the first time it came out it was still red, the SECOND time it came out it had blood still running out, the THIRD time it was burnt and was unable to enjoy or even eat half of it because it was so tough. Yes we were given a free dessert but after having a great expierence three years ago and then this expierence I am not sure I will return again.",5
One of my favorite NY restaurants. Manly decor. Well made drinks. Best steak I've had since the last time @ DelFriscos. VERY expensive but worth every penny.,5
"Del Frisco's never disappoints and my dinner with a colleague...her first visit, was great. The food, the wine, the service, and even our table location was fabulous. We didn't even mind waiting a bit for our table at the bar--it was hopping! That's why I keep going back!",5
"I went to Del Frisco's with work associates the first time, with had such a great time, I went back the next week with my friends and had an even better time. The food was great, the servers were friendly and engaging. It is now at the top of my NYC favorites list.",4
One of the best meals I have ever had. 7 layer lemon cake positively outstanding.,4
Great restaurant. Amazing food and great service. Every dish we tried was delicious.,5
"Our first time ... it was great experience. Service was attentive, knowledgeable and friendly.",5
Suggestions were perfect. The steaks were done right and delicious. As well as the sides.,5
We loved dining at Del Frisco's in NY. The waitstaff was great & the food was terrific. We actually went back the next night.,4
my favorite steak house in NY,4
We did have to wait although we had reservations but the food was very good.,5
"Fantastic meal and fantastic service! You never feel rushed, and are always looked after attentively without being smothered.",2
"One of our favorite New York City restaurants, Del Friscos never disappoints. The food was exceptional as always, the service the same. Del Friscos remains one of the premier steak houses in midtown, if not all of New York City. There is seldom room for desert given the huge portions, but we always seem to find room! A truly epic NYC restaurant!",1
"It was my husband's birthday & I called ahead to arrange a dessert with a candle after dinner. The minute ""Bambi"" arrived she ruined the suprise by noting that we were there for my husband's birthday. After that error she aggressively tried to upsell us(we had $50+ bottle of wine, a Sea Bass entree, a 12oz. Filet Mignon & one side). My husband was too full for dessert so when she asked what we wanted he said we would pass. Unbeknownst to him I was told on the phone that if my husband didn't order dessert they would bring a lemon cake with a candle gratis. Bambi said dessert was complementary so we ordered the cheesecake due to her insistence. We were charged for it & we paid without complaint but had a completely disappointing experience.",1
If you are looking for steak and all the trimmings.... This is the place to go. I've been there on a date with hubby and for a late lunch with my two picky little eaters (7yr & 10yr) they both loved it. They shared a big steak. They also have great salads.,5
Food was way overpriced for the quality that was presented. Service was outstanding. With so many steak house options I am very unlikely to eat there again.,4
Dinner and service was excellent!!,5
"We had a great time... Food was wonderful and we had a great waitress... Amanda. In fact, I have already contacted the restaurant to let them know ..",4
Great recommendation ..,5
"marcy Zwelling, MD",5
When we arrived we spent time at the bar and enjoyed a few cocktails. The bartender Angela was most accomodating and assisted in selecting the perfect cocktails based on our taste. The server was also most accomodating as he took the time to review the menu and specials for the evening. We have dined at DelFriscos previously as it is my boyfriends favorite Manhattan steakhouse. The steakes are always perfectly prepared and the atmosphere is both eceltic and lovely. Although I am not a serious steak lover I find the menu appealing with its seafood offerings and sides.,5
My guest indicated that the food was some of the best that they had ever had.,4
"Excellent steaks and our waiter was superb and very personable. He had just moved from Tennessee and was talkative without being pushy. If I were to complain about something it may have to be the sides. The asparagus were large and tough(yuck) rather than petite and tender(yum) and the mac&cheese was just plain inedible(and my daughter is quite the expert on mac & cheese - lol). Also, when I reserved our time, I had expressed a concern about making an 8:00 show at the Gershwin. I never heard back from the restaurant, so I reminded our hostess and our waiter while we were being seated about my time crunch. Well - we made the show (barely), but we had to skip dessert. All-in-all, though, it was an excellent dining experience.",4
"Del Frisco's was a great Manhattan experience. We started by meeting Mike, the bar tender. A true New Yorker with a personality that will keep you in stitches. We were having so much fun with Mike that we pondered eating at the bar, but finally opted for a table.",5
"Mike steered us to some of the ""best on the menu"" and some ""off menu"" items and our waitress was pleasant and attentive.",4
"The crab cakes are to die for, the skillet potatoes w/onions are a great side, and the ""bone-in"" Rib eye was the most flavorful and best piece of meat I'd ever eaten in any restaurant.",4
"The deserts were fantastic also, but not good for the diet.",5
"You may pay top dollar to go here, but if you love outstanding food, you can't go wrong!!",4
Del Frisco's continues to be one of the best steak meals in New York City. I've now ate at Del Frisco's 4 times over the last 2.5 years and have yet to have less that a fabulous meal along with all of my friends.,5
Great professional service with an attention to detail and presentation.,5
Great Service.,5
Food was amazing. Best steak I ever had. Food is always consistent and service is on point.,5
You get your monies worth.,5
"Right in the middle of the hustle and bustle of the city, Del Frisco's was a lovely choice for us who were visiting NY and wanted a good place to eat and feel the energy of the city. Our view was fantastic since the walls were made of glass. We could enjoy the city while eating our fantastic steak which was a great value for the money we paid. The service was excellent. We highly recommend it.",5
"Ribeye steak average at best, shrimp cocktaail perfect, bar try's to give you cheaper scotch, when you order 18yr macallan.",5
"Had out of country guests who wanted a NY Steak experience and it was quite good. I had not been in several yrs and was pleasently surprised. Even as a financial svcs the scene in these rests can be a bit much. In any event seated reasonably quickly, waiter very professional, not pushy and very engaging. Steaks as usual very, very good, one of the group's fish of the day excellent. Appetizers and Sides (esp crab cake and mashed sweet potatoes) excellent. Wine list almost too large, with some decent prices especially 1st page with reccomendations and specials. Had a very good Calf Cab 05 from Howell Mt that was exceptional and very well priced. Overall nice eve, total cost in line with high end rests in NYC, def would go back.",5
"My husband and I just moved back to NYC and this was our first stop for a good filet. We consider ourselves steak snobs and the Del Frisco's filet is at the top of our list. We also love the tower of onion rings, though we can never finish it! Our waitress was super friendly and recommended a fabulous wine - reminding us of the fantastic customer service we hadn't experienced while living abroad. A perfect welcome home!",5
very expensive New york dining,5
BEST steak on earth is their filet and best dessert anywhere is the Lemon Cake.  My favorite restaurant in the world!,4
Food and service was delicious. Would return again. Great selection of wines.,4
"Overall the experience was enjoyable.The service was excellent as was the ambiance.Very,very pricy for the quality of food. I have had better food at much lower prices.",5
Great meal especially their steaks!,5
"We went with another couple for brunch to celebrate my birthday. It was all our first time there for brunch and it was excellent. Our server was great and the food was so delicious. We already can’t wait to go back for brunch! It was our first time there since the Barrel Room was built, gorgeous! Adds so much to the property and experience!",5
Solo me retrasaron una hora mi reserva,5
"staff was great! if all the servers treat customers the way ours did then everyone should have a great experience. food was great really enjoyed the entire meal. sometimes when you pay these kind of prices you feel like it just wasn't worth it. not so here! did not mind one bit when we were all done , well worth it!",5
We've been here many times. The food is delicious and the service is great. My husband had a porterhouse and I had a Salmon. We always leave really satisfied.,4
"Being the first time going to Frisco's we didn't know what to expect, only the reviews I had looked at prior to help in making the decision to eat there. Well, the atmosphere is elegant, tables are very spaced out which I love as I don't like dining right on top of the next person. We were seated in a booth which was very comfortable. The menu was on the small side so your choices are limited. The food itself was excellent! Pricey but worth it. I would dine here again.",5
One of my favorite steak houses in the country.,5
Too much. Over the top without the substance. Place to see and be scene if you are insecure or are looking for a sugar daddy. Get at it.,5
as usual the food and serveice were excellent - you do need to take out a sencond mortgage.,5
Fabulous steaks. I had the bone-in strip steak and my wife had the bone-in Filet; both wonderful!,5
Del Frisco's was one of the best dining experiences I ever had! It was wonderful!,5
Very good dining experience. I had to send a strip steak back that had been ordered medium but came out rare. I was told that the steak was medium according to the restaurant standards. The server nonetheless took the steak back and it was then cooked properly.,4
"There are lots of choices in New York for steaks, I was very pleased with our meal at Del Frisco's. The steak was excellent! I had eaten at their restaurant in Dallas and this was even better.",5
A Fantastic Experience. Outstanding meal. Highly recommended.,5
"Food, Ambiance and service was outstanding! Went for my birthday and loved every minute of it, a bit pricey but well worth it.I ordered Filet Mignon and my husband has bone-in ribeye (both cooked to perfection) and for the sides we had skillet potatoes with onions (which was the best) and macaroni with cheese (which was abit boring), but overall delicious! To finish it off they gave us a complimentary slice of lemon cake(icing was too sweet, but the filling was great). I would definetly go again for a special occasion,and highly recommend going for when you're able to splurge.",5
"Good food, horrible service. Waited 15 minutes for water and a wine menu. Water was never refilled without our hounding sides came late I've been to del frisco at least 15 times, why do I get a bad table every tome? Service was just bad. Food was good though.",4
"Overall, the dining experience was very good. The service was outstanding. The food was excellent.",5
"Food was great, service great. But totally overpriced. The most expensive steakhouse in New York.",3
"Steak is not up to par with the top steakhouses in NYC. Filet comes with pepper, cut is not thick, I asked pink, waitress said, medium will have blood, came well done. Don't waste your time at this restaurant when there are so many excellent steakhouses in NYC",2
"We were celebrating our anniversary at Del Frisco's. The food was terrific and our server, Courtney, was outstanding. Indeed, she made our anniversary special. My only complaint was that I had asked for a special quiet table. They first took us to a table in the bar. When we asked for a quieter table they sat us been a group of 14 twenty year olds and a group of six - quiet it was not! Obviously, I wasn't going to ask for a third table and began dinner disappointed in the restaurant. But, with Courtney's arrival, I put aside the noisy ""neighborhood"" and enjoyed myself immensely. She was attentive, enthusiastic, and charming. The service was outstanding. Even brought us a complimentary dessert to share with a candle on top.",4
It was Great Experience - Amazing Steaks!,4
"Our experience at Del Fresco's was great. We were celebrating a special night, and the relaxed atmosphere, GREAT food, and terrific service really make the night complete.",4
"It seemed that the waiter was trying to push the more expensive $70 items that were not on the menu, then what was on the menu itself. We ended up ordering what was on the menu. We ordered steak medium-rare, but what came to the table was more than well done. They had said it will take 20 minutes+ for the entree to be done, and so we didn't want to wait for another 20 minutes over the first 30 minutes to get a medium-rare steak. My son said the meat felt chewy.",4
"We asked for a table for two, not near the bar. There were so many empty tables for two by the windows; instead, we were put in a booth that sits 4.. strange.",5
"Been here many times and it always shines,this time though the waiter was on a mission to get us in and out and it was a little annoying to have to make it clear several times we where not gonna be rushed!",5
The food wasn't as good as I had remembered.  Much less ambiance than the Philadelphia Del Frisco's. The pineapple infused vodka was excellent however,4
"Just mediocre in my opinion. We had a gift card we had purchased at an auction but we likely will not be back. Service was good, our server was very sweet but the food just didn't do a lot for me. I order the salmon which came with ""mushroom risotto"". Brown rice with pieces of mushroom in it is not mushroom risotto. Overall not bad just nothing that will keep us coming back.",5
The drive out to this location is scenic and pleasant.  We enjoy being outside in the summer and celebrating January special occasion events in the winter.  The food is delicious and the wine soothing.  We are always extra happy when we get Angie as our server.,5
We got really lucky and the weather was beautiful on a Sunday in January.  Their new barn was open and brunch was served to perfection.  The service was great and attentive.  The food was hot and the atmosphere was perfect.  Lot's of variety within food choices and the desserts were to die for!  A great low key time with friends and family!,5
"We did Sunday brunch for my sister's birthday and it was lovely. They were very slow that day, I'm assuming because it was snowing. The staff was very friendly and definitely gave us special attention being that there were so few guests. I've also been in the summer when you could barely find somewhere to sit because it was so packed, and the service was great then as well. We have already planned another several outings to be there that were on the list to find a location for.",2
"Was very disappointed in the choice of foods offered and the fact that almost everything was cold, or not hot enough to enjoy.",3
"This visit had both good and the average.  First, the winery is as beautiful as ever and sitting close to a roaring fire provides a great back drop.   Second, the 3 Swans wine we had was very good and we enjoyed it very much.  Third, the service was very good and our server was very friendly even has she had to deal with some large tables in addition to the two of us.  The not as good was the food.  The salads were fine and provided a nice start to meal.  Our entrees were just ok.  We both had the short ribs and we found them to be dry and a little hard to eat.  Extra reduction sauce helped. The portions were enormous as well.  The ""Risotto"" was a rice pilaf that was fairly tasty.  The Brussels sprouts were clearly frozen, although they had seasoned them up with bacon and onions.  Not a disaster, but not up to the standard we remembered from before.",3
"We had brunch inside the winery itself on Valentine's Days, so when we planned our Girl's Weekend, we made reservations to go on November 19th.   The brunch is now in The Barrel Room, which had no ambiance, felt like a warehouse, the food is served in a dark, uninviting room, and most of it was cold, which we brought to server's attention, who by the way was the only good thing about the visit.  This was disappointing because we had people from out of town, and it was a bad experience.   The brunch in February had an omelet station, a meat carving station and a dessert table.  The selection for the $21.95 price was not very good.   There were no toppings for the scrambled eggs such as cheese, the potatoes were cold and not tasty, the brisket was dry and over-sauced, only good tasting things was the salad and green bean casserole dish.   I have been there a few times besides the Valentine's day brunch, and the food at the winery was awesome, so I was very upset the brunch this past weekend was so bad.   I will not be returning, as my 5 other friends and everyone we know will  not.",2
My 2nd visit was much better than my first visit.  ,5
"The staff were very courteous and welcoming.  We were seated prompt, given good explanation regarding the brunch, the food was very good. The setting was great. Everyone in my party was pleased and plan to return.",5
"The dining room was very noisy, with no thought given to sound abatement. We were seated next to a group of ladies, having a good time, but their laughter was very loud and echoed throughout the dining area.  The loud music made having a dinner conversation very difficult. ",5
"My Prime Rib, the most expensive menu item, was served almost cold, and it was very tough and extra fatty.  The flavor was bland and almost tasteless.  I was brought my meal with a very sparse serving  of vegetables and was told that the chef was in a rush,  and more would be brought later.  I was brought more, but it was just odd.",5
"We had a date including happy hour and an early dinner.  We were surprised there weren’t more high tops to sit at since there are no bar stools.  The wine was interesting to try.  A good variety.  The cheese/cracker appetizer we shared was good.  However, we were very underwhelmed with the dinner.  We had a chicken parm plate and a beef short ribs plate.  We agreed the food wasn’t bad but it wasn’t worth the drive or the price compared to just eating at home.  The servers were friendly and attentive.",5
Everything about this place was amazing! The service was great.  The server answered any questions we had and timed our courses perfectly. The food was so delicious.,5
We had brunch on Sunday. Was delicious. We will be going back,5
The Barrel Room is incredible! Very well designed with great views of the lake. The woodwork on the bar is beautiful and table decorations were lovely. Such a great experience for Sunday brunch!,4
My wife and I went to Cedar Lake for her birthday. We were excited to eat in the restaurant since we had a very good experience last year. We arrived for dinner on time and were seated promptly since the restaurant was not too crowded. That was the best part of dinner.  ,5
"After 10 minutes of idle chitchat, I realized the waiter had not approached our table. I purposely did not get the attention of the waiter because I wanted to see how long it would take for him to realize we were seated in his station. After 30 minutes, the waiter never acknowledged us and we decided to leave. To summarize, we were excited to eat at the restaurant but ended up very disappointed.",5
Note to staff: you may want to be more aware when people are anxious to eat at the restaurant. I don't think your owner would be too happy to know that they lost out on the significant dollars we were prepared to spend on dinner because of a total lack of service.,5
"Beautiful setting. Confusion regarding seating (I told hostess we had a reservation, she said they don't take reservations??) Plenty of tables available, though.  Asked several staff members about ordering lunch, got different answers from each. Finally found out where to order food in another building. Some people had waiters but we were told to order at the bar. Staff member behind the bar was nice but a bit  frazzled. She said they were out of almost everything (food) due to large event the day before. Spent $50.xx on two wine slushes, a beer, nacho chip (with cold cheese & a pinch of pulled pork), and a few pretzel sticks. Then went out to eat somewhere else. ",5
May go again sometime just because of convenient location and beautiful setting. Won't ever go expecting to eat.,1
Good for date,5
"Food  was great, but service was okay. It was offensive our waiter started to clean the floor before we left the table.",5
Great service and the food was excellent.,4
Absolutely amazing food. The staff are extremely generous and kind to you. Everything was perfect. A little pricey but I was ready to pay a high bill before even getting there. By hey.. what do you expect for a high end steakhouse in the middle of NYC. ,5
Al in all 1000% worth it,5
"We went during restaurant week. Even though it was clear that we were not business men on an expense account we were treated as if we were.  The food was excellent and the service was spectacular. It was an exceptionally good value due to the restaurant week pricing, But there was a reasonable business man's lunch on the regular menu",5
This was my 7th time here but it was my best friends 1st time . She loved the decor all the way down to the dessert. We were at a great table with the best view of all the buildings along avenue of America’s (6th Avenue) including radio city music hall. Me and her booked our reservation through open table for restaurant week but when we arrived we were notified that we could not order food from the restaurant week prefix menu because it wasn’t available for dinner (only lunch). I was a little discouraged because that wasn’t explained on the website but our waitress managed to fix the minor issue and offer us something close to it. She was very nice & personable. We recieved a 3 course meal for $60 each (well worth it). We had Cesar and their house salad which had the most delicious avocado ranch dressing on it topped with a well done slab of cured brown sugar smoked bacon on it. We also had the salmon & fillet midallions with the famous Lobster mac and cheese for our main course. For the desert we had a creamy chocolate mousse and cheesecake that was to DIE FOR!! The service was phenomenal. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for 5 star quality service and delicious food. It is a little on the expensive side but it’s worth every penny. Thank you for making my best friends 1st experience here special. We’ll be back soon❤️,5
Absolute best as always,5
7 big guys and a cramped table upstairs in the corner by the window...only complaint! Management should’ve been able to help us out somehow...food and service were excellent!,3
"Service was awful!!!  Waitress kept claiming she was ""sick"".  Cut of filet mignon had fatty pieces and it was super small.    I would not recommend this place at all.",2
I have eaten here many times. Back in 2008 we had our sons graduation party after he finished his West Point degree.  Very special place for our family!  This time it was our 30th wedding anniversary!  Received a signed card from the staff ❤️ Can’t say enough good things about Del Frisco’s!! A must for every visit to NYC!!,3
"I always enjoy me meals at delfrisco, they have the best steak.  I took my friend there in honor of her retirement.  We had the best time ever.  My friend was really impressed and I'm sure she will return as i will.",5
"Overall, a wonderful experience, as usual!",3
"At Del Frisco’s, I look forward to the steaks. The steaks are  expertly cooked to your requested temperature. For Rib eyes, I recommend medium to caramelize the fat just a bit more or in general medium rare. The service was engaging but not intrusive. My water glass was never empty... Excellent. Thus is s must go to impress or to celebrate in style.",5
A good experience with restaurant week!,3
Mashed potatoes and cheese cake were delicious!,5
"For fellit steak, I think it's in normal standard.",5
The staff was professional and knowledgeable about the menu.  Great ambiance!,5
Celebrated birthday and watched the Superbowl.  Great table setting near bar area.  Waitress/staff very attentive.  Presented me with a beautiful and delicious birthday desert.  Thank you Del Frisco's.,5
One of our favorite restaurants! Ashley our waitress was excellent and spot on with her recommendations and service.  The only draw back was that the restaurants was very cold and we could've used a little heat.  Other than that zero complaints.,4
I have going to del frisco for the last 15 years..Love the steak and crab cake.,5
"A little disappointed in the dress code. T-shirts, baseball caps.",5
"Love the spot and the food, especially before the theatre.",5
Outstanding Service and Food. Highly recommend for those looking for a great dining and food experience.,5
Dinner was good; tender juicy perfectly prepared Double Eagle strip and cheesy potatoes. Mediocre Caesar salad. Large wine list with mostly pricey selections with a few for $200 or less. Room is huge and loud and for our Friday evening 8:30 reservation still filled with groups of white shirted work groups getting louder and more boisterous. Go with your own group and be prepared for the noise of the huge room.,4
"Dinner plans for my husband's 35th birthday went very well! Thanks to our waitress, Andrea, for being professional, courteous, and accommodating. We are also thankful for the delicious slice of lemon cake (with candle) my husband blew for the occasion. Delicious food, great service, and nice location. We'll definitely come again and recommend it to our friends.",3
"Traveling from Miami we didn't expect to find great fish dishes in NYC. We were wrong. The sea bass is melt-in-your mouth incredible! The steak medallions absolutely tantalized every taste bud --- the sides are enormous, and indescribably delicious! One must not visit NYC and miss out on Del Friscos! The staff is courteous, interesting and willing to do whatever is possible to enhance the dining experience. Make a reservation, sit back and relax, and let the meal overtake your senses!",4
The food is outstanding!!! Incredible!!!,5
Special shrimp appetizers were delicious. Nice atmosphere for a business lunch. Service was very good. Only complaint was that my entree salad had too much dressing on it. But I would certainly go back to try more of their offerings.,4
"We had a great table in the corner, and even with all the noise and energy all around us I was able to still ahve a pretty intimate conversation with my date.",4
"This is the Place I go when I want the best steak in nyc, and to impress friends from out of town. They never disappoint.",5
"This was our second time at the New York location. The food was excellent, very delicious. The service was great. The wait staff was very attentive, and always there to help. Our New York Favorite!",3
Our server was very nice and attentive. Our experience there was excellent. A little noisy for me but the food made up for it. I would def. come back!!!!,5
"The atmosphere was great and the service was excellent. The sauces are delectable. However, the steak at Del Frisco's is very heavily seasoned. The steak was a good quality and was overall pretty good, but not really my taste. I prefer steak to be lightly seasoned and to taste the flavor of the meat. If I return, I will have to ask for it with less spices...",5
I felt the restaurant was over priced for the food and service. We happen to be sitting at a table close to the kitchen. My son kept getting hit in the back when the waiters were rushing in and out of the kitchen. Also my son and daughter in law had Filet Mignon which was over cooked. I wouldn't choose this restaurant again when there are so many to choose from.,5
Our most recent experience at Del Frisco's was wonderful. The food was delicious and our steaks were cooked perfectly. The wine selection was impressive and our server was out of this world. We will definitely be back again soon.,5
"What's not to like - this has it all, great service and great steak - it's the total New York City steak experience. While other steak houses are notable in NYC, the floor to ceiling windows provide the New York feeling and city energy while dining.",4
Absolutely wonderful food! Best steak I have every had. The only improvement I would recommend is tha the bar scene is so vibrant that if you are placed anywhere near the bar you will not be able to hear yourself think. Make sure to request a table away from the bar if you want conversation.,3
"Unfortunately, despite a reservation, we were not seated until about 25 minutes AFTER our reservation time. Despite being told that ""we are finding you a beautiful table, you will love it"" we were finally escorted to a table right next to the bar- where the noise was deafening - and serving station. We declined that table and were finally seated at a quiet table in the back.",1
"Pizza and salad - yummy!  Best pizza ever.   Homemade dough and sauce, excellent pepperoni and topping.  We had the best server, Allie B.  She was terrific, efficient and very friendly!",5
Service was wonderful,4
"Everything was perfect, however, we would suggest having more lighting for outdoor evening dining.  We couldn't see the food we were eating.  The waiter tried lighting candles for extra light but that wasn't much help and then the wind blew them out.  Maybe a different type of lighting would help.    When we arrived it was still light out, but by the time we received our food, it was dark.  ",4
The food was awesome and service great!,3
Food was great but there was to many flies over food!,2
Food needs to be covered.,2
"We thought the food was FABULOUS!!! Great brunch menu, with lots of tasty desserts.  ",4
Our only complaint was that the music (and not our taste) was too loud for us to really talk.,4
"Otherwise, wonderful experience and will be back soon.",3
"Like the place, the ambiance was good, but the side dishes of risotto and veggies were poor quality.  The beef and fish were good, along with the appetizer and wine!",2
"Good food and setting. However, service was slow. ",3
"I would choose the casual yard setting next time, perhaps reserve a firepit by the lake.",5
"We love Cedar Lake Cellars for the wine and atmosphere.  We had never to the restaurant before so decided to try it on Sat.  The service was slow and not friendly.  The food was terrible.  I've never said that before about a restaurant, but in this case I can't say it any other way.  My husband had the Parmesan Chicken and the pasta tasted like they opened a can.  I had the Shrimp and Grits.  The shrimp was rubbery with no taste and the grits tasted like they had ring bologna chopped up in it.  We will definitely go back to drink wine and enjoy the outside atmosphere, but we'll never go back to the restaurant again.",1
"Great way to spend a weekend day.  The food was very tasty but on the buffet it was a little cool,  or not as hot as expected.  The guest seem to all have a good time.  When we went ther was a band who did a great job keeping the crowd engaged.",5
"Beautiful place with great food, wine and music. Sunday Brunch was great and the view of the water adds so much to the experience.",5
The food was great and had lots of variety. The included first drink was a nice starter.  Scenery is great and the staff was very nice.,4
"This was our second time enjoying brunch.  On this occasion we celebrated my mom's birthday.  Our first time was in their tasting room, the second time in their barrel room.  Both were great and enjoyable.  The sangria was delicious and while this doesn't have your standard carving and omelette station their beef tenderloin was amazing and by far delicious and did not disappoint.  In addition to the gorgeous weather, view, and amazing staff the meal is the best brunch value I've ever found.",5
Dinner was not good. Little flavor with a high price. I've had the brunch and nachos on previous trips and they were excellent. The service and atmosphere was awesome!,2
"First time that we stayed for dinner at CLC.  I ordered short ribs.  Short ribs are usually fall off the bone tender.  These were not.  Tough and no flavor to speak of.  The accompanying risotto was equally bland and unimpressive.  The vegetables best described as 'tired'.  With all of their web hype about chef, etc. I expected an actual dining experience.  No one else at the table was impressed with their food choices, which included the salmon and chicken parmesan. This was not an experience I will look to repeat.",2
Very nice place. Ambiance was really nice over looking the lake. They had a live band playing that wasn't too loud while eating dinner. Will be back.,4
"Absolutely beautiful establishment.  Plenty of room to accommodate crowds with the new Barrel Room addition which also allows a little more distance from the band stage.  Sunday brunch was very nice, although we had to wait quite a while to be served our beverages (mimosas, sangria).  New chef had removed bread pudding from brunch menu much to our dismay.  Hopefully it will be reinstated.  Staff was extremely friendly.  This was my first time to visit and I was very impressed.",2
Beautiful atmosphere but slow service.,3
A delightful surprise near our summer cabin. We appreciated the fine service of our waitress Sarah.,4
"The food and wine were very good, and it was a very nice atmosphere. It is a bit pricey. Some lower priced menu items would be nice.",4
Caesar salad was okay..very little dressing and the French onion soup was disappointing.  Service was good.,3
"My husband and I looked so forward to our date night and for him to get crab legs.  It was a pleasant surprise to him that on Thursday's you have all you can eat crab legs.  While the food both his and mine was very good, hot and initially served within a reasonable time, he was not asked if he wanted more crab legs until 5-10 minutes after he finished his current plate, each time.  We're accustomed to service for AYCE food to be more frequent and closer to when you finish your current plate, rather than up to 10 mins after and then it's another 10 mins to get the reorder delivered.  I really enjoyed my Mediterranean shrimp, but I think it would still be fabulous with a little less capers.  Lastly, it felt pretty chilly in the dining area, but I put my coat on and was fine.",4
"Excellent service, and food cannot find enough good restaurants.  Frequent Del Frisco's always a great experience.",5
my favorite place; especially love the shrimp cakes,5
We ran a little late and they held the table for us even though we were about 5 minutes past their 15 minute grace period. They were quite busy but accommodated our late arrival and we were directed to their upstairs bar where we waited about 10 minutes before our table was ready. The cocktails were great and it was nice that there was a large TV upstairs. I made a reminder to myself to possibly return for their bar and bar menu during baseball season. ,5
"The service was spot on and the food was very good. We were not rushed to go through the courses and we were not pestered by over anxious waitstaff either. We had the bacon for an appetizer which we highly recommend if you like smoked meat. The wedge was nice, but what you would normally expect  but it was exactly what I wanted it to be; crisp lettuce, chunky blue cheese, and crunchy thick bacon. The onion rings were great, not too oily and they reheated nicely the next day. The cauliflower was good, but a touch too ""funky"" for me to go with the dry aged steak. Both our steaks were cooked perfectly to medium rare. The chocolate souffle at the end was overcooked and more of a flour-less chocolate cake than a souffle but was still tasty.  We brought our own bottle of wine for a $50 cork fee, which was great considering there are some competing restaurants in the city that do not allow outside bottles. Overall it was a fantastic experience and we will definitely be returning.",4
"I had made a reservation over a month ago for my boyfriends birthday. The food was very good but our seating area wasn’t. We were shoved back in a side room, away from the true ambiance of the Del Frisco experience, which made for a less than overwhelming experience.",5
"My visit was for a Special Occasion, this is not the spot for a Quiet Conversation or Romantic Evening.  We were seated close to the Bar side of the restaurant which could have been part of the problem , but the restaurant was aware that my reservation was for a special anniversary and could have seated us in a different section of the restaurant.  The restaurant did give us a Celebration Desert plate at N/C.",5
"Consistently one of the very best steak places in Manhattan.  The steaks for our party of four were perfectly cooked, tender, and well seasoned.  The sides were similarly outstanding.  Always a fun evening at DelFrisco’s.",5
"My boyfriend and I had an unbelievably amazing experience there on Saturday 2/3/2018. I can't wait to come back. The food, drinks, and service all exceeded our already high expectations. I can't celebrate the wait and kitchen staff enough. What a dream the whole experience was.",5
"Food was phenomenal, service was a bit stuffy. Great people watching view from the second floor",5
I brought my friend for her birthday.  ,5
Everything from ordering food to paying was a great experience. ,5
In my opinion I wouldn’t go any where else to have a superb steak dinner.,5
"Beautiful setting, delicious food, attentive and knowledgeable waiter!! A bit pricey but the total experience made it worth every penny! We mentioned that it was my sons birthday and the waiter surprised us with a birthday cake/dessert platter for him, big enough to share!! So sweet!",5
Great Steakhouse~Highly recommend!,5
Always great,5
The runner brought our bacon and prime rib to table next to us. When they carried plates. The back of plate touches the steak. Unacceptable.,4
"Great birthday experience, everything tasted amazing. Service by Sara was awesome.",1
"If you like steaks and/or seafood, this is your restaurant. The food is fantastic, the service is wonderful, the wine list is huge, and you’ll leave full and satisfied. Yes - it’s expensive...but - in my mind - worth the price.",2
"A very nice place. Let’s start off with they had our reservation and no waiting. We were seated right away with a nice view. Del Frisco is spacious so no one was on top of each other and me and my other was able to have a conversation. The bread was delicious crispy in the outside and soft on inside and hot. The butter was nice and fluffy. We ordered the oysters on half shell and king crab legs for appetizer, the wagyu tomahawk chops and Brussels sprout for dinner and chocolate soufflé cake, espresso double shot and tea.  The oyster and crab legs was fresh. The first problem was the wagyu tomahawk chop was crispy outside (nice) but when you cut into it there was way too much fat. We told the waiter (I think his name was Joel) he brought over one of the manager who saw how fat it was and offered another steak but by then we were a little turn off so they told us it would not be charge. We felt bad and wasn’t trying not to pay so we decided to order a dessert. Problem number two was the dessert came and no espresso or tea till after the dessert was done. We found the dessert dry like it had been sitting a while because the molten chocolate had already dried into the cake and wasn’t flowing any chocolate from the middle. But Joel was nice enough to get the dessert, espresso and tea taken off also. So not the best on the food this time but the service was great and really nice of them to take off the bill everything that was not great. The bill came to about $135 and we gave Joel a $65 tip for trying. We definitely will be back to try something else and hopefully it will be better and get to pay the entire bill. Thank DelFriscos for the great service and see you soon!",1
"My experience whenever I go to Del Frisco’s is beyond amazing. Their service is amazing, their food is amazing. Everything about them is just amazing! I’m always raving to my friends about them how great this place is.",2
The food and service is always very consistent. Our food came out very timely and was great! The server was extremely attentive and pleasant.,5
"Our server Nikki was fantastic!  Very caring, efficient, and friendly server.  The food was wonderful.  The presentation of the entrees was excellent.  All staff members are GREAT!!",5
"Excellent luncheon menu, excellent server (Allie), and wonderful atmosphere.  The quality and quantity of the entrees were  great!!  Great place for  lunch and/or get together s.",5
Excellent food and wonderful service from Nick.  Great atmosphere and great presentation of entrees.,5
"Terrific service, food and atmosphere.  Everything was so very good.  Server was so efficient and friendly.  All staff was excellent.",5
"We went for dinner and ended up spending 4.5 hours for laughs with friends.  The staff were great and very attentive.  They went above and beyond to make sure we had a great evening. From our dinner server, to the bartender, to the manager- all superb!",5
Had great service everything was prepared perfect. Definitely will be going back...,5
"Excellent entrees and salads.  Terrific service by server, Nick. Pasta was excellent and salads were fresh and bread plate was great.",5
"The food and service were outstanding. Table for 7 ready right at our reservation time even though they were very busy. Our server was very attentive and was on top of our every need. Couldn't believe how fast our meals were ready. We hadn't quite finished our appetizers. The food was wonderful. The lasagna was huge! Highly recommend the fried dough for a group dessert. This was our first time there, but will definitely be going back.",5
"We have been fans of this restaurant for years. Great pizzas and salads.  Stromboli is excellent as well. Service is generally good. Manager in reception is helpful and the full bar is a definite plus. Our last meal was great as usual. Only two complaints were the wedge salad (unfortunately comprised almost entirely of the pale yellow core of iceberg lettuce) and our waitress was a little too eager to flip our table.....to the point that my 12 year old daughter noticed. Despite that, our servers are usually conscientious to a fault and I guess even lettuce can have a bad day.  So overall I’m a loyal customer and will definitely go back.",5
Great food and a great atmosphere. We enjoy dining here!,5
"The food was delicious and our server,  Cookie Pusateri was the best!!!",5
Luncheon specials were delicious and plentiful.  Everything was cooked just right .  Service was excellent with server “Cookie”.  She is one of the best!,5
Excellent entrees and terrific service.  Food was very flavorful and presentation was great.,5
"Terrific food, presentation, server and atmosphere!  What a great family owned restaurant.  Everyone is so friendly.",5
"Great food, service was excellent...Devin took great care of us!",5
"We had a enjoyed our visit, food was good, servings were big and a very comfortable atmosphere.",5
"Late lunch - beautiful atmosphere with very friendly staff.  Food was excellent- wonderful presentation and excellent taste.  Server, Cookie, was terrific.  She was friendly,  efficient, and very knowledgeable.",5
Excellent food and service.  Staff very friendly and courteous.  Pizza and Stromboli was superb!,5
"Pizza, salads and drinks — excellent!!   Staff was excellent, friendly and efficient.  Wonderful restaurant!!",5
"We had a wonderful time at giammarco's, celebrating a friend's birthday and having my parents with us as well. The staff was absolutely amazing in the way that they handled our service. Everything was hot and prompt to come out of the kitchen. They made us a very good Manhattan for all four of us to try since we had never had one before. They also brought out a nice dessert for the birthday girl. Thank you for such a fun evening!",5
"Excellent food, excellent service (Allie B), and excellent atmosphere.  Great presentation of entrees and wonderful and efficient service by Allie.",5
Wonderful night. Our server Nicki was outstanding and I very much look forward to dining there again.,5
"Excellent table by the fireplace.  Terrific brunch with a great server, Kelsey.  The presentation of the food was excellent, the flavor was excellent, and the service excellent.  Would definitely recommend Giammarcos for Sunday brunch.",5
Great service. Great food. Great wine selection.,5
Great! Great value for restaurant week and great food,5
We have enjoyed the Wine Bistro many times. Restaurant week provided a great opportunity to dine there with a limited selection that provided some of our favorite dishes and introduced us to a couple of new ones.,3
Had a great time here for restaurant week. Really good food options and a nice wine list. Loved the ambiance of the place and our waitress was the perfect balance of attentive but not overbearing. Would love to come back.,5
The restaurant was full with people taking advantage of Restaurant Week . Our sever Christina was fabulous and the food was  excellent.,5
"It did seem like we waited an unusually long time between our salads and our entrees, but we at least had wine to drink and when the food did come, it was delicious! Can’t beat the value for Restaurant Week.",5
"Been to this location several times. Went recently as part of Columbus Restaurant Week and ordered off of the prix fix menu. App was the veal meatball. Nice! Meatball was huge with a nice beefy flavor. It was covered with a nice tomato sauce and plenty of cheese. Loved it! Main course was my ""go to"" when I dine here - Beef short ribs with creamy risotto and glazed carrots. The short ribs were so tender and flavorful, the risotto was rich and creamy and the glazed carrots were perfectly cooked, nice and sweet, to cut the richness of the short ribs and risotto. Zoey was our waitress. She was attentive and sweet. The place was busier than I've experienced in past visits and pretty loud, not that I minded. It's usually a little more serene. Altogether though, it was a great atmosphere. The only downfall was that they ran out of the desert I ordered, the caramel apple crisp with ice cream.",5
First night of restaurant week and the wine bistro delivered! We absolutely loved their 3 course $25 limited menu which included a shrimp and chorizo mac and cheese which was  super delicious! Service was attentive and fabulous like is usual.,5
"No ambiance at all. Loud , cafeteria like. Our wait staff was nice but.....she left our table and didn't even get one persons order, we asked for 2 extra wine glasses so our friends could taste our wine....she never brought. Then noticed she didn't and still did nothing. ",5
I will go to the wine bistro on route 23. Way better,5
"Great food, great wine and great evening.",5
Good food as always.   Service is also excellent.   They stayed open in inclement weather to honor our reservation which was much appreciated.,5
"We have been here multiple times, but it has been about 6 months since our last visit. This time, I was very disappointed in the portion sizes of the meal. The baked Brie appetizer was MUCH smaller than what I recall, with the Brie being smaller than the palm of my hand.",4
"As always The Wine Bistro does not disappoint.  Great ambience, congenial staff, and food is usually good to excellent.  They have ""returned"" 3 seasonal specials which are excellent ""comfort"" foods for these cold winter days.  Enjoy!",5
"I met my friend at the Wine Bistro in Westerville for an early dinner.  We chose a bottle of wine off the menu and had them uncork it for us.  They were very good on recommendations.  It was still happy hour, so we ordered several items off the happy hour menu and shared them.  The half truffled mushroom bruschetta was my favorite.  The flatbreads were also delicious.",4
"We ordered their short rib dish served with risotto and a chop salad.  The salad was OK, not great, not bad, but OK.  The short rib dish was a large portion.  Not enough gravy/sauce on the meat, so the meat seemed a bit dry. The risotto was way too thick.  Don't think I will return.",5
The food and service was great.,5
"I have been to the Westerville location several times. Service has never been great but we love the ambiance and the food and of course the wine!  But this visit we had Abby has our watiteress and she was AMAZING!  Bubbly, great personality, informative and just made our overall experience better!  She’s a keeper for sure.",5
We had a party of 7 in the back room.  The service was great and the food is consistently good.  I ordered the crab cake appetizer and the salmon dinner.  Delish!,5
"The service at this Wine Bistro leaves much to be desired. It was wine tasting night- the restaurant was full. We did have a large party of 11 but if you cannot accommodate a party of that size don't take the reservation!  Our server complained several times about being confused (bringing wrong food to the table), overwhelmed (rude and snarky) and finally said, ""It's awful in here right now, I wouldn't be here if I didn't have to be."" I spoke to a supervisor- no manager on duty. They worked hard to make things better, but it was an uphill climb. I would give this restaurant -5 (negative 5) stars for service and would never return again. Ruined a birthday celebration that had been planned for weeks.",5
food was excellent....service on the other hand was horrible.  it took forever for our server to show up or come back with the bill,5
Great place to eat.  Service is good and the ambience is nice..,5
"Great , friendly service.  Super atmosphere, grounds.  Live music.  Always a pleasure to be there.",3
Amazing!     I can say it all with this one word. Can't wait to come back and bring friends to try it,5
"My husband and I had dinner here for our Anniversary. The atmosphere, food, and service were excellent! We will return!",5
The Sunday brunch is always delicious here.  The offerings change seasonally and the fresh fruit and tomato mozzarella salad were refreshing on this visit.  The stuffed french toast required seconds as did the thick sliced bacon cooked just right!  One adult beverage is included and I'd highly recommend the Sangria!   We dined outdoors under the shade of the large umbrella and were comfortable even on a very hot late summer morning.,5
"Shannon was a very exceptional server on Friday night  around 8:00. Will return just to have her but, of course, everything was very nice.",5
"The BBQ was OK but not great, and overpriced for what I received.  Wine was nice and the location was enjoyable.",5
"Had a wonderful time. Nice music, great view and awesome food. Would recommend this place to anyone.",5
The food was wonderful.  The steak was cooked to perfection.  The pasta was very flavorful. We will definitely be back soon.  We got great service!,4
"Our server was great! I had the beer cheese soup and black bean burger and fries. Wouldn't recommend the soup, but the burger and fries were great. We were a party of 8 and while sitting at a rectangular table it was a little hard to hear due to the noise level in the restaurant. But a fun atmosphere and the views will be awesome in the summer overlooking the golf course.",4
Great brunch and Bloody Marys!  Wonderful location!,3
New ownership has provided a huge improvement in food quality and service.   We will be back!,5
All six of us enjoyed our food and the atmosphere is great.  Bar area and dining area have nice separation. Service was a little slow when it came to reordering & bringing drinks otherwise food came fast & she was personable.  We would recommend & will definitely go back.,5
"Birthday dinner for 6. Cozy, great fireplace but very loud with 3 large groups in the dining room. May need carpeting. Very good margaritas and brandy Manhattan s. One fair ribeye and one excellent ribeye. Excellent au gratins and scalloped potatoes. Very good garden side salad and ceasar salad. Beer cheese soup had good flavor but texture was grainy. Complimentary cookie with ice cream was very good and very appreciated. Service was also good. Parking was good. Bar area looked cozy too. Will come back for the summer patio dining and planned fire pit.",5
it was our first time here and it was awesome.   our server becky was attentive and very sweet.  we got the saturday steak special and omg wow.  my only complaint was they did not stock crown xo at the bar.  what can i say im spoiled:),5
"Second time we've had dinner there lately.  BOTH times we had to ask to have the fireplace lit, and BOTH times we had to ask to have the candle on our table lit...  No napkins or silverware on the table, when we were seated.  It's like they don't know it's winter, or they don't  expect diners to arrive for dinner.... Wha?  Someone's not on the ball...  BUT, the service was good, and the food was excellent, so we'll be back!",4
"We were the only ones in the restaurant which was very nice for our Christmas get together. ..very quiet. The waitress was pleasant and the restaurant is cozy. The food was not very good.  I had a Prime Rib French dip. It was dried up reheated meat on a huge bun. I will give it another try, but the food needs to be improved upon.",4
Pig Wings were fantastic!,5
"We've been to the restaurant many times and the ambiance is great, the food is always high quality and the service is fast.  It may be a bit hard to locate the restaurant, but it's worth the effort!",4
Great cozy feel in the dining room. service was very good and responsive to requests nice menu without being over priced,5
This restaurant has gone through several evolution's over time.  The latest version has a nice atmosphere and a simple menu.  The Saturday night steak special was a good value and well prepared.,4
"Our server, Lizzy, was really good!",4
"However, when we arrived for dinner with reservations, we were not greeted for at least 5 MN. Not even the bartender, who glanced our way, acknowledged us. We were finally greeted as we found our way to a table by ourselves.",5
"Two of our dinners were good, but for the first time ever, couldn't even eat my meal. I gently sent it back. Amish chicken and wild rice. The rice was inedible from salt overload and the chicken had good flavor but was so over cooked it was tough and dry. Bone-in chicken, no less. After sending it back to the cook, we were told we weren't the first to complain about the overly salted rice dish. ",4
"The meal was taken off our bill, and we were given a nice dessert, but sadly I just wanted to have dinner. ",5
"Cake, instead of dinner, was a nice thought, but dinner would have been more nutritional, and filling.😞",4
"Good food, good environment, friendly waitress. Service a little slow, but we’ve had worse. We’d go back again for sure.",4
"Our first time at T. Morris and it was pretty good.  Service was a little slow for not very busy, but very friendly.  Will try again.",5
We were meeting kids and grandkids for brunch at 10:00.  The brunch is a fairly new feature so they may still be working out kinks.  We were the only people in the plalce and yet our food took a REALLY long time to come out.  Our server was pleasant and attentive.  I reallly do not think the delay was in any way her fault.,5
"Food was great for a club house bar/restaurant! Good sized portions, service was great and food was delicious!",4
"The portions were quite large, but everything seemed just a bit off: The wedge salad had at least 1/3 cup of dressing dumped on it, shrimp cocktail served awkwardly with no side plate to eat off of, steak served without potatoes and server never came back for me to ask for them until he dropped off the tab.  I have to say, the carrot cake was really good though!   All the staff here were very young and not well versed in restaurant service, acted too casual for a golf club.",5
We were there for a family members birthday. It was a Thursday evening and some of us had the all you can eat crab legs They were a real treat and the server was very attentive. She came back and brought us more in a timely fashion. Others had dishes off the menu and all were happy with their meals.,4
We had a good time and will be back.,2
That’s for providing a wonderful dining spot for any occasion (or even none at all).,2
"We have been here before but I stumbled over a Groupon that had all my husbands favorites (crab cakes, lobster bisque, steak with a lobster tail) so I bought it. We won’t ever be doing that again. We will share an app & get a couple entrees next time. Our server could not have been less interested in us after we revealed the Groupon when we ordered. This is a great place during the warmer seasons. Just don’t expect great service.",4
"Used a steak/lobster groupon for 4 on Sunday night. Was met with little or no interest from the bar keeper and had to wait for a table to be set up. (Hint: if you do that, at least seat us at a table  that we can't see. The one we got was ready all along!)",4
"Portions were extremely small.  Maybe a 4 oz. piece of meat and the lobster looked like a tiger shrimp. The food tasted very good, but not much even with the discounted groupon. Our waitress was nice. She warmed up as the night went on. Service, once seated, was fine.",5
Would not willingly go there again.  There are too many other good restaurants around the area.,4
"Great food, great service!  We had the 4 course meal-very tasty and filling!  We've also been here in the summer and had the lobster roll on the patio and it was terrific!",4
The food was over priced and very small portions. Limited menu on new years eve and nothing looked appealing. Serviced was slow and not friendly,5
I've never seen so many upset costumers with the all you can eat crab special for $20.99 (it's only for the first pound). If you ask for more crab the all you eat price is $39.99 (the staff won't mention the increased price). Use caution when reading this menu. They have NO problems hiding these issues until your bill arrives. I can't go back to place that plays deceptive games with it's customers.,5
"We know committed help is good to find.  This establishment was not prepared to serve a memorable Christmas Eve meal.  We were seated 45 min. after our reservation, being told that the table prior to us just was staying around and talking, but when we were seated it took another 45 min just to receive our meal.    The 7 fishes meal was prepared well, but the dishes",5
looked as though they have been served on multiple times and did not present the food well.,4
"I do not leave reviews, but we drove from Lakeville to Bayport in expectation of a lovely evening only to be grateful when it was over.  No extra deserts or beverages were offered for their lack of providing a pleasant experience on Christmas Eve. (we did not ask, as we did not feel it was our place to do so).  That being said ~",3
"Good food, friendly staff, and a nice atmosphere make for a pleasant evening.",2
"We visited Mallards on Christmas Eve.  We all enjoyed the experience. The food was tasty and nicely presented. The service was fantastic even though the dining room was packed.  The Christmas Eve menu included a nice variety of entrees, and our party of 7 ordered 7 different meals. Everyone was very satisfied.  Thank you!",3
"They were open on Christmas Eve so me and my mom gave it a shot. It was very very good! I will definitely return.  I had the lobster mac and cheese. It was a generous portion and was excellent! The cheese is the absolute gooiest I have every seen, it's crazy!",4
"One of our favorite spots. Good for a nice quiet evening out. Nothing special but you can count on a nice meal, good service, good cocktails, reasonable prices.",2
Food was excellent and so was the service.  Will definitely go back.,2
As ALWAYS this place is spot on!  Thanks Dave!,1
"Mallards has great food with a New Orleans influence. We have been going here for years and the only complaint I would have is that the portions of food have been getting smaller and the prices seem to keep sneaking up. Most of the servers are good and Zach (one of the owners) is a great guy.  We had a Groupon for a very good 4 course meal in our last visit... once again the food was great, but there is no way I would pay the suggested retail price for the portions that we got. We will continue to go to Mallards as long as they keep offering Groupon deals.",5
We couldn't even experience the restaurant because we had to wait 25 minutes after our reservation. We went there about 10 minutes early and still could not get seated. I'm extremely disappointed especially since it was my husband's birthday,5
"At first opening, we were frequent diners at Mallards & recommended to everyone! It WAS great, but definitely NOT RECOMMENDED anymore. As we continued to dine there over time, quality slowly diminished (service, food, drinks). We eventually stopped going there when we realized that there was not going to be any improvements & the quality continued to fade. We recently received a coupon for a BOGO entree & decided to give them another chance. WRONG TO HAVE TRIED AGAIN as the experience was severely lacking still & actually worse. Even with coupon, it was not worth the $. Wood Duck, which used to be a fantastic drink was COMPLETELY undrinkable & the cherry it in that used to be wonderful bourbon soaked, was an off color & even worse taste. Wait staff has gotten more casual & less attentive. Slamming down our waters on the table did not give a favorable first reimpression. I wouldn't expect a mess up of a salad, but Mallards can! Too much dressing (perhaps to cover wilted greens) & fleck of nuts & a piece of soggy fried goat cheese. Steaks were small for the price, but done to our request which is why the food got a ""fair"" rating. Duck rendered fat on the fries was revolting. Fries were underdone & you could literally squeeze a lot of the oil from them & I did to attempt this in some just to salvage something. However, we ended up leaving most of the fries on the plate in their swimming pool of smelly oil. And don't even think of trying dessert. Options sound good, but execution was quite terrible. How can something with sugar ever be bad? Mallards can show you how. And how tacky the menu is with the majority of it being advertisements by local businesses and even more advertisement space on a page than the food/drink options! Also disgusting was the restroom - where there was not a hook on the door for a purse or coat, they were out of the giant rolls of toilet paper, soap & paper towels on 1 side & a toilet continued to run. Restrooms on a Saturday eve unattended?!",5
"Party of 5 and we asked for quick service as we had a show to attend. The food was excellent and the service was fast. The rib eye was one of the very best that I have had. The onion rings where huge and sweet. Skillet potatoes, broccoli where all fantastic. I am definitely going back.",5
Celebrated my daughter's 21st Birthday. GREAT choice. Food was excellent.,5
Great experience! Wonderful ambiance! Outstanding service! Sensational food!,5
Just the BEST!!!,4
We all enjoyed our meal and the service was great. The manager made sure we were all happy and enjoyed our meal and made our experience that much better.,5
"This is one of my favourite ristos in Manhattan! The VIP (pineapple infused vodka) is DANGEROUS - BEWARE! However, it is delicious, as well as their steaks and everything else. Don't forget to have a slice of their Lemon Cake, the house specialty! Bon appetit!",5
"Overpriced and pretentious. And the 1970's ""funk"" music was annoying and intrusive.",5
"How lucky are we to live so close to Del Frisco's! Our first visit with teenage son & friend in tow. WOW ! Peter is a gem of a waiter...we'll be asking for him always...he is a professional with an engaging personlity. The food for each of us was outstanding!!!!!!! Meat, fish, appetizers-- all fresh and delicious. LOVED the energetic ambiance. Can't wait to return again, may try lunch too. Thank you to Peter.",5
"We loved eating at Del Frisco's. It was our anniversary and they made everything so special, including a free gigantic piece of delicious cake and delicious champagne. The food was delicious and service was amazing. My steak was a little more rare than I like it and they took it away and cooked it more right away and even brought us a fresh order of our sides with the steak the second time so that everything was warm together.",5
My dining experience was awesome! My waitress name was Saundra and she was very helpful and attentive.. maginificent. She also made great recommendations for wines and desserts. The food was delicous never could have imagined. I have been recommending it to all my friends and family.,5
The food was amazing and delicious. I am already dying to go back.,5
"Not impressed at all.I had higher expectations on the food. I had the 8oz filet, my boyfriend had the bone-in 16oz which was double the price because the waiter said the bone-in gives it 50% more flavor. When we got the steaks we both tried them and the taste was about the same. Another thing that disappointed me was that I ordered my steak medium and my boyfriend medium-well and we got the opposite so he didn't enjoy his $60 steak medium cooked. We ordered chatoue potatoes and baked potato. The baked potato was descent enough, the chatoue potato had way to much condiments/spices that I barely tasted the potato itself.This was a highly recommended steakhouse that's why we chose to dine there while our visit in NYC.Not worth what we paid for",5
"Great food, wonderful but not overbearing service. Overall and fabulous experience! We'll be back for sure.",4
"The service, food and atmosphere was great! The staff was very attentive! we can't wait to go back! 5 stars!",5
"Excellent! Went to New york for my wife's birthday. Had reservations for 11:15 pm after a show. Got seated on time, great service, great view, great food. Had the crab cakes, 8 oz filt and augrauten poatatoes with lemon cake for dessert. All were fantastic.",5
GREAT FOOD! BEST STEAKHOUSE IN NY!,5
"Del frisco's was very good. They seated us in a little room in the back where there was no view, but we were meeting up with old friends so didn't really care. If we had been entertaining clients or other guests, we would have asked for a different table. The food was very good, overpriced as usual but that's expected at a New York steakhouse. The atmosphere is better than most. All in all a great evening.",5
I researched various restaurants for our pre-theater dinner and had read very good reviews about Del Frisco's. I'm happy to say the reviews were right. We had an excellent experience and I can't think of another restaurant that could have compared to the food and service offered at Del Frisco's. Our waitor was friendly and prompt and provided amazing service. The appetizers and sides were delicious and the steaks were amazing; prepared exactly to our liking. I would HIGHLY recommend Del Frisco's and will return the next time we're in New York.,3
"Amazing food, excellent service, and fantastic table! Thanks MJ Blige for the reco (published in a major magazine)",3
"Heard great things going in, but was very dissappointed with the actual steak. The service was great, but the steak was over cooked and chewy. For a $65 ribeye, I would atleast expect it to be cooked right. If you want it done medium, you better ask for it medium rare.. a cardinal sin for a steakhouse. To top things off.. I ordered a $20 scotch after dinner.. and received the smallest jigger of scotch I ever received. I've been to other steak houses in the city and would rank Del Frisco's towards the bottom.",3
"Sincerely,",5
A very dissappointed patron!!,5
"Great food, Great Service, Great atmosphere!",5
Love this place it's always great!!!,5
"View is really nice, smoked chicken pasta & whitefish were both pretty good. Nicki our server was fantastic however",5
"The overall value is quite good.  This is a new venue for the region, and should not be overlooked.",5
"The service, especially, was attentive without being intrusive, and the food was quite good.",5
This was our first time to the Blue Stem and we will be back.  The entire staff was very friendly and easy going and our server Nikki did a fantastic job in reading us and engaging us.  Very nice young and sincere young lady.  My wife enjoyed the Whitefish dinner and the creative squash side that Nikkie had recommended.  I enjoyed the chopped salad quite a bit.  The only thing that sort of disappointed was the shrimp crabcakes.   I guess I was expecting more from them.  Overall a great experience and I have already told  others about the place and that they should go.  We most definitely will.,4
"We had an excellent dinner at Blue Stem. The white fish was cooked perfectly. My husband order steak and shrimp special, steak was cooked exactly as ordered, rare.",4
Upside-down Apple pie was perfect ending.,5
We will go back again.,4
"Great 1st time experience the scenery was beautiful, the food was good.  I had the shrimp poor boy.  The shrimp was over cooked but it was still good with great flavor.  Service was good, although the waitress could have refilled drinks more than once.",4
This was my fourth attempt. Some things were better. They put in some sound panels so the noise level was much improved. Front of the house was much improved. Service was ok for food. Wine service needs training,5
Food was better on my previous visits. Fish was cooked to oblivion. Cauliflower was an entire head tasted smoked not roasted  parts of it were ok and parts raw. ,3
Probably my last try as it is the most costly of our better dining options but delivers the least. Except the view-that is and was wonderful,4
"We were seated by the windows. Great view. We experienced flies all around us. There were at least 20 on the windows. The flies landed on us and was a constant nucance. Service was good. My lunch was missing one item. I had to ask for it. The bathroom was updated, however, the toilet was not clean.",5
Soooo loud in there we could hardly hear each other talk.  It's a shame because everything else was great.  ... Only plan to go there if you can eat outside where it's quieter and you can enjoy the view.,5
Someone REALLY needs to convince the manager /owner to install an acoustical ceiling and acoustical wall panels in there!,5
"Beautiful View,just had sandwiches but they were terrific and had a special twist all their own,was there on a recommendation from locals,we were there on a getaway,would go back,would like to see outdoor at night with fires and they should add fountains on the hill : )",4
"This was my second time eating at Blue Stem.  I had enjoyed lunch there back at the beginning of the summer and service, atmosphere and food were great.  DInner this week was not very good.  Our service was average. My friend tried to order a ""side salad"" but we were told there was ONLY the ""small plate"" size.  When she ordered it she got a meal size salad... but the table next to us got a small, starter size salad which we were told was not AVAILABLE to us????  My dinner,  chicken pasta dish was dry and tasteless.  It was a huge portion but we were told by our server that if we came back again it would not be that big because the chef was new and didn't really know what size entrees should be.  I had heard about how good their carrot cake was so I attempted to order a piece for dessert.  I was told by the server I couldn't order that because the last 3 pieces were promised to other patrons when they were done with their dinner.  I didn't know I had to ""RESERVE"" a piece of dessert on a Wednesday night.  Not impressed at all and this place does not offer a dining experience that you would expect with the higher menu prices.",5
"We sat outside and the view was beautiful with the fall colors to be seen. But we were not dazzled by the food, not as flavorful as we hoped it would be.",4
We enjoyed a lovely lunch experience. Great views and excellent service.,5
Great food and wine. Entree came 5 minutes after appetizer. Next time we will ask not to rush food.,4
"Overall excellent restaurant, great location.",4
"Our food was good ,loved the black pepper french fries,  our waitress  Exceptional. Very pleasant.  Would return next year on our yearly  golf trip.    Ruth  Johnson",5
Stunning outdoor view will be beautiful when the trees turn fall colors. We were expecting more from the kitchen after hearing folks rave about how wonderful the food was at Blue Stem. I would not agree. The staff was wonderful but the dinners were blah. My husband had the white fish and it was very bland especially the rice that came with the dish. I had the shrimp and grits - lots of broth  not enough shrimp and a small portion of scooped grits. We left feeling there is tons of potential but the kitchen needs to step it up. The outdoor set up is great the inside really felt like a ball room at a public golf course. We sat near a loud table of 8 ladies and we couldn't hear one another with the sound bouncing off the high ceiling.,4
"I really like the Blue Stem. For some reason, however, our meal was quite slow in arriving.",4
"I made reservations a week in advance calling to confirm 2 days before. I requested a table near the window to enjoy the view as we were celebrating sharing a meal with our 3 adult children and our daughter  was visiting from California for her bridal shower. It had been over 5 years that we have shared a meal with our 3 adult children. My daughter's filet was cooked beyond well done, and my son's salmon was undercooked leaving him sick for 2 days! We were not seated at a table in the dining room near the window as requested so we sat on the deck to enjoy the beautiful view, it was chilly and we requested the fire table to be lit. We waited a long time for our drinks, someone to light the fire table and the food.  I reported my extreme dissatisfaction to the manager Melissa. She removed the charges for the filet and salmon from my bill offering free dessert and a round of drinks for 4 of us as the fifth person was not drinking. The manager's efforts to make the dining experience better was appreciated, but it was a horrible experience on a special evening. If this was my first visit to this restaurant I would never go back! However, this was my 4th visit to this restaurant and the absolute worst! I will not be giving any more positive reviews to my friends in the area as I do not want them to have the same horrible experience. They need a better chef, and better customer service to charge the prices on their menu.",2
"Attentive service, exceptional food and warm hospitable staff.",5
"Overall the experience was fun, but not the best Restaurant Week pick--though that's mostly on me. The menu was very slim with two salads offered as options for starters along with a lobster bisque. You could ""upgrade"" your meal for an extra cost to get a steak or something similar, but if you're going for the Del Frisco's experience via Restaurant Week, I would recommend against it. With that said, the French Dip was delicious with a wonderfully doughy baguette and an ample amount of meat. The fries were nicely crisp and salty. The lobster bisque had a good amount of lobster meat, but I was disappointed at the Caesar salads my friends ordered as they were bare and boring. All in all, I won't return to Del Frisco's during Restaurant Week, but I would to dine on their full menu.",5
Grilled octopus was excellent.,5
"Apps were good, not great.",5
Filet mignon small but very good,5
Desserts were outstanding ,5
Waiter and staff very friendly.,5
"the best ! great value during resto week, amazing staff ! love the food !",5
Excellent food and settings,4
"An outstanding lunch, as always. There is nothing too exotic on the menu but the food is cooked to perfection. It is not an inexpensive place so reserve it for a special occasion. But you will not be disappointed.",5
This has become our “go to” restaurant! The food and service are consistently fantastic! The atmosphere is vibrant and warm. The Soccatini is delicious!,5
First time eating here and I will be back.  From the attentive but not overbearing service to the delicious entrees. Our server recognized that we had a serious business meeting with two friends who needed to catch up.  She was just attentive enough but perfectly balanced approach.  Then the food was awesome.  My grilled salmon was done to perfection as was the wedding soup.  I will be back for business and for a date night with my wife.,5
"A great birthday celebration  for a few of our family members.  Wonderful service Chloe!  The food was wonderful- pizza, salad, pasta, wings, meatballs etc.  All staff members were very friendly.  Great job !!",5
"Fantastic food and service!  Server, Allie B., was terrific!  The drinks were refilled immediately, never had to ask for anything. Food was wonderful with great presentation.",5
Wonderful service with Allie and excellent food.  The luncheon menu and prices are great.  The salad and drink was included in the luncheon menu entrees.  The  presentation of each item was beautiful.  All staff members are truly excellent- friendly and concerned that each item is tasteful and everything is wonderful.,5
"We met friends for New Years eve.  Sat. Down before reservation, waitress was good.  We were in the bar area, the food was great.",5
Food was great but our waitress was not very friendly at all,5
We had an awesome experience.  They placed us in the booth closest to the front door.  That is my only complaint.  It was a cold weather evening and we could feel a cold draft the whole time.  Our server was so nice...and the Desert they brought out for our Twin's Birthday was so yummy!  It was early on a Friday evening so it wasn't as crowded as I'm sure it could be.  Which kept the noise level at a nice level since we have a daughter with Autism and sometimes Loud situations can bother her.  I didn't mark Quick Bite because it seems more like a place to be able to relax and enjoy the surroundings.  People who are looking for a quick bite would be better going fast food...or Bob Evan's.   Thank you again for a wonderful experience.,5
"Reservation table in the bar area was waiting for us, service excellent, food was go...especially the gnocchi in the trio and the wedding soup ",5
very friendly and they do a large carryout business for pick up...check it out,5
Birthday always a wonderful experience we love it there,5
Food was delicious and service was terrific.  This is one of the friendliest restaurants we have ever visited.  The entire staff is very gracious.  The entrees have a great presentation and taste as delicious as they look..,5
"Excellent food, service and atmosphere.  Nikki was a splendid server.  She was very efficient and pleasant.  Entrees were very tasteful and presentation was great.",5
"Our family went to Giammarco's to celebrate our mother's 90th birthday.  The food was great and our server, Cookie, was awesome!  She made Mom feel special and our night a lot of fun.  I would highly recommend this restaurant.",5
"Most of the party has veal parmesean which was good,  the sauce was great.  I ordered the shrimp and lobster ravioli, it was ok, very fishy tasting, so probably won't get that again, but we will be back to dine again.",4
"Excellent pasta, Stromboli and salad.  Service was terrific.  Server Cookie was definitely great and very efficient.",5
"It was a please evening by.  Great food, wine and service",5
"I've been to the Wine Bistro In Upper Arlington and Clintonville (now closed). However, this time I went to Westerville and was disappointed in the service.  I felt like my guest and I were ignored once we decided not to buy a bottle of wine.    I will most likely go back to the UA Wine Bistro, but not Westerville.  The server was inattentive.",5
We always enjoy our nights out at the wine bistro Westerville location. Stacy took great care of us!,5
Food  could have been a little faster coming out of kitchen  but we didn’t mind to much because the restaurant was busy and service was attentive.,4
It's a very nice and enjoyable place to spend an evening. Highly recommended!,5
"The service was great, the food was delicious, and the wine was very tasty.",4
Dinner was so good the other night we decided to try lunch. Highly recommend the blank and blank option which is only available till 4pm. Our sever Jenna was great!,5
Greatly enjoyed our evening at the Westerville wine bistro. Food was fabulous and service was excellent! Already booked our next reservation!,4
"Very good food. Amazing selection of wine as well. Price was a little high on food portions but still very good food. Very good deal for a bottle of wine on Monday's and Tuesday's other than that should just stick to a flight, or glass of wine.",3
Good food and service,5
We enjoy going to the Wine Bistro on a lark and always enjoy the food and drink.,5
Slow kitchen. Noisy space. Overworked wait staff,5
This is the second time this month we have been to the Wine Bistro. The restaurant is really nice but the service was lacking and incredibly slow both times. The waitress failed to inform us of an $8 corkage fee for when buying a bottle. We ordered an item to go (gluten Free pizza) and it was barely cooked.,5
Awesome automosphere and food-service was not great but it could have been worse.,3
Service and atmosphere was great. Had the flatbread that was a little more on the crispier side of doneness but still a good experience,2
I feel I would only go there for special occasions since its pricey.  I wouldn't make it a regular place.,1
"I love it and everything was great, but after 2 drinks, an app, side salad and cup of soup, plus tip it was 52.00.  Maybe that's typical, I usually don't pay, my husband does, so maybe I'm out of touch.",2
"Went for Restaurant Week, excellent choices for $25, 3-course meal. Delicious and welll-prepared. Good selection of red wine with both flights. Veal meatball is large, well seasoned and enough to share. Excellent service provided by Abby! Also all courses were brought to us by several servers, so no one had to wait.",5
Good food and service,5
The nose level was so high it was incredibly difficult to carry on a conversation (and the restaurant was busy but not completely full). ,4
"I have to say, I'd take sub-par meal with excellent, courteous service over a five-star meal with poor service any day.  I sure hope they get their service figured out, because the location is just so great.",4
"Restaurant Week great food. I would definitely do it again . I would  for sure come back for happy hour . I love that they're happy hours every day. Food was very good and large portions.  Definitely worth the value. Everything that we saw, coming of out the kitchen looked great",4
"The restaurant had inexperienced servers .  The noise from the bar area was really loud, making conversation hard at times.  The food portion were really large for a restaurant week meal-which was great.  The menu selection was large-making one wonder how they could be proficient at all offerings.  The view from the window overlooking the golf course was very pretty.",4
"Went for restaurant week.  Won't be back.  Sauce with crab cakes so hot blew out my taste buds, hubs couldn't eat it either. Sand wedge salad huge and drenched in dressing. Walleye under seasoned and had to request lemon. Not sure what the sauce was that came with the steak  (steak was good)  sauce tastes like an unseasoned white sauce that was frothy. Carrot cake was odd, over an inch of super stiff frosting in between layers of cake.  Nibbled at the cake and left the frosting.  Ice cream was good.",5
Great Nightly Specials,5
"We had friends in from out of town on Wednesday evening and they wanted to try the Pub & Grill at Prestwick. We had a 7:00 reservation and our first observation was that the restaurant was very loud, as it was difficult to hear each other talk at the table. We ordered drinks and the waitress came back about 15 minutes later and asked if we were ready to order food. We asked about our drink order and she apologized, saying she forgot to put it in. Then it took another 10 minutes to get the drinks! We should have ordered the food because she had disappeared while we were waiting. Finally she returned and she apologized again, then took our food order. About 35-40 minutes later a manager came over to our table and apologized again and she told us that the waitress had forgot to put our food order in, and that they would rush our food out as quickly as they could. She offered us a round of drinks or she said she could discount the food bill. In the end we're not sure what the issue was with the waitress, she was very friendly, but certainly she failed with our table. Perhaps they were under staffed that evening. Overall, the food was good, but the service was very disappointing.",5
Consistently positive experience with food and atmosphere.,4
Father's Day,3
"Enjoyed the restaurant, food was good, service was good.  The patio was very nice to sit on and watch the golfers finish their rounds, it was a very nice atmosphere.",4
"I had reservations for mothers day lunch.  I was disappointed that they were serving brunch only, thus my review could never be  positive. $25.00 for their brunch not worth it. ",4
Best part of brunch for me was the shrimp and beef dish.,1
"Desserts were weak.  Coffee very good, but I had to ask if they were serving coffee and also had to ask for refill..  I don't believe wait staff was trained very well or supervised very well.",4
"Picked this place for Mother's Day brunch. The people were nice, and the food was good though I wouldn't go out of my way for brunch again ($32.50/person before drinks).",4
Food was delicious and service was fast.  Very friendly staff.,2
"Busy Friday night, so we had to wait 30-45 minutes to get a table out side and initial service was a bit slow.  Burger, Reuben and turkey wrap and fries were all tasty and hot.  Not bad for a newer restaurant.",5
"Stopped in for lunch and drinks - everything was fantastic.  This is a very relaxing and inviting place.  Past owners have not had the best luck, so hopefully T. Morris will be a success.  Can't wait to check out the dinner menu.",4
"The host/manager was not welcoming. He didn't smile. We weren't impressed. Our waitress was the same, she didn't smile once! What was right with this restaurant was the delicious food. My bone in New York strip and potatoes were excellent! My husband's crab legs were good, but a lot of work with all the leg cracking. Our friends had lobster mac and cheese, lobster bisque, fried shrimp and fries which they said was very good.",5
"Food was great. Service was good. Beware, however, if you have a Groupon or daily deal the restaurant will mark any specials (happy hour drinks, appetizers, etc.) up to full price without telling you.",1
Great food and great service. We typically go here during boating season but decided to head here in the winter. Great decision!,2
Love this place great food great service and fantastic value.,1
We made reservation but still had to wait 20 minutes. Staff very accommodating.,1
Food taste excellent. Must try this place for tasty food.,3
Ambiance lacking. Music a bit loud.,3
Price OK.,1
"Everything was wonderful.  Jackie, our waitress, was outstanding.  Food was great.  Can't wait to go back for more",2
"We reallyenjoyed the Thanskgiving dinner. We were at the last seating of the day, and had to wait a few extra minutes for the previous diners to finish up. But, with the exception of there being no dark meat left, there was plenty of food available. We enjoyed the family style service, and everyone was very friendly and helpful. We will definitely go back again.",2
"We went for Thanksgiving and the food was past amazing!  Wonderful staff, a great view and time with our family made for a perfect day.",2
For those of us who don't prepare a Thanksgiving meal at home Mallard's is the perfect place to go. We have gone here for the last four Thanksgivings and would highly recommend it. All the food you want is served family style and there is a dessert bar.  If you like traditional Thanksgiving fare this the place to go; tastes just like mom prepared it and no clean-up!,2
"Waited 25 minutes past our reservation time to be seated while walk-ins were seated ahead of us. Food was good, but not exceptional.",4
"The fish and chips were good, fried golden and not brown and burnt like some places.  It was all you can crab legs that night so it was very busy so we'll choose a different night next time unless we want crab legs cuz they were serving them on heaping platters!",4
"The host was very nice, comped my drink when my date didn't show, the service was wonderful and they fulfilled my request for a quiet table overlooking the river.",4
"We went for brunch and the kitchen got backed up from many parties ordering at once, but the wait staff was super sweet. They were checking in and letting us know what was taking time. Our toddler’s soup came out first and early so the wait wasn’t terrible. The food was quite good and the desserts they offered for the wait were great.",4
"Took the boyfriend to Mallards on his birthday. Made reservations but that ended up being unnecessary as it was a Tuesday at 2pm so literally there was one other party of 2 and us. The place was empty. Haha. Our server was super courteous and helpful with the menu. I had the Steak Alfredo which was absolutely delicious. Boyfriend had the fish and chips and said it was really good too. The place has a very nice lake view. When we told the server it was my boyfriend's birthday, he offered to give us free dessert which was way nice of him. We got their New Orleans Beignets to go and sweet Jesus, they were simply AH-mazing. Very positive experience.",5
"We tried the Prime Rib Special - taste was good and price reasonably. The restaurant has great of the St. Croix river and is handicapped accessible. Lastly, the hostess and wait staff were friendly!",5
"For the last few months whenever I've gone here it has been disappointing.  We've received extremely slow service from the kitchen, it appears they are short staffed for servers, and it's eventually followed up by just so-so food.  I believe, ultimately, this is the result of poor management/ownership.",5
"The last time we were there, after 1.5 hours we had received one beverage, no water refills, and only the salad/soup first course.  Don't go to Mallards unless you have all the time in the world and are ok with mediocre food.",5
Great views of the river and marina. Great Sunday afternoon cruise along the river and dinner at Mallards! My wife had fish n chips (cod) and I had shrimp. Loved the fall colors and the view of the river.,4
"Arrived on time for reservation but they said they would be able to seat us in the dining room for at least 20-30 minutes. We opted to sit on their covered deck (with plastic sheeting covering the screened windows) and it was freezing. Loud music was playing there too. Really not the type of atmosphere I was hoping for. I wonder what was the point of having a reservation if we needed to wait 30 minutes for a table in the dining room? Server was attentive, good was decent. We certainly won't be back.",4
Awesome place - great food!  View of the river is breathtaking.,4
Our server made the evening wonderful!,5
"Great place, can be a little pricy, but a great part of the new york scene, huge operation.",5
Too much black pepper on filet mignon. Could not taste meat almost at all,5
Great place to eat and to soak up the atmosphere of the city. Very vibrant bar and scene. Wonderful service and food. The best.,4
"food was ok nothing you couldn't do at home. It was way over priced, but the cheesecake was very good.",5
32oz Longbone Ribeye was excellent,5
"Food was excellent, everyone at the table was content! Wine list great and service very good. All together very happy with our experience.",4
Absolutely the best steak in Manhattan. The only area of improvement I would recommend is finding ways to reduce the decibel level - just a little. :-),4
"It's not cheap, so just make your peace with that. Once you do, sit back, relax for two hours and really enjoy an outstanding experience. We go every year for my birthday and everything from the appetizers to the desserts is exceptional every time.",3
"Consistently impressed. Service is great, food is fantastic, ambiance is lovely. The price limits it to a special occasions only place for us, but is by no means unreasonable. We often look for special occasions we can celebrate at Del Friscos.",4
"The food was very good but we were a bit disappointed. The DelFrisco website said that they still had the pre-fixed/pre-theater menu that included a salad, entree and dessert - but when we got to our table our waiter informed us that it included the entree and dessert only and that we needed to buy the salad separately, which we did. I'd still consider coming back, but without the old pre-fixed menu it is less likely.",4
We were very pleased with our experience. Great service!,5
We had a short time period for our luncheon meeting before our flight back to Tampa. The server was extraordinary in helping us have a productive meeting in a quiet section of the restaurant and catching our flight home.,4
I'm a regular here. But tonight steaks were especially salty. Not sure why.,5
"we wanted a great steakhouse on a one daytrip from Washington, D.C. Based on the reviews, I selected Del Frisco's and unfortunately, we were disappointed. The prices are outrageous which was expected but the food really did not live up to the hype. We ordered filet mignon on the bone at the recommendation of our waitress. And then all agreed that we have definitely eaten better steaks elsewhere: Peter Lugers, Ruth's Chris and the Capitol Grille all spring to mind. The asparagus side dish was absolutely inedible, wooden in fact, and I dont mean al dente. The chateau potatoes were just okay. The waitress asked us not to order the bread pudding because she had so many complaints. Is this really worth over $400 for a dinner for three?",5
Very nice atmosphere and the food was all delicious. Would definitely dine there again.,5
Our didning experience was incredible!,5
"From beginning to end this was a fabulous experience. The food is excellent and the ambience was classy. Expensive, but worth it for special ocassions.",5
"We've wanted to try this restaurant for awhile. Finally found a weeknight where we didn't have to wait. What a beautiful setting! Our meal was delicious, and the upside down apple pie was scrumptious! Would definitely go again..with friends!",3
"The waygu sirloin entree was excellent. The original bread basket was excellent. My friend loved her white fish, but the rice that came with it was totally plain, kind of disappointing. The carrot cake was very good and huge. Also very good wine prices.",3
"Excellent food, wine and service. Definitely on my recommendation to friends. Will return soon.",2
Excellent time. Great views. Lisa was a superb server.,3
Had both lunch and dinner around a round of golf. Enjoyed both meals. Outstanding view of the surrounding area.,3
The outside seating made this meal.  Our service was great.  Our food was ok.  It wasn't bad by any means it was just pricey and not spectacular.  We would return for the view but just make different food choices.,3
"Our first visit. Menu is not exciting, but I had the salmon & it was the most delicious salmon dish I have had in a long time. My spouse got irritated w the server. Ordered wine for dinner before our appetizer came & dinner was served & still NO wine. She was oblivious & tried to make excuses but there was no reason it should not have been there.  pls advise servers that wine should be on table before dinner is placed.",4
We enjoyed the great view and the décor of the restaurant. The food was delicious and the service was very good.,3
Went here for our anniversary as we had not been here before. Had the Prime Rib special which was very good and my wife had a very nice salad. We sat out on the veranda which was perfect. Great place for dinner or drinks as it has a very nice view. I think in the fall it would be spectacular.  Service was also quite good. We will definitely go back.,4
"The service is fantastic; the meat was a bit salty and tough, though.  But all things considered, a good value and a pleasant respite.",3
The food fantastic ,5
 The service impeccable ,4
 The noise level unbearable loud,4
"Pros:  beautiful view, excellent carrot cake, seated right away (had reservation), lovely outdoor seating",4
"Cons:  phone system prevents contacting restaurant,  burnt onion aioli did not seem correctly labeled, wished the waygu beef had had some grill/char flavor, baked potato was very sub-par being dry potato with blue cheese crumbles on top, whitefish was dry",2
"This is our 4th visit, twice great service, twice horrible service. ",3
I had the burger with pepper jam & bacon. Delicious! ,2
"Our food tasted good, but 3/5 dishes were cold. I love the menu, there's more I want to try,  so we will go back, but we will request different servers.",1
"Our experience was delightful.  Great ambiance, great drinks and fantastic food.  Our waitress was very attentive to our needs.  Wonderful place for a family or friends gathering.  Will definitely be back.",2
"Great service, good food.  Nice weeknight getaway.  Fantastic views!",3
Happy this restaurant is here. Consistently great food and lots of it. Will be back!,5
Newly reopened and rebranded our experience was a breath of fresh air.!,4
"We will not be back. One person's order came out 15 minutes before everyone else's food. The food was not good. The pizza was basic tomato sauce, not pizza sauce. The sauce on the burgers was good, but almost non-existent. The prime rib had a string in it and was not a great cut. Service was slow and inconsistent. The server was a kid and very friendly, but clueless. The drinks were weak and so-so. Many other fine places to choose from in Woodbury. Just skip this place.",4
Food was tasty - wait staff very agreeable.  Loved the sweet potato tater tots.,5
"Awesome food, I wouldn't order cocktails unless Terri or Larry are working but great beer and wine selections, food is phenomenal great selections for whatever your hungry for.",5
Hoping to see better service on our third visit.  Food was great and will definitely go back!,4
"The food was pretty good, not exceptional.  The noise level was astronomical, maybe because of rowdy people or nothing to absorb any noise.  Would be willing to try it again.",4
"As the people at the table next to us were very loud, it was difficult for our friends and us communicate. Not the the restaurant’s fault, but disappointing. As always, food and service were good, the view great, we like Mallard’s.",4
"Overall, the experience was good. The food tasted delicious, the servers were friendly and kind, and the atmosphere was welcoming.",4
"Very relaxed, good food, great ambience. Be sure to make reservations. There is outdoor seating if the weather is agreeable. Very busy when it's nice weather. Homey feel but still can be elegant enough for a special celebration.",4
Amber was our server she was exceptional. Very friendly and her table side manner is on point made our evening more inviting. The food was great too!. We will be back for sure.,4
"Noise level inside was way too high. We dined outside, had our own little patio, and it was great! Good view, interesting menu, quiet. However, server was either inexperienced, or untrained, or ill suited for the job. That sort of spoiled dinner for us. She left out a lot of questions--such as, "" would you like an appetizer or salad?""  ""Would you care for dessert? "" Etc. our wine arrived during the main course--not before-- and, by the time she managed to get the bottle opened, at least one of us was finished with the main course. Sadly, it was the person who had ordered the bottle of wine, which effectively spoiled his meal.",3
"Very nice place for a quiet couple's birthday dinner, excellent food, clean, and wonderful outdoor view",4
"Based on previous reviews, we had low expectations so we were not surprised.  Service was slow.  The first bottle of wine we ordered we were informed after several minutes was not available.  My husband's filet was overdone.  I had the shrimp & grits which was very tasty.  The restaurant has a great view but is very spartan.  A cozier lodge feel would be more appropriate for the setting.  We will return, but only for drinks or maybe lunch in the fall to see the fall colors.",4
Food was ok. Had to ask twice for butter. Also had to ask for bread - does not come with the meal unless you ask. Beautiful view but the service could have been better. We drove 1 hr and 15 minutes to the restaurant because we heard it was really good. If it was closer we might try it again but we would not drive over an hour to come back.,4
"Food was excellent.  Service was acceptable, but not exceptional.  Wine list definitely needs attention.",5
"WONDERFUL food! We are excited to go back! When it's busy it is a little loud for conversations across the table. Window seats have been hard for us to get with reservations, whether it's busy or empty. The food is very yummy!!! Can't get back there soon enough! Thank you for bringing us exceptional food in our area!",4
Great food  nice music,5
"Service was friendly, efficient but not rushed.  Hanger steak was tender and cooked to perfection.  Salmon also done exceptionally well.  We split an appetizer - eggplant rollatini - which was tasty and served on two plates.  Live music in the bar area, but not overwhelming in the dining area.",3
Filet was raw in the middle after ordering medium. The other courses were very good.,3
"Best italian restaurant in Metuchen and the whole area. Wonderful, freshly made pastas and salads.",4
"Besides parking, it is always a great experience, mainly because the staff is gracious and attentive.",3
"Unfortunately a lot of problems with the food, but owner was wonderful and fixed everything. He couldn’t have been nicer to us.",5
Friendly and nice but Not accommodating manager/owner.,4
Nice atmosphere - small servings and pricey for average Italian food. Would go back only for bar / music,2
"Enjoyable dinner. The meatball appetizer was great, the pastas are fresh and delicious. I especailly loved the Caramel Maple budino- it was the star of the meal. We'll return for sure.",4
Great selection of appetizers and pastas to share. Incredible wine list to pair with your food choices. Friendly and attentive service that never makes you feel rushed.,4
Wonderful restaurant with excellent food and service!! Looking forward to our next visit.,2
What a fantastic meal all four of us had at Novita!  From appetizers to desserts we were all so thrilled with the quality and taste! Two of us tried the Porchetta Wednesday menu and it was truly wonderful and you can't beat the price.   And to top it off our server Oscar was so fabulous. ,4
His suggestions for wine and menu were right on point and he was so attentive.  We all are truly ,5
in love with Novita and would recommend to all.,5
Good food coupled with excellent service add up to a great dining choice for lunch or dinner.,5
"Great lunch spot, and the food is superb. Have to make it for dinner soon!",3
"Food was good, the service was not so good!  The waiter took out drink order, and than when it came to the bar it remained on the bar till we almost has to get it ourselves. The waiter was not very attentive, and the wait staff seemed as thought they may have been new,, however the waiter should really be more attentive to his guest.. Drinks were pricey, but food ok, cauliflower soap was tasteless, we returned it.. through a bus staff, the waiter no where to be seen",3
Excellent as always we have never been disappointed,5
Tasteless food and a wierd decor that is attempting to be fine dining.,3

Always an enjoyable time.,2
Not sure if there is a dress code but it made it feel more like a pub than a upscale restaurant.  Could be because there was a festival going on or not. The food was great and so was the service.,3
Another yummy meal at Novitas.  Sausage and mussel appt is superb....bronzino always amazing....great wine list. Wonderful attentive service...and then there is George in the piano....awesom food and vibe...go right now...,3
This place is so good!!!! I eat here once a week for business lunches and come here from time to tom at night. Very very very good!!!,1
Great location & ambiance... soft piano music playing all night. Our table was ready on time and even gave a prompt phone call just before we walked in. Awesome experience for our Date Night.,4
It was great,4
We enjoyed delicious paninis in the lounge. Very comfortable environment and a very accommodating and courteous staff. Would definitely visit again.,4
"Great food, great ambiance",4
I enjoyed a business dinner here recently. The food was authentic Italian and the service was impeccable. 5 stars for everything!  WELL DONE SIR.,4
Hands down our favorite restaurant in central NJ. Friendliest and most attentive staff I've ever encountered. Great entertainment. Especially Lou.,4
It was a great lunch and great food,5
"Great place with live music in Saturday night , a good menu of beverages and wines .. being a vegetarian very little options however the server was able to help us customize some of the dishes but would have loved to see more veggie options for next time",5
I would have to make specific mention of the quality of the food.  The restaurant claims that they make everything handmade from the bread to the cheese to the pasta.  This is a claim that I could not verify with my eyes but definitely with my taste buds.  WOW!  Excellent quality food across the spectrum from the fish to the meatballs to the cheeses to the pasta to the bread.  And what bread it is... A wonderful dining experience with great service.  Delicious... we will definitely be going back soon.,5
"Food is very good. Only reason I was upset is that OpenTable reservations are sent to the 'dining-only' side of the restaurant, which has a different menu entirely from the bar-menu. The bar-menu is delicious and has great dishes. The dinner-menu is more so fancy, expensive dishes in small portions. ",5
"I highly recommend going, but try out the bar side!",5
"Great Birthday dinner for my husband,  wonderful service and nice surprise that it was restaurant week making it a great value.",5
Thoughtful selection of items prepared with expertise.  Swanky feel makes it worthy of an occasion but also nice for friends gathering.,5
"My wife and I have eaten here a few times and had a great experience every time until Saturday night. We took a friend from out of town and had a 6:30 reservation. The hostess sat us at a table in the ""lounge"" area, near the music. We told her we were having dinner then wanted to stay for the music. ",5
"The table was right by a door that the hostess kept opening, so almost all the women were wearing coats while they were eating.",5
"Our food was good. I had the $49 four-course dinner with a main course of salmon. My wife enjoyed her bronzini. Our friend had the stuffed pork, which he thought was greasy and was made with too much olive oil. ",5
We had cocktails and a bottle of wine  and our total bill was about $260.00.,4
"We were surprised, when at 8:35, half-way through dessert, the hostess came to the table and told us to ""move on"", as she had a 8:30 reservation for our table. We finished-up in about 10 minutes and left. When we were leaving we noticed many empty tables on the ""restaurant""  side.",3
Our friend and us were disappointed as we would have liked to have an after dinner drink while enjoying the music on a Saturday night. The hostess really needs some customer satisfaction training.,4
This Friday we will be going to Torino 2 in Metuchen instead of Novita.,2
"Thank you, Carlo and Staff!  You did it again, my friend!! BT & JT",5
Overall good food and vibe with a great piano played. I was disappointed with our waitress who forgot to give me my wine (and had to be reminded),5
"Food was excellent!  Our waiter was awful!  My husband and I sat in the dining area we usually sit in the lounge area, I have never had a problem there. The waiter was arrogant and dismisive, he was nice to the elderly couple sitting in front of us who were regulars.  Even lied to us about the specials when we over heard him recite them to another table. We had to flag him down for dessert after 15 minutes.  I still tipped 20% because the rest of the staff was nice and the food was good.  Would never sit if he was the server ever again.  It was a shame, put my dog down on Valentine's and this was our belated outing.  All dressed up to be treated poorly",5
Went to Novita for a late Valentine's Day celebration. The experience was awful. We were seated,5
"right away, but after that it took Forever until someone showed up to take our drink order.",3
"The atmosphere is lovely, but the food is way OVERPRICED, and portions are small. The menu is",4
"extremely limited.  Staff is basically invisible, and it feels as if you are sitting on top of the person next to you.",1
My girlfriend and I could barely hear each other talk.  So No I would say save your money and try somewhere else.,3
"We enjoyed the open kitchen, and the friendly vibe of the staff was extraordinary. #Cynthia.....The food was to die for. I would visit Heirloom weekly.  Can not wait to return!",5
We live an hour away from Heirloom Kitchen but decided to give it a try based on several articles written.  We were not disappointed and I would even say they exceeded our expectations.  Everything on the menu is absolutely delicious and cooked to perfection.  The service was tremendous as well.  I have nothing to criticize and everything to rave about.  We will be back!,5
"First time at Heirloom. Read reviews which were outstanding. I thought the service was exceptional and friendly. The staff was knowledgable and politie. The timing of appetizers to main course was somewhat long but they warned us about that due to individualization of parties and taking care of tables one at a time. However, as soon as the main course was completed we had a dessert menu placed on our table...it wold have been more relaxing to let us digest for a few minutes.",5
"The food was tasty,eclectic with wonderful presentation. However, I thought portions were small given the somewhat  high prices for appetizers and main courses. Would have liked more choices,especially on the main entrees.",5
"Would return but only on special occasions, not just for a night out. Thank you.",5
Shelly Ludwig M.D.,5
"Took my wife for a date night here. Became a night to remember. Consider this place - homie yet classy. Overall a great experience between the atmosphere, the great knowledgeable fun staff and delicious meal. Will definitely recommend this to anyone who’s looking for a new experience.",5
"If you ever visit, do ask for Cynthia. Best server ever!!",5
The food is absolutely wonderful from appetizers to dessert.  ,4
The staff is amazing. ,4
We will be back,5
"This was our second time there, and it was perfect. We tried something different than the first meal, and again, it exceeded expectations. I still can’t believe we have a place like this is NJ.",3
Love that this gem is right in our backyard!! The entire staff is beyond professional and always make us feel at home!,5
A can't miss for the NJ dining scene.,5
What a gem! Absolutely loved the experience! ,5
Will definitely come back also would like to take cooking lessons with a group of friends that’s should be a lot of fun!! Next time I want to sit at the table next to the chef. A must vitiligo restaurant!,5
The food was second to none. The staff was very attentive without being over bearing. I understand why reservations are needed well in advance. I can't wait to go for a refill. ,5
"If you like duck you really need to taste theirs, unbelievably good!",5
"Easily one of the best dining experiences in New Jersey.  The staff is warm and friendly.  The food is fantastic, definitely some of the best duck outside of China.  Kudos to the party chef as well; desert was superb.",5
"Unique culinary experience in NJ, absolutely enjoyed the whole experience. Server was funny and well versed on the menu, food was outstanding . Will definitely come back for dining and for the cooking classes",5
This place is unlike anything else. Worth the time to check out.,5
"My 22 year old daughter said “mom that was the best meal I ever had”.  I agree, the meal was great. The servers took their time and told us all about the dishes.  My daughter is allergic to nuts. They made alterations to accommodate her. The owner stopped over and spoke to us. Lovely place. Great food. Wonderful service.",5
"My husband and I decided to celebrate my son’s 10th birthday in Heirloom Kitchen. He loves everything  a cool chef , delicious food and a nice place.",5
 He just said  “ mom I will never forget this experience” .,5
"Thank you , Heirloom kitchen xoxo🎈",5
"As always, Heirloom Kitchen was absolutely outstanding. The service, food and atmosphere are top notch and we cannot wait to go back again.",5
"Everything is amazing - from the food to the service it is unmatched. The open kitchen allows you to watch the food being prepared while you eat. Perfect for date night. Although it is pricey, you are getting what you pay for. Not to mention it is decorated beautifully.",5
"Second time there, this time celebrating the new year a day early...everything outstanding again! Thanks and kudos!",5
"We love this place!  We had heard about it a while ago, but seeing as how it's only open Friday to Sunday, we had wait until we had an occasion that matched up with a weekend.  ",5
"The space filled up quickly on a very busy Holiday weekend and the service was not instantaneous considering the backlog, but absolutely everything from the salad to the small plates to the Main to the dessert was incredible.  The servers were attentive and professional, which means they are very well trained.",5
"Special kudos to our server, Cynthia, who was friendly, personable, knowledgeable, enthusiastic and funny.  We left feeling as though we had a new best friend, and I will ask to sit at one of Cynthia's tables when we return.",5
"Some may consider the menu ""pricey"" but terrific food that is carefully designed and well presented is worth every penny.",5
GREAT Classic Rock music mix (though it was a little on the loud side) made for great background.,5
"We already have plans to take some friends, and we're planning to do that soon!",5
Thanks for a terrific dining experience!,4
"Another very solid meal....the menu is alway changing which is one of the best parts about dining at Heirloom.  The service is always attentive, and paced perfectly....the fact that you can BYOB makes this a great choice....the dining room is clean and elegant and just a cool vibe.",5
Everything we ate was delicious. My biggest complaint would be the long wait between appetizers and the main course. I would advise being patient. The food is worth waiting for and the service was attentive. Next time I would like to sit at the chef’s table to see the action up close. Loved the casual vibe of the place!,5
Excellent food and service It was fun to watch the food being cooked,5
"Food was heavenly, service was top-notch.  It was our best dining experience possibly EVER. I have already made another reservation. Fantastic.",5
Atmosphere was warm & inviting. Food was excellent.  Service was impeccable.  There are not enough words to describe how fantastic the service was.  Will be back!,5
Amazing! Such a unique dining experience everyone should try it.,5
"Wonderfully prepared meal served hot, Noah our waiter was very attentive and personable.  Creative spin put on every dish. Can't wait to return!",5
Absolutely a gem!!! Such exquisite food and ambience!!! Love every time I come here!,5
"Well, I don't know what I expected but it wasn't what I expected...first, the food was ALL THAT...delicious, well prepared, well presented up and down (only the coffee was a lttle weak disappointingly). Being a big music fan, it was hard not to notice the eclectic and energetic playlist...""Search and Destroy"" by the Stooges is hardly what you'd imagine as dinner music but I loved it (wonder what the other guests thought?). The tables were like makeshift kitchen nook tables, wooden chairs...very open space with a very communal feel...not dark and stodgy at all...the glassware was noticeably spotless for our byob beverage, they had nice champagne glasses...they also served dessert wine that was WOW! but did not have proper pony glasses. Oh well...The service was very attentive from a team of servers that love what they do and obviously drink the HK Kool-Aid...our main server was VERY friendly and called us ""darlings"" ""loves"" ""dears"" and other terms of endearment which kind of fit in with the place but also just might turn you off...would go again to bring friends and enjoy a nice evening of culinary delights.",4
"I took my family here for my mother’s birthday. We’d always passed it and peeked in with the intention to try the menu. A top-tier gem hidden in suburbia, and I’m super happy we found it. Come here to really enjoy the experience, not to chow down and leave. Wonderful ambiance and playlists for great conversation.",5
"We’d seen Heirloom Kitchen on the best ten list from Open Table and were curious since we’d never heard of it. This small restaurant is only open weekends, and we finally got in on a Sunday. Initially I was disappointed that a menu item I’d seen online and was planning to order - Toasted Fettuccini with a Wild Boar ragu - wasn’t available. We started with the Fall Thompson Green Salad, so different, with apples, persimmon, cashews, and a delicate shallot vinaigrette. We both ended up getting the Pork Wellington as our mains, and as promised by the lovely wait staff, made me forget completely about that unavailable fettuccine. While it is the most expensive dish on the menu, it was outstanding. With sweet potatoes , mushrooms and bacon, the tender,  juicy pork dish is one we look forward to ordering again. We met and thanked co-owner and Chef David Viana, as personable and down-to-earth as he could be, considering his impressive previous training and posts. The only small complaint I have is, they could use a better ventilation system. That said, we will be back, and we plan to bring friends! (And wine-  while they do sell bottles from the California winery Dominico, you may also BYOB).",5
Amazing personalized dining experience.  Food was amazing - ambience very cool.  definitely will be back!,5
"Amazing and interesting food, friendly and knowledgeable staff...foodie’s paradise.  Our favorite place in central jersey.",5
"Food was mostly memorable. Especially the current fettuccine dish. Also the duck was amazing. The risotto served with the duck was underseasoned and forgettable. The desserts were one hit and one big miss. The Ube tart was not good. The pavlova was wonderful. Plating on the desserts were messy, and not in a good rustic sort of way. The wine was delicious and extremely  affordable. Tuna carpaccio was a big hit. Bread was nice but lacked salt and a little dense. Overall it was a place to return to. 75% of the meal was on point. The service was attentive and awesome. Entrees are a little pricey for the area and the portion. Great date night or special occasion spot.",5
"Unique restaurant, outstanding food, and GREAT ATTENTION TO DETAIL.",5
"Loved the ambiance, funky vibe in a neighborhood where you’d least expect it.  The food and service were top notch, although it did take way too long for entrees to come.  They apologized and comped dessert, which was just okay by the way.  I’d still return.",5
"atmosphere is very pleasant.  great music played.  service was excellent; attentive, amusing, knowledgable & informative.  food was excellent, including small tasting dishes gratis.",5
Thrilled to have a creative farm to table restaurant in near vicinity to my home.  Had a wonderful dining experience with great service and fabulous food!,5
This is a Manhattan dining experience in NJ....excellent food and staff.,4
Spectacular. A few cuts above a sea of ordinary.,5
"We read an excellent review in the Star Ledger recently and made Heirloom Kitchen one of our destination as foodies! They did not disappoint, from the service, delicious dinner and dessert we will be returning. It's worth the drive as we live in Millburn NJ.",4
"The food was delicious, the atmosphere was quiet, and the service was wonderful!",5
Always amazing food and service!,5
Service not as good as usual.  It seems they were understaffed and overcrowded and were unable to handle it. It was also the loudest meal I’ve had there. Some people are just very inconsiderate and act as if they’re in their own backyard.,5
Great food and excellent service!,5
Location can be deceiving!   Worth the trip.......,5
JUST is usually spot on wonderful but this last time there the duck was impossible to eat.  That's a shame because I brought Mom for her first time there and her 80th birthday.   They eventually took it off the bill but with way too much hesitation and annoyance.  Might be a very long time before I go back to what was one of my favorite restaurants.,5
It was packed. — but that’s because the word is out on how great the food and the drinks are.  We will definitely come back to JUST.,5
Food was very good ambience very nice service was OK they had to be reminded what we ordered and even failed to bring something to us and was put on our bill. We Should have checked the bill instead of just paying it,4
Fabulous!  Didn’t try it for years because of the er....uh... “window dressing”.   We didn’t want to eat behind a gas station!  But I’m really glad we did.  Met friends for a birthday meal.  My wife and friend had a pink thing for drinks. Some delicious grapefruit thing.  My pal and I kept it simple:  a fine red Malbec.  ,4
Starters were delicious!   Calamari.  A Beef thingy.  Peking duck tacos.  Wow.  Pretzel bread?  Wow. ,3
I had the lobster special w papardelle ,3
My wife’s fish was delish.  ,3
And our friends had the fried chicken and lamb shank respectively (both mahvelous).,5
Dessert.  Coffee.  All amazing.,5
Excellent restaurant with fusion food. A bit upscale but outstanding service.,5
"The dishes are full of flavor, and eclectic menu offering fare for most mature pallets.   Nice atmosphere and décor, great for both a date or gathering.   Service was excellent.  Reservations recommended especially for weekends (full house on Sat night) since space is cozy.",5
"Great menu with lots of interesting choices. We were 2 couples & shared the scallops & the tuna cone appetizers-both excellent!  All entrees were not only delicious, they were also plentiful portions with great plated presentation. Thumbs up for the Australian Lamb Chops-perfectly cooked Med-rare with a tasty Demi-glaze  and served with fresh (not over cooked) spinach & carrots. Also a winner, the Volcano seared Tuna-it has a spicy kick! And the Garlic Short ribs-very tender.  Do Not miss the mini cinnamon donuts...light, crunchy and served hot in an adorable mini grocery cart!!",2
Food is SPECTACULAR! You will NOT be disappointed! We cannot wait to go back!,4
"everything was delicious!  The drinks were great, the service was a little slow,  but nothing that took away from the experience.  love going there!",5
"I wanted to like this place based on the reviews. The service was pleasant, however, everything was below the level it should have been considering the high prices.  The food was decent, but kind of bland, except for the short ribs,  dishes sat for a while  on the table after we had finished eating, and the music was too loud, like a dance club. Also, I was asked four times (once on the phone and three times by different individuals at the restaurant) if this was a special occasion, which it was. I am not sure why they asked as they did not do anything special about it.  Why not just ask once and inform the server.  ",3
I think people can find tastier food at other restaurants that are less pricey.,5
"Great local restaurant that uses a range of cuisines and fusion techniques to create amazing dishes. The wait staff is well trained and very knowledgable about the menu, ingredients and flavor profile.",4
Delicious just like we remembered! Spectacular service and unique spins on traditional dishes. Refreshing dinner.,5
I took my wife there for date night.  The food was better than you get at any of the chain restaurants and so was the bill at the end.,5
The food was fresh and delicious and the service was outstanding. Get the beet salad!!!,5
It was our first time here and we liked it. The duck tacos were crunchy skinned which was cool but maybe a corn taco instead of the sticky flour one? We also had the soup which was delicious and a cool table presentation.,4
Service was excellent ......Menu exceptional ....food delicious,4
"The food is consistently delicious and love that it changes seasonally.  A little too pricey to dine here often, but always come for birthdays and anniversaries.",4
New Years Eve dinner was outstanding!,3
Went for early news years dinner.It was excellent have been there before never disappointed.The menu is so elcetic.You can't categorize it it's so different and sooo good.Will be back again and again.,3
What a disappointment. The food was less than mediocre. My friend ordered the fillet medium rare and it was dry. The waitress was very nice but she doesn’t control the kitchen.,5
"We and family of ours celebrated our wedding anniversaries last night at JUST.  We were very pleased with our entire experience.  The food was amazing from the starters to our dessert.  If you're looking for a place to celebrate a special occasion, you can't go wrong with JUST.",4
"Hidden gem with an eclectic but balanced menu. The Peking Duck Taco starter was especially good, as was the pork belly. The Australian lamb chops were perfectly cooked and seasoned. I could have used some seasoning on the vegetables though. But I'm pleasantly surprised that everything wasn't overly salty in general, as many restaurants tend to do.",4
Awesome!!  Wait staff very pleasant and informative!!!,4
"Review based on dining at the bar Food was ok . I wouldn’t go out of my way to dine here. Ordered cod tacos, short rib tacos and steak skewers .. out of the three the steak skewer was small and the better of the three.. Drinks were ok .. In my opinion it was a Waste of $70.00 ..",5
"As usual, the food and service were outstanding. This is an upscale restaurant as good for special occasions as casual dining.",5
"Great food selection & solid service from our waiter, Dave.     Tricky entrance off Rt 9.   Pull into the BP gas station and you'll figure it out",5
"Service was excellent, and the food was very good.  Menu was somewhat limited but what we ate was very good. I would recommend a try.",5
I LOVED everything about JUST. The food was amazing and theservice was impeccable!!!,5
"Just when I thought customer service was a thing of the past Just Restaurant  exceeded my expectation! Just is a hidden gem. The ambiance was stellar, food was excellent hats off to the chef, and service was superb. I can't wait to return planning my next visit.",5
"Outstanding scallops, duck tacos, great version of butternut squash soup, excellent veggies.  Definitely will visit again.",4
Excellent food and superb service. We’ll be back.,5
food was very good! we went on a week night to avoid weekend crowd! very pleasant staff!,4
"Very quiet evening at JUST, as it was a Monday, so we received the royal treatment. Very quick, kind, polite and professional service, great menu and great food. Great decor, immaculately clean, nice atmosphere. Great place for a business lunch or a fun date.",5
Loved everything we ate.  great service too!  My Husband can't stop talking about how much he enjoyed his meal.  I just love the pretzel bread and the donuts for dessert.,4
"We were celebrating a birthday with three adults and one five-year-old child. Our server was extremely nice and very nice to the child. However he was either new or not very well-versed in restaurant fare and service.  We ordered Caesar salads and filet mignon for all three of us. We also ordered in advance the child’s meal which came very quickly and was very good. However, for the three of us, no bread was put on the table or offered, the salads were never brought to us until we asked for them, because the server thought they should come with the entrée and we explained to him that that is never the case. So he brought the salads out and upon putting them down on the table a person from the kitchen brought the three  entrées out. We refused them and said we were sending them back because we just got our salads which were quite large and needed to eat them first. The young man started to take them back but then came back and said he had to deliver them and we refused again. The manager came over and apologized and said he would have three new steaks fired for us and offered us either a round of wine or dessert on the house. We chose the desserts, which were excellent. We",5
" totally enjoyed our steaks and baked potatoes. They were cooked perfectly and served very nicely. The only issue was our server, who was really a very nice young guy. I’m sure the manager had a discussion with him, and we were sorry for that, but we tipped him extra because he was a good sport about the whole thing. We will definitely go back there again and have been there before eating outside on the patio.",5
"Service was good. Even though it was a good price, the Brunch  was a little scanty.",5
Brunch everything was cold including coffee. Omelette was only hot item as it was freshly made but over cooked. Water spots on dishes and glassware making look dirty. Will not return,5
"The brunch is delicious, a lot of options and the service is excellent.",2
Fantastic from start to finish. Both the food and the service were impeccable.,5
The restaurant is nice and clean.  The service was excellent and the food that our party of 6 had for lunch was plentiful and very good.  There were no negative experiences.  The staff was friendly and eager to please us.,2
Great evening. Good food and service.  Christopher our server was the best.,5
"We all had surf and turf specials.  It was a great value and all of the food was very good especially the filets that were all cooked perfectly.  Good wine, very nice atmosphere. Service could have been better, but overall a very good experience.",4
"Two burgers and two beers, $48 with tip.  Burger was good, but a 10 OZ burger is a little much.",3
Overpriced,1
The staff was friendly and accomodating. Food was great- nice place good variety!,3
"Great place for a first date. Jonathan, our server, was phenomenal and catered to all our whims. We'll be back very soon.",3
"The value of the oyster and shrimp special was amazing! Our server, Gabby, was exceptional, attentive and pleasant!",1
Found this restaurant by accident and so glad we did. We ate the Sesame Ahi Tuna that came with a rice cake. It was amazing to say the least. The mango martini was divine. Will definitely go back!!,5
"We had a great evening.  The food was very good, as was the just right service attention (not too much)!   The entertainment was fabulous and from 7:15 arrival we left at 11:45 to hear the cover band.  Look forward to my next visit.",5
"It was my first visit and I loved it.  The dinner was great, the atmosphere was wonderful. My waitress was very friendly.  Totally Awesome night!",5
"Service is slow. . .restaurant was busy.  More servers would probably help.  Very loud - sound system is awful!  There were singers who sounded even worse, since the sound system was so poor!  Bar was crowded and loud. . .sitting at a table in the restaurant was not much quieter.  Food was ok. . .wings needed more seasoning, but burger was great & fries were hot.  Another table was served a bread basket - but we were not offered one.  Not sure I'll be back at dinner, but may be willing to try some of the posted specials for lunch.  Music was was too loud!",5
"Food was mediocre at best.  Nice looking place but dirty, poor service.  Overall overpriced for what you receive.",5
Pleasant atmosphere and nice staff. Food is served pretty quick and is very tasty.,5
The food was goo,5
Everything was great. Our waiter was super believe his name was Mike. Fast service and funny.,5
"Great place, family enjoyed the private room. We would come again.",4
Chris was great!,4
Food and drinks were great. Had the french dip. My wife had the caprese salad and short ribs. Everything was great. Definitely go back,5
"This restaurant is attractive, run very well, and had excellent service, however, we found the food to be pretty average and were not wowed at all.  My pork chop was plain and a bit overcooked.   The potatoes and spinach that accompanied it were basic and ordinary, nothing to remember at all.   My husband's whole fish was good, but there were many bones (which is typical I suppose), but there wasn't any seasoning on it, nor was he given a lemon (he asked for and was given one).   Overall, it was an average dining experience and I would not run back or really recommend it to others.",5
"The Greek on Main is a wonderful dining experience. The food is prepared well, with satisfying portions. I’ve gone there for business meals and dinner with my family. There is somethig special about The Greek on Main a #1 choice for me.",5
Excellent For a first date. Amazing service. Delicious food,5
My husband and I first went to try Greek on Main during Metuchen restaurant week.  We loved it and went back a few times since last being for my birthday.  The food is excellent!  It's gourmet so fresh and delicious!!!  The service is always great and it's BYOB which is nice.  Every time we've had dinner there the chef will come to our table and ask how we liked everything which is such a personal touch.  Even if your picky to try different foods you will find something you will love on this menu!,2
"I Love this place. It was my first time there,  everyone in my party  enjoyed the food, the ambiance and the service was great.",3
Kudos to the entire staff!!!!!!!,4
Moussaka was subpar!,3
"I knew I was going to be with 5 other people at dinner, and to my surprise, the guest list was doubled and Greek on Main handled it beautifully and I was surprised.  Everyone thought their food was just perfectly prepared despite the number of people being served at once.  Portions were generous too.",5
"Only regret was that it was a long table against the wall, and as the restaurant was full and lively, a bit hard to talk to anyone not next to me.",5
Service was exceptional.  We ate and drank leisurely and were not rushed. Scallops and sausage appetizer was tasty. Flank steak was tender and Dover sole was done perfectly. Have been here often (also have done takeout) and will definitely come again.,5
First time and had a wonderful experience with outstanding food and service,5
Great octopus!  All the dishes were very tasty. We will go back.,5
Great place for Greek food..fresh fish and grill octopus the best..,5
"My friend and I had the Lamb shank with orzo which was tasty and the meat did fall off the bone.  My husband had the mousaka which wasn't heated through.  I should have had the mousaka.   My friend's husband had the pork chop which he devoured.  My friend and I had the fig ice cream which was great.  When I go back I would have a small plate and the ice cream, or an appetizer.",5
"we love this restaurant,  it reminds us of our vacation in Greece,  love the grill octopus ",5
"The only recommendations I would add, is to offer American coffee",5
We really love this place.  The staff is warm and friendly.,5
The food has been excellent.,5
"Food was edible, but eh - nothing to write home about... Service was horrendous - waitress was clueless not only on the menu, but also on what serving should be like. She wasn't rude or anything like that, but she acted completely idiotic. For example, I was chewing with my mouth full and there's still food on my plate, she comes over and asks me if I'm done with my meal. Don't know her name, but it was the older lady - she said it's her first week there. That explains why she doesn't know the menu, and I'm OK with that, but that doesn't mean she can completely lack common sense. Just ridiculous. We'll never be back.",5
"Delicious food. One of the best restaurants in Metuchen, NJ. The soup of the day is outstanding.",5
"Met some folks here as a central spot for all of us.  We have enjoyed our dinners here in the past and we were not disappointed PLUS our friends, from out of state, LOVED it!  They were not familiar with Greek cuisine, so to start, we just ordered several different appetizers and small plates...YUMMY!  We were also celebrating 2 birthdays of friends who had grown up together a long time ago.  The staff surprised us with pieces of cake to share, complete with birthday candles!  Very friendly and welcoming place, with great food!",5
I went to Greek on Main for lunch recently with my wife and daughter and had a pleasant experience overall as I was looking to try something different in the area. ,5
The location is nice and the restaurant is bright and welcoming inside. The service was stellar as we ended up testing the patience of our server more than we wanted to. ,5
"We strarted out with a wonderful appetizer of 3 cheeses which were served sizzling plate which was definitely the best of the food we ordered. We followed with the chicken souvlaki which was way over cooked and ended up replacing it with pork which was much better. We also had a steak gyro which was ok, but a little dry.  All were served with steak fries which were decent but could have been helped by some more spice. ",5
Always a great meal at Just! Fantastic food and excellent service as always. The Tuna Cones are a must!,5
Awesome food,5
Great service,5
"Hard to imagine a restaurant behind a gas station would be such an extraordinary find.  Aside from Restaurant Nicholas, i think its the best food in Monmouth County.  Very unique menu and from apps to desert,  it was almost perfect.  However because of the fact that the owners are absentee,  their is no one there with a vested interest that cares to insure you have an excellent dining experience. The staff is very young and inexperienced although professional.  Despite that flaw, i am looking forward to going bask asap.",5
Food good. Service not so good. Music annoying.,5
Pork loin on menu is actually a boneless pork chop.  It came out very over cooked.,4
ALWAYS A PLEASURE DINING HERE. THEY ARE LIKE FAMILY,5
"Everything they have is delicious, and ive been here quite a few times",5
Great food good atmosphere,5
Dan the server was great. Tried the dinner buffet and was pleased with the selection available. Next time will try menu items. Great meal.,4
"My mom love it for a Thursday night get together.  The kitchen is generally slow, but we spend the time socializing.",4
We dined here for my daughters 22nd birthday!!! ,3
Food was great! Service was great! Cocktails were awesome!!! One of the staff members sang Happy Birthday to my daughter and he was just awesome!!!,4
Definitely will go back to dine there!! Also great to just go for cocktails and apps!,2
"Birthday  Celebration for Mom - all of the guests enjoyed the occasion, food, service and ambiance!",4
Great food! Server was very attentive. Only downside was they were out of my first two choices when ordering. Want to try having brunch there though!,4
"The Creole Shrimp is such a great appetizer, I ordered it again entree size.",2
"We celebrated my sister's  birthday on a Friday evening , drinks, food a d atmosphere  was fantastic; the live vs d just added to the  celebration.  Everyone enjoyed the evening...we gave it 5 stars!",4
Waiter was EXCELLENT; food portions were HUGE.  Wish the tables lining the wall were all booth-style instead of tables.chairs.  I felt like I was sitting very close to the party of 12 next to me.,4
"I have passed this restaurant on many occasions and decided to give it a try with my wife and son.  Unfortunately, the service was just  ok.  The waiter did not seem as if he was there for the customers.  He really lacked customer service.",4
"In terms of the food, the French Onion Soup was GREAT! My wife's crab cake on the other hand was extremely mushy and salty.",4
Probably wouldn't recommend it.,5
I had been to Grillstone twice before and really enjoy the food. I got the salmon with spinach and mashed potatoes which I had gotten before and was happy to see that they had it on a lunch menu because I didn't want a whole dinner. I met 2 friends and we had an enjoyable time.  ,5
I was only disappointed that I could not use the 20% off coupon that I had on the lunch menu.,5
"My wife and I enjoyed our visit. Our server, Amanda, made our visit that much more pleasant.  Thanks Amanda!!!!!",4
"Considering most of the restaurants in a 10 mi. radius, Grillstone is upscale.  Good variety of dishes.  Many alternatives to steak. Food is fresh and well prepared. Good bar menu. Considering the location, is a bit pricey. Service is good, but do have to call server for help.",5
As mentioned the service was superb and our server was very accomidating when we pointed out the issues we had with the chicken. We also had a chat with the owner who was very friendly and clearly interested that his guests were happy. ,5
Overall I would definitely return as I'd love to try some of the dinner options available.,5
Food was very good and the service was excellent.,2
Beautiful setting with delicious fresh Greek cuisine,3
Great service as very attentive.  Food was good.  Have only 2 choices for coffee.  Greek and American.  Would go again,3
We had a wonderful date night at the Greek on main.  Appetizers : grilled calamari (absolutely delicious)  and spanakopita ( also very good).   We both had whole fish.  I had the sea bass and my husband had the red snapper.  Both were excellent.  I would certainly recommend this place for dinner.   Just keep in mind it's byob!,3
Still on my top list. I'm always happy to come back to this place,5
Returned on a Monday.  Apparently served leftovers from the weekend.  Won't be back.,4
We happened to dine during restaurant week in Metuchen!  Great value and delicious meal along with excellent service!!,4
"We had dinner there for the first time for our anniversary. We arrived early and they very graciously took us right away. It was not busy at 6PM on a Saturday, but by 6:30 it was and by 7PM it was pretty packed.  ",4
"The food was excellent, we had a hard time deciding and started with two appetizers. It was hard to choose what to order. Our main courses were divine, I had lamb chops and bulgur with red pepper and spinach, my husband had steak. If I were to go back, I would try the whole fish options. ",5
"We were too stuffed for dessert, but we were comped a dessert to share by the restaurant. The few bites we had were incredible. ",5
This was a great little find in Metuchen. It was not hard to find parking even though it is on a main street. There was outdoor seating and big windows inside which were perfect for people watching as people strolled by. It had a lovely neighborhood feel. Service was warm and inviting.,5
Best seafood and apps I've had since visiting Greece!,5
"2nd time eating here.  Our waitress seemed overwhelmed when asked questions AND a bit confused.  The food was very good, ample portions",5
The appetizers are wonderful and worth sharing   ,4
"Try it, you'll like it for sure!",5
Interesting menu - enjoyed the meal  Had two 8-year-olds with us and they were very accommodating.  All found something enjoyable to eat.,4
The shrimp were a bit overcooked  ... there was only one appetizer combo platter -- other greek restaurants we love offer at least 1 cold and 1 hot combo of appys so you have the opportunity to share with others in your party and taste a wider variety of dishes.,5
"the service was very nice and although it was very noisy, the ambiance was also lovely ... its hard to find a nice restaurant for saturday nite dining that is not noisy unfortunately",4
"Love this place!  Food is wonderful, consistently great, very authentic.  Owners are fabulous, friendly, concerned about their diners, go the extra mile.  Atmosphere is warm and welcoming.  Have had special occasions here (father in laws 75th bday party), as well as quiet dinners with my husband, couples dinners and girls nights.  Would strongly recommend, does not disappoint!",5
Amazing Greek food !! As if you are actually in Greece having dinner.,4
"Great Greek Restaurant, best grilled Octopus I've had, love the variations of seafood. Went with a party of nine and everyone was very happy with their meals. BYOB is an added bonus. I've been here before , and will definitely be back again.",5
"this was our first time at the restaurant,  we like Greek food and always looking for new place to go, food was delicious",5
We ate here for the first time.  Waiter was pleasant but was hard to understand .. He didn't get the order correct. Food was delicious though,5
"Fantastic food, service and BYOB.  The chef is humble and on point.  The Veggie options he added and then further customized for reasonable price was amazing (red sauce).  Also the lobster was great and nice portions.  The moosaka (cant spell it) was loved by family.  The best part was our service.  She was an amazingly talented young waitress who was patient kind and got everything we asked for. Thank you for a great birthday dinner!  Amazing grape leaves too!",5
"My colleagues from California and Florida were in and wanted them to try some Greek Food.  Boy were they impressed.   From the octopus to the lamb chops, the flavor kept coming. ""I wished we had this in L. A."" he said.   Great times and great food.",3
Excellent choice for an evening out. Great addition to the Metuchen dining scene.,5
"When we made the Open Table reservations, we I indicated that it was my wife's birthday. This was not acknowledge even when ate there the next day and said it was my wife's birthday on the reservation",3
"We absolutely love The Bear Mountain Inn. We grew up visiting the state park and love the beauteousness of the area. My husband and I had our Wedding reception there 17 years ago and the food was superb. The Sunday Brunch is still wonderful. Unfortunately, our dinner at Restaurant 1915 left much to be desired. The hot dog was great. The short rib was good. My Caesar salad was undressed and not enjoyable. Please bring the food back up to par. We love this beautiful Inn and want to continue dining there in the future.",5
"Love this place!  Very underrated, and with a great view!",3
"Bear mountain inn dropped the ball on this visit. I had a spa appt booked so my husband and I decided to have brunch at the Inn. Mistake! From the food to the service it was a terrible experience. Food was dry and non existent in the buffet servers, not replenished or refreshed. The salmon  and asparagus dish was dry with only tiny broken pieces of salmon. Penne Alfredo was dry and hard. I had to ask for lemon for the shrimp cocktail,  the dish was empty, I can go on and on. Service was NON EXISTENT!!",3
"We were seated by hostess , waited 15 minutes with no waitress service yet. The hostess FINALLY came over and said to head over to buffet and start, she will tell our waitress when she sees her to get us coffee. After 20 minutes of eating, finished my coffee and mimosa,  no visit from waitress to see how we were doing. Flagged down a woman bussing tables, she refilled my coffee. Our waitress was talking to the table next to us for a long time and never turned around !! I had to GET up, walk over to her and ask her for my check!  I left a good tip too, Ridiculous!!!! Never ever going back, West Point is 5 minutes away from there, will be having brunch thete from now on!",3
Very delicious food. Servers were nice and attentive. Not much of a selection of food but what we had was very good. A drink menu would of been nice. Good selection of beer and wine though.,5
"I didn't realize that it was a limited dinner menu on this night.  I don't remember seeing that printed anywhere when i viewed the menu on the website.  For our special occasion,  i wanted more than a lunch menu.  Food was still very tasty.",5
We had a great time in this beautiful restaurant located in the Bear Mt. Inn. Food was good. Staff was friendly.,3
"I'm afraid we had a terrible dining experience at Restaurant 1915.   It was January 1st, and I guess they had no food or staff left after their New Year's event the night before.  The tables were dark, the decorative lights weren't plugged in, and only one or two had candles (ours didn't).   We had bread plates, but after asking for bread, we were told, ""We don't have any tonight"".   The food took forever to come, and when it did, it was ice-cold.  We sent it back, and were brought new plates, but they weren't much warmer.  It was a quail dish that was chewy and tasteless.  Also very little food for $27.   We ordered dessert because we were still hungry!  Our waitress was very nice, but we waited forever for the meal and then for the check.   We also noticed that other tables received large burgers and fries which looked delicious.  When we asked about them, (they weren't on the menu) we were told that others had complained, so they were given burgers!  We wish we'd known this was an option.",5
Great dining room and real fireplace made for a very cozy feeling. Service a little slow as it was NYE and staff was limited. Food was good and served timely but was not hot. But very creative and delicious anyway.,5
OMG.  DON'T GO.  ALL THE OTHER REVIEWS ARE SPOT ON.  THEY SCREW UP SOMEONE'S MEAL AT EVERY TABLE. SERVICE IS HORRIBLE. PAID $40 FOR A STEAK COOKED ON A GRIDDLE RATHER THAN A GRILL.  FINISHED EATING THE FATTY STEAK BEFORE MY SIDE DISHES EVER CAME OUT.  MY DAUGHTER ORDERED GRILLED CHEESE AND FRIES AND GOT MAC AND CHEESE AND FRIES.  SCARY THING IS THEY DON'T REALIZE HOW BAD THEY ARE. AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE.,5
We ordered fish and it was delivered with head and bones.  And we were told they didn’t debone fish.  Coffee for dessert was burned.  Service was awful and waiter not knowledgeable or friendly.,5
"My wife and I came here for our 40th Wedding Anniversary. The staff was friendly, but due to a large group, the service was extremely slow.",2
"My wife’s venison was cooked to perfection.  However, the server hurriedly dropped the wrong entree (someone else’s steak!) on my place without  noticing the error and before bringing me my appetizer soup. She scurried away with another meal to another table.",4
Another server then brought out my soup and entree at the same time.  ,1
"The butternut  soup was great, but my short ribs were rare and unappetizing. My original server took it back to the kitchen where they prepared a replacement dish of fully cooked short ribs.  All in all, it took three attempts to serve me the correct entree! ",4
"Except for the sentimental attachment we have to the Bear Mtn. Inn, the food service was very poor and it took three attempts for me to obtain my correct entree of short ribs",4
"Came to Social Kitchen for Mother's Day brunch and it was delicious. Loved the wide variety of offerings (Indian samosas and tandoori spring rolls, vegetable ravioli in vodka sauce, omelet station with lots of fresh ingredient choices, carving station, desserts, fruits and cheese/antipasto and more), not to mention the yummy mimosas. The hotel has been renovated and the place looks so great, too. I will definitively come here again.",4
The service was very slow and the food quality was less than expected after such a long wait. Will likely not return.,4
It was cold and unless you where seated in front of the fireplace it felt like a cafeteria.  The food was good but I was distracted by the cold.  Service was nice but a bit untrained for the price of the dinner.  I was hoping for a cozy romantic environment and got the sense it was at one time but no longer.  Good was worth the price if the environment had been more comfortable.,4
"Have been here before and it used to be fancier. Anyway, service was amateurish there were 5 of us and the setting was for 4. The server asked ""do you need a plate?"" To start, my reservation was for 6 pm and I requested a table next to the fireplace, well we didn't get it, strike one.  My kids ordered hamburgers which were good but the french fries were cold , soggy and under cooked, strike 2. My meal did not come with the others I was told there was a computer glitch and it should be out in 5 minutes....15 minutes later it arrived and it was cold....After I called the manager over and explained my meal was sent back and deducted from the tab. ",4
Overall disappointed,3
"It really is and can be a great place, I hope they improve.",5
Terrible experience complained over and over the manager did nothing for us,4
We bring a group of at least 10 people in every year usually around the Christmas break. In previous years we were disappointed in the service and quality of the food. They seemed under staffed and not prepared for larger groups. Which is ironic because they host weddings. ,4
"This time however, we loved the service. Our waitress was outstanding. She came back to check on us, and was very apologetic when the kitchen made a mistake on one of the orders.",4
"The prices are still steep for what you get, but where else in the area can you get the log cabin Inn feel, a roaring fire, and so close to Bear Mt activities.  ",4
We’ll return and hope that they continue their positive trajectory with quality and service!,4
"Let me start off with the fact that we had to pay for parking, $10.00 and we arrived at 4:50. Then at 5:00 the parking attendant left. Did he really have to charge me for going out to dinner at their restaurant? Then, we arrived early a 1/2 hour before our reservation. There were plenty of available open, clean tables but hostess could not seat us because she said there were not enough servers. We asked for a table by the window and she said she will make a note, really? With all the open tables? Then we sat...stunned by the LIMITED menu. We thought it would be more of a fancier dinner....not! Very pub/cafeteria style food on menu. Service was slow...at 5:30 pm.... dinner time? Not enough servers? Food was okay, kind of skimpy. My son had to get two quesadillas...appetizer sized servings. Bear Mountain Inn at Christmas time. Beautiful fireplace... not lit. No holiday ambience.  Very disappointed...will not be returning nor recommending.",1
We went for Christmas meal but they only had sandwiches and salads and no vegetarian soup option.. ended up just having a glass of wine and a Caesar salad.. they said they did not serve dinner til 5 but no one told us that when we made reservation and we went there anticipating a wonderful Christmas meal.. so disappointing.,1
Sadly we visited on Christmas Eve and was extremely disappointed. Price fixed menu with nothing for kids was unacceptable. After 20 mins we had to ask for bread. Service was very slow. One meal came after four of us were practically done. ,2
Three years ago we had a very nice experience. So we will not be back anytime soon.,1
"The food and atmosphere was excellent! We really enjoyed the rustic yet elegant feel! The fireplace was large, warm, and inviting. We had a large family  group on Christmas Eve and  the staff was very friendly and accommodating! Definitely one of our favorite restaurants in the area!",3
"Beautiful place, just needs better management and better food.  Dining room is fantastic and rustic with a giant fireplace.  Great for winter get together.  We originally made our reservation for 3:30 for eight people online, but decided to call to confirm.  Thankfully we did, because I was then told the restaurant did not even open until 5 pm.  The Inn and the surrounding property is breathtaking and just beautiful.  But one of the hostesses was very curt and should find a new line of work.  High chair was broken, and since no one came to take our drink order or introduce themselves to us after being seated for over 15 minutes, we went and found our own.  Our waitress was very friendly and accommodating when she showed up.  For the amount they are charging per plate, you would expect amazing food.  Second time here for dinner, and was disappointed both times.  Meat was burned on outside and raw on inside.  Loaded with fat.    Bread pudding was cold.  Upon waking the next day, I received an email that was rather rude stating that I had not shown for my reservation of eight and next time we should cancel, etc.  I was afraid they charged my credit card for cancellation fee, so I had to call to make sure they didn't.  Just totally unorganized.  I really hope someone takes over this place and makes it worth while.  It has so much potential.",5
"Like many of the reviews, my family had a similar experience to what many people had posted. The food was ok, the ambiance is exceptional and the service is, in a word, terrible. I'm not sure why. We went to an early dinner and there were no more that 2 other occupied tables. Yet we had to, more than once, search out our waiter. The only time he showed up, was after our dinner, he came over with check in hand before even asking if we were intersted in coffee/desert. Hopefully ownership will heed these numerous poor reviews and address their waiter/waitress staff.",3
Just loved everything about it . The fireplace is so perfect and the food was delicious. Will be back again . Steven our waiter was wonderful,1
Nice experience good food,4
Best Mountain is a scenic drive,1
Food is fabulous! Beautiful dining room and friendly atmosphere. Go! You will love the gorgeous mountains and hiking.,1
Did a wonderful job for a nice Mother's Day Brunch.  The chef walked around to ensure we were all happy and even made my daughter special potatoes.   The restaurant was VERY accommodating.  Definitely go back again.,5
"Quite, clean, comfortable, good food and friendly service",1
"I enjoyed the food. The hostess was very friendly.  Our waitress I thought was not available that much had to look for her to get extra coffee, or even to get our drink order took forever for her to come over and also the check.  Was hoping to see more of a festive decor.",4
"While the dishes are surprisingly well presented,  the appetizers and the main dishes leave much to be desired.",1
"One of the worst experiences!  We took out of town guests and no one was impressed. It cost $39pp and the service was absolutely horrible and it wasn’t even busy. . The food was okay, not great, and for the price you can only have one mimosa or one Bloody Mary. We arrived, was promptly seated, and we waited and waited for a server. After 20 minutes, had to ask the hostess for a server for coffee. Our plates were not removed during trips to the buffet, so by the end of the meal, we had 10+ plates on the table. Had to ask again for more coffee. And to top it off, the wait person received an automatic 18.5% gratuity. Getting paid $35 in tips for doing nothing. I spoke to two supervisors and they said sorry.  Would not recommend.",1
Great service from start to finish! Amazing food and beautiful ambience!,3
"Way too bright - need to turn down lights for more ambiance- especially in bar.  Felt like I was in the Knights of Columbus!  Staff couldn't find key to wine closet when we ordered a bottle of wine.  Server disappeared for awhile when asked for additional sauce (food was dry).    Food was just ok.  Decor is lovely, just need to match the service and the food.  It is an average restaurant, not worth the drive.",5
"This restaurant is the reason I want to return to the Bear Mountain Inn to stay for a few nights. Great food, service and courteous staff.",1
Love this place. Great selection for lunch. Service was good. Beautiful view.,3
We went here during a day trip to Bear Mountain. Thankfully I had made reservations in advance cause it was pretty crowded. We were seated almost immediately. Service was prompt. My husband had the burger and I had the roast beef sandwich. Food took a little time to arrive but it was pretty good and value for money. The place had a very warm and cozy ambience to it.,3
"Had brunch here during a break from our daylong cruise up the Hudson to Bear Mountain. It's the only dining option besides a more casual cafe at the Inn, for those without a car. The brunch buffet was diverse and plentiful and the staff very friendly. $39 seems steep for brunch though.",4
Completely mediocre in every way except the setting.,2
"Disappointing meal, small selection is fine if anything on the menu was done well. The club sandwich came with nearly raw, cold bacon, when I asked the server “is this cooked” she looked at it for a bit and said “yeah that’s cooked”. Didn’t offer to cook it more or replace it, so the bacon was pushed aside because no one gnaws on it straight from the fridge like that. Fries were over cooked and brown and hard however so if we could have just averaged that out...Cesar salad was too salty and overdressed, clearly dumped on wet greens as the bottom of the plate was covered in watered down dressing. Both very basic dishes. Creme brûlée under the sugar was ice cold on one side and warm on the other. No idea how they managed that, we were sharing a dessert 30 degrees apart. Definitely not worth a return trip.",2
"Great food in a panoramic setting!! I had the fish and chips — the beer batter was so light and not a drop greasy and the fish was superb!! The maitre d’ service was a bit strange - we were seated at a table that had no service items in place (utensils, bread plates, etc) while all the other tables had these items - and had to wait after our food was served to get them.  The restaurant was not crowded and yet another table was seated directly next to us.  Our table service was fine - requests were promptly filled.  We will certainly go back!",3
This restaurant was listed as participating in Hudson Valley Restaurant Week but we were not offered a promotional menu. We ended up paying a lot more than expected ~ would not go back.,3
"Excellent service, excellent food!!!lovely atmosphere!!!",5
"Excellent food,excellent service, very welcoming atmosphere for our little baby!!!!really enjoyed our dinner!!!",5
"Wonderful ambiance, outstanding food..... a few issues need to be tweaked, such as getting rid of the diner pepper shaker when one requests pepper... at the prices for the meal invest in pepper grinders!  Also if food has to be packaged to take home , don’t use the cheapest take out containers... my container was crushed and rendered the contents inedible... I may as well have just tossed the $38 for the entree",5
"Service was a tad rushed. We were there for an early dinner so may have wanted to turn table.  I was a waiter/bartender in my youth, so I understand.   Seated near in and out of kitchen not the best, though not terrible. The food was excellent, if a bit pricey.  We will be back.  Quality of the food the reason.",5
"Great food,freindly staff! Love the homemade cheesecake!",5
We had a wonderful meal! The food was fantastic and the service was great. The table next to us was too loud but that can happen anywhere! We highly recommend this restaurant! Finished the meal with Victor’s amazing cheesecake! Perfect!,5
This was my first time at the Metuchen Inn.  I was celebrating my birthday with my family and couldn't have picked a better place.  The food was delicious and the service was great.  I would definitely choose this restaurant again for another special occasion.,5
"We always enjoy our meals !  Love sitting near the fireplace, cozy atmosphere.",5
"Our first visit here was an early Sunday dinner and there was already a nice crowd dining.  Service was crisp and attentive.  The menu choices were appealing and there were also attractive daily specials.  We started with colossal sized shrimp in their shrimp cocktail and the lobster and potato soup of the day.  Both were very good choices.  Our main course selections were Diver Scallops and Osso Bucco, which were prepared and presented beautifully.  Total pleasure and expect to return.  Not a bargain, but not a surprise either.",5
Always a wonderful dining experience. The food is excellent and Jose and Jose can’t do enough for their patrons. I am ready to go back as soon as I leave.,5
Had  a lovely lunch on Sunday afternoon with friends we hadn't seen in a long time. We were able to linger and have a relaxed meal . There was a birthday party seated near us and yet we were able to enjoy quiet conversation. ,4
Highly recommend.,4
"Very enjoyable experience overall. The service was excellent, the food delicious (something for everyone), and prices very fair for the value. We’ll be back!",4
Not Impressed:(. Been there before and it used to be better but this time it was a huge disappointment .  $27 for a chicken with some potatoes that wasn’t even that warm?!  Pretty locale but food is way overpriced and waiters a bit snooty:(,3
Meal/service was excellent. Only downside is the parking. It was a very cold night and we had to park on the street about a block away from the restaurant.,3
"My wife and I had an excellent meal and our server John was very attentive. For an appetizer, I had the Lobster/Potato bisque which was one of the best that I have ever eaten. I was a bit disappointed that there was no lobster meat in the bisque but overall i would have it again it was that good. The lamp chops were also excellent.",3
This was our first visit.  Food was good but felt it was overpriced.  Good drinks & service was good.,5
Food and staff were outstanding! A must visit if you enjoy fine dining.,5
We had lunch at this restaurant. The service was a little slow. The food was good but the portions were small. It ambulance was very nice.,5
"Outstanding. — everything was fabulous! Service, food and ambiance. Had a great time.",4
Great food great service easy parking for metuchen,5
This is our favorite spot! The food is always delicious and the service is exceptional. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming. Everyone on staff makes you feel like the most important customer. We were celebrating DH’s 70th birthday. We started with shrimp cocktail...very large crustaceans... 4 plenty to split. We both chose asoecisl of pan seared sea bass served over corn and asparagus in a lemon saffron sauce...delicious. We had strudel for dessert... and were treated to a serenade by all. Perfect evening for a special occasion.,5
"Friendly, professional staff, menu selection well prepared, food quality very good, upscale wine list",5
As always spectacular meal & service was outstanding! Thank you thank you for your consistent service & quality food!,5
"We were there on Christmas so I understand things may have been alittle stressful for staff.  After a bumpy start, things worked out well.  Food was very good and we appreciate the fact some are working on Christmas Day.",5
The most amazing salad with apple slices i have ever had in addition to the halibut that i ordered.,5
Extraordinary experience! Food was amazing!! Ambience is great!,5
"After so many experiences, I still happily anticipate another. The warm greeting often by one of the owners sets the mood right in the door. I'm always impressed that the staff remembers my favorite preferences. Quiet attention is always present.",5
"We are locals so this was not our first time at Metuchen Inn and I was lucky enough to snag a reservation for Christmas Eve.  Lucky indeed because it seemed every table was occupied within minutes of our arrival.  We were warmly greeted and seated immediately upon arrival.  We were seated upstairs-first time I dined upstairs which turned out to be quieter than downstairs and quite festive and nice.  My dining companion ordered the filet mignon-although I am not a meat eater it looked as great as a good filet should and my companion was pleased and his plate was pretty clear of any filet at the end of the course.  My halibut was good and  a good size but otherwise unimpressive; vegetables for both meals prepared to perfection.  But the true star of the show for the evening was our waiter who was excellent.  Engaging yet unobtrusive, he just seemed quite pleased to be there and serving us.  The dessert menu was surprisingly sparse and uninspiring for a holiday perhaps the kitchen assumed most people would be partaking of goodies at home, which is what we did.  All in all a very nice evening.",5
Another amazing meal at the Metuchen Inn.  I eat here regularly and they have never failed to serve an outstanding dining experience.,5
Metuchen Inn never disappoints! Food was great from appetizers to dessert. Love the atmosphere and the friendly owners. Always run into people we know and haven't seen in awhile...,5
Haven't been there in a few years. Will be back much sooner. Great experience.,5
Wonderful service which is thoughtful and accommodating. Entrees and appetizers are perfectly seasoned and presented beautifully. The ability to buy half bottles of wine is also a nice feature. Always a seamless dining experience.,5
We live right here in Metuchen and never really tried Metuchen Inn.   Everything exceeded our expectations.  Great wile list and Constantine was extremely nice and kept checking in to make sure everything was great!  We WILL be back!,4
"Metuchen Inn is always good.   Food was delicious.  Everyone was happy with their meals.  I had the short ribs which were exceptional.  Only complaint was service at bar.  Bartender was very busy and hustling to make drinks for the servers to bring to the tables. Unfortunately, that left me without a drink at the bar.  After sitting without service for quite a while,  it took a complaint to management to get a drink.  Not the best start to an otherwise lovely evening.",4
"I have dined at them attention in many times and it never fails to be an excellent, excellent experience! Yesterday I took my staff out for a holiday lunch and I had the braised beef which melted in my mouth ! Delicious!!! Everyone enjoyed their meal and we always have a great time. The owner always makes us feel like we are his family and he’s known this for years!",5
Always a go to place for fine dining and business functions.,4
"Went here for my Dad's 81st Birthday.  We had a few appetizers to share.  The arugula salad was quite small and the amount of goat cheese and walnuts on it was minimal...could have been a little more of both.  Rack of lamb was delicious....potatoes good; minimal portion of asparagus.  Calamari appetizer excellent.  Seafood dinner excellent as well.  Osso Bucco good but not the best we ever had.  Cocktails, wine and after dinner specialty coffees  steep at $14/each.  Ambiance very good; menu could use updating to advise what can be made ""gluten free""....staff and owner very nice and social.  Would go back!!",5
"all around an excellent restaurant -  excellent food, service and ambience - and quiet - it was good to be able to talk and be heard",5
"As always,  they provide a pleasant welcome, a relaxed atmosphere and a quiet place to talk and, of course, excellent food.",5
"We have been coming to this restaurant for years and it is consistently excellent!   The ambiance, food and service is superb, would highly recommend this restaurant!",5
I am not sure I would come back. We were a party of 3 all of us thought the main course was mediocre. I had the halibut which was so overcooked and mousy I thought it was mashed potatoes. However appetizers and dessert were great. Ambiance and decor great. Service great. However the food is important. Maybe I would try the bar menu another time.,4
Amazinggggg food. The paella was delicious!!,5
Absolutely amazing. Will definitely go back again,5
The food and drinks where incredible.,5
"Great place for appetizer, drinks and dancing. If you plan to have dinner prepare to wait. Staff was attentive and professional.",5
I have been looking for a good Cuban restaurant in the area.  I was not disappointed.  The food was very tasty and the prices were fair.  It was not very noisy which was a concern of mine before having gone there.  I will be back.,5
Olive Garden for Cuban food.  The meat was overdone. The seafood was overdone in the paella. The guacamole was dark green meaning not fresh.,4
PROS: ,5
Appetizer was very good and the wine was decent. ,5
Music got better as the night went on,5
Great drinks from the bar and very good prices. ,5
CONS: ,5
Waiter was rude and seemed annoyed the whole time even responding sarcastically to simple questions about the menu items. Really annoyed by this considering the gratuity was included with the bill. An amount he most definitely did not deserve. ,5
Meal was over seasoned and  served completely cold. ,5
Would go back only for drinks and appetizers at the bar.,4
"Overall great. However,  the bill was outrageous for two people.  But, will try again.",3
Best service food and experience !! The appetizers were delicious and the sangria was sooooo good.,5
Great spot. Live DJ or music with dancing on the weekends. Food is okay. Definitely becoming a hot spot as I notice the crowd has been changing and growing over the past couple times I’ve been there. Just hoping it doesn’t become a rowdy spot.,2
"Enjoyed the restaurant very much.  Our server was waiting for a few later arrivals for our table, but did not come over to ask if we wanted anything while we waited.  Otherwise, enjoyed the food and drinks.  Also, waiter brought out a large ""firework"" candle to celebrate my friend's birthday!",2
I was just there for my friends birthday and everything came out amazing! The food and the sangria were amazing! Our waiter Chris was extremely helpful and really went above and beyond. Would definitely recommend!,4
"Excellent place, good food, I love the music 🎶 on Saturdays, mojitos were good",4
We took our mom to Cuba Mia for her 70th birthday.  It was a very quiet Sunday night.  The appetizers were fantastic (highly recommend the shrimp ceviche).  However the service was slow although more than half of the restaurant was empty.,4
Everything was awesome that’s my everything and best place ever!!!!!!!,3
Food was not good. Ordered ropa vieja and it tasted as though the sauce was out of the Prego can. Strawberry mojito was not tasty at all and had a weird aftertaste. Ordered Cuban fruit platter for dessert- sent it back as the taste was terrible. Service was awful- waitress barely checked in with us and we had to ask another waiter to find her to give us the check.,1
"There was not enough wait staff as the restaurant got more crowded.  Waiter never came back to table after taking the order.  Also, while the live music was very good, it was too loud for the tables set up right near the band.",4
"Best Cuban food I ever had, great place to hang out after work. Looking forward to come back again.",1
"Best experience ever, dance and drinks and the DJ is great he got game!!!! I go every Saturday night and every Saturday it’s getting more interesting...Great ppl..keep the good work!!!!",1
"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our first visit. The food was delicious, portions great, and prices very reasonable. Not a night that entertainment was available, but we'll definitely go to enjoy it soon. We were very pleasantly surprised at this OpenTable find.",3
"A bit on the pricey side, but food is outstanding!!",4
"We are 1 for three with service at this restaurant.  The food and the manager, Vee, are what keep us coming back.  The service is poor and slow.  It is only when I speak with the manager that orders seem to be placed and placed correctly.  The food is very good for the price.",1
"This was the second time I had been to Cuba Mia. The food was absolutely delicious and our server, Yarelis, was attentive and friendly. We celebrated birthdays for a few family members and were given the private room because we were such a large party. Everything was ready for us when we arrived. This place is a hidden gem. I would definitely go back to check out the live music and DJ on a Friday or Saturday night.",3
Food was great! Service slow.,4
Food was great and the ambiance was perfect.  Our server Chris was a delight.  Can't wait to go back 🍷,4
Couldn’t possibly be worse. No mention of live music. Moved 3 times. Still couldn’t hear. Food awful. Left after appetizers. Drinks were awful.,4
It was great. Would definitely recommend and return.,3
"My experience at Cuba Mia started by waiting at the bar for 15 minutes, trying to get the bartender's attention. Luckily, a couple seated next to us told the bartender we had been waiting 15 minutes for a drink and she eventually took our order... only to take another 15 minutes to actually make and deliver our drinks, leaving one out.",5
"In total, we had 11 people. My family and I ordered appetizers to begin with several drinks. None of the speciality drinks were what anyone would consider 'great.' The red sangria was just 'okay,' the mojitos were extremely sweet and the Cuba Mia speciality drink was too spicy to drink. We received drinks we did not order and had to send back the mojitos for the sweetness. ",5
"Our appetizers came out in a timely fashion, though the waiter did bring out the incorrect vegetarian empanadas. The beef and guava/cheese empanadas were absolutely amazing. The tostones had no seasoning, neither did the yuca fries and the chicken in the empanadas was dry.",5
"As for dinner, it was a complete disaster. Our food came out over 30 minutes after we ordered and just about every single item was cold, except the paella. The pulled beef was completely burnt, lacking any seasoning at all. The steaks, chicken, EVERYTHING was completely cold. The fajitas that were ordered came with tortillas that were so crisp, a fajita could not be rolled from it. Some of us sent back our entrees, others were too hungry to wait for them to reheat the dishes. The chicken dish that was returned then HAD A HAIR IN IT. ",5
"This was the absolute WORST meal we have all experienced. The manager felt so bad that she gave us 75% off our bill. DO NOT EAT HERE, DO NOT DRINK HERE. This place is poorly managed and we will be sure to tell anyone that asks that this is the WORST restaurant in possibly the entire state.",4
This was my first time at Cuba Mia and the food and drinks were amazing. I will definitely go back.,4
Food and service were excellent.  We will be back!,4
Good food.  Way too noisy.  Band has to start later.,4
"Pricing was high for the portion size. Service was nice, but they kept trying to clear our plates while some people were still eating, which is just wrong.",4
"Great spot for legit Cuban food.  Chris, our server, made a wonderful experience that much better....",5
"Authentic Cuban Food.  Delicious, great atmosphere, great music.  Highly recommend it!   We'll be back soon!!!",3
I have to rate my overall experience as fair because I broke out into hives the night I went there. I ordered the cerviche app. with shrimp and I had a mojito. Both of which I have always ordered at other restaurants. Idk if it was a bad batch of shrimp or I developed a new allergy but I ALWAYS eat shrimp. I will determine whether or not I will be returning once I see an allergist.,4
"Amazing food and drinks, great Latin music and ambiance, chef Serafín always ready to deliver above and beyond ! A place worth to visit over and over",5
"Great ambiance, food, and mojitos! My only concern was the band was extremely loud; being there for my birthday it was difficult to speak to/ catch up with my seven friends as we had to yell to hear each other. Will definitely go back!",5
"I made a reservation for a party of 10. The waitress barely acknowledged us. The manager was passing by and we asked him if he could get our waitress. He looked annoyed that we asked him to get our waitress- he supposedly took our order even though he didn't write anything down. It took 1.5 hr to get the food and when we got the food, the orders were wrong and the food wasn't even hot. We definitely will never go there again.",5
Went out for in search of good Spanish food and discovered a little slice of Havana. From the live music to the overall decor Cuba Mia had us feeling transported to South Beach Miami at the very least. Would definitely recommend to all my friends and most certainly will be back to visit again!! Sangria or Mojitos you can't go wrong!!,5
"It was amazing! The food was delicious and everyone from the hostess, buser, waitress, etc. took care of us throughout the meal. We will definitely be back!",5
"Early New Year's Eve dinner-date (spouses).  One of our favorite go-to places, for the food, the ocean view and especially the friendly personable  service, never disappoints. I could eat the sambuca oysters over and over.  The fresh seafood is always a great choice -- grouper in this case, was excellent.",5
"We had an exceptional experience for our first visit.  Maria, the Manager went out of her way to make sure we had a good time celebrating my husband's birthday.",5
"Food was awesome.  Best pork chop I have ever had.   Service was equally good.  BYOB, but if you forget you can order table delivery from local store.    Oceanfront, try to dine when there's still daylight for best view.",5
Great Food and Great Staff !!!  We Love Bareli’s in Summer AND winter ....,5
We spent a wonderful evening dining at Bareli’s. We were greeted with a friendly welcoming hello when we arrived.  The waiter was engaging without being intrusive. The tables are set nicely. The food was creative and delicious and nicely served. We didn’t feel rushed and had a relaxing evening with friends.,4
Great food and service. It's a  BYOB so that's always good.,5
It was our first time and we loved the entire experience!  A great find!,5
We very much enjoyed the wonderful service and excellent food in the cozy setting of the front porch room. The lasagna was very interesting-not typically prepared. Also the calamari was one of the best we ever had. Creme brûlée was fabulous-we’ll be back soon!,5
"Talk about an A+ restaurant, this is it!  Located on Ocean Ave in the old Spring Lake Hotel, the Grand Victorian, the atmosphere here is fabulous.  ",5
"The hotel is beautifully decorated for the holidays & although it was dark so the ocean wasn't visible, you can still feel the salt in the air.  That being said, I think December is the perfect time to come here.  The crowds are gone, holiday lights abound & it's quite peaceful.  ",5
Four of us ate on the enclosed porch outside with a great view through the glass enclosure. We were able to carry on a conversation & actually hear each other.,5
"Our waiter, Mike was top notch.  We wanted for nothing, including him offering me his glasses as I had forgotten mine!",5
"The meal began with a basket of fresh, warm bread.  For an appetizer I decided on the baked oysters Sambuca that were just magnificent.  Next the Penne ala grappa which was a vodka sauce with spinach. For dessert I had a Nutella mousse that was decadent & delicious.  I was in food heaven!",4
"This time of year the restaurant is BYOB which is a big plus.  Let's face it, Spring Lake is a money town & when they sell liquor, you will pay a steep price for it.  Same for the food.  Lucky for us they had a price fix menu all day Wed & Thurs (again, this time of year) & for $33 three out of four had a 3 course meal.  I might add my husband got the pork chop & described it as a Flintstone pork chop.  It was about 3"" thick & as big as my hand.  I have seriously never seen one that large & he LOVED it!  Of course I tasted it as well & it was cooked to perfection.",5
"Mike was a pleasure & we all had a wonderful time.  I will definitely be back, but for sure, NOT during the summer months!",4
"Great service, love the setting of seeing ocean as you dine",5
"The restaurant was delightful, the staff were very accommodating and attentive. Food was worth the price, great presentation and cooked too perfection. Will go back again for sure.",5
"Wonderful intimate family dinner for Thanksgiving. One course better than the next. Quiet, warm, cozy atmosphere for great food and conversation. Waiting staff spot on and truly lovely.",5
My family went there for Thanksgiving for the first time. The staff was attentive and very courteous. The food was delicious! We will definitely go back!,5
"Friendly staff, not rushed dining, excellent food- byob off season.",5
We had a terrific anniversary dinner.,5
"Now that it’s off season, we figured it’s a good time to try Bareli’s.  The service was great, the restaurant is attractive, but the food was a bit disappointing.  It’s fine, just doesn’t blow you away.  Most restaurants are average, this one included.  There are a lot of better places & a lot of worse ones too.",5
"Food great - nice selection,  nice place - noisy though,  service very slow - had to wait quite a while for a drink & for an appetizer - need to improve on that issue",5
The front room is the draw here. The noise level in the rest of the restaurant not good. We were seated right in front of the musicians and when asked immediately to be moved out in direct line w kitchen. Our server was very attentive but the other 3 wait staff were overkill. Could not complete a sentence without an interuption by staff. Well-meaning but annoying.,4
"The website says wheelchair accessible and it IS NOT. The food and service was excellent, but I did not enjoy myself as I had to get out of the wheelchair and get up one step and the bathroom did not have a grab bar and the wheelchair barely fit. Please do not advertise wheelchair accessible.",4
Very impressed with the quality of the food -we all had different entrees and everyone loved their choices. Will definitely go back. Wish they had heat lamps for outside dining.,4
Everything was great but they need to lower the music especially if you sit in glass porch,4
Made reservation for my wife's birthday last weekend. Came as a referral from a close friend. I called to alert them it was my wife birthday. Left a message and they promptly called me back asking for table preference / location - inside or outside. We decided on inside. Only minor complaint was it was chilly inside. Felt like air was on when it didn't need to be. Saw others with sweaters and long sleeves on so maybe it's also a bit on cold side. ,5
Orher than that everything was great - calamari app was delicious as was eggplant and entrees were all solid as well. Nice candle for wife in her desert to top it all off. Would def recommend if anyone was on area. Will plan a return during the summer to sit outside and enjoy the views,5
Didn't like the steak or the snapper dinners. Service was spotty.,5
Location was amazing right across the street from the beach. Great outdoor seating and extensive menu. Let’s come back and try the summer. Service was really good. Will definitely recommend to be back. Thank you,5
Nothing like we expected - fish was dry with no flavor- very disappointed,4
"Barelli's is still the best kept secret at the Jersey shore. It is so hard to find excellent Italian food down the shore but Bareli's  hits the mark! And, it is open year round . Now that the summer is over, it is the perfect time to enjoy it. Not crowded but still great!",3
New owner investment can be seen and felt.  Local elegance with menu nicely developed.  And liquor license is great addition to this location.  Service is excellent - staff truly cares.  We selected the Sunday Italian dinner which was very good.  Highly recommend if you like classy dining experience.,5
Made a last minute 6:30 reservation on a Saturday night  and while a table was ready - it was not a preferred one being small and next to a large table of 8.  Maria (the hostess) asked if we would wait in the bar area (they only have a seasonal license which expires November 2017).  We had one drink and while a table was not ready within 15 minutes - Maria came over to assure us she was working on it and promptly bought us two additional drinks while waiting.  Five minutes later a very nice table was secured.  Waiter Jack very accommodating and helpful.  Be sure to try the oyster appetizer - to die for !  Food well prepared and professionally served.,3
All in all a very nice experience.  The staff is very cordial and Maria seems to know all the patrons (hopefully ours now too).  Nice touch!!,5
"While we have never dined at Barelli's in Secaucus, we will be frequent patrons of Barelli's by the Sea",5
Typically I wait until I’ve dined someplace at least three times and occasionally more before I’ll sit down and take the time to write a review but after only two meals at Barelli’s I feel compelled to put this out there.,5
"First off it is a lovely location, located in a hotel in picturesque Spring Lake and on the other side of the street it sits on is the ocean, just beautiful! ",5
"Secondly on both occasions, once for dinner and more recently for lunch I had mixed food experiences, a linguini with clam sauce that had a fishy taste to it due to what I believe were old clams (remember this place is ON the ocean) and a perfectly prepared soft shell crab dish was one example of both how good and how bad it can be. Two areas I have found to be consistent consistent is great service and high prices. Which leads me to the reason I will never go back there, over dinner we drank wine, good wine list with a good selection of wines that included some good values but over lunch I was shocked to get our bill and be charged $5 for a glass of ice tea and $5 for a Diet Coke , yes read it again it is true, totally gratuitous! Being someone who has traveled the world and one more than one occasion spent over a thousand dollars on dinner for two, sticker shock is not something that that rattled me but FIVE DOLLARS for a glass of ice tea is unacceptable. Had the food all been fantastic I’d still be hard pressed to return but given the fact there are any number of places in the area to get MUCH better food at more reasonable prices that DO NOT PRICE GOUGE. Tell me it costs them more than .25 cents to produce the ice tea or the Diet Coke. When I questioned my server about it I felt sorry for her because clearly this has been brought to the attention of her as well as management on MANY occasions and typically the server bears the brunt of it when patrons tip. She indicated management just doesn’t care!",5
DO NOT go here and overpay for hit or miss food and WAY overpriced products.,5
Service was incredible . Very one from the start made every effort to make us comfortable .  Owner (I think was owner) introduced himself. ,5
Food was perfection. Limited menu which meant items were all cooked perfectly.,5
If I had any hesitation maybe Caesar Salad over dressed but still great. Bread at table perfection and so were wines and drinks.,5
"We had four different dinner. I had special Lamb Chops so good , one had porky chop, one pasta and one clams and pasta .  Not one person left anything on their plate. We will be back often.",5
Thank you for a lovely evening and dinner.,5
"This place was changed over from the Black Trumpet and it is a wonderful dining experience.  Seating is great anywhere, more room in the back.  We had two great appetizers and the fish was really well prepared.  Mike was our waiter and he had great advice on wine pairings. There were many specials available.   Top notch restaurant!",5
Sat outside and was told the nicer view tables were reserved though it was 5pm and we had asked for a good view of the icean when we made our reservation.  They ended up giving us the better table afterall. Food was mediocre but thr ambience good and ocean view worth it.,5
"Spent a lovely Fall afternoon having a delicious lunch on their porch. Chicken Parmigiana, Calamari, chicken/peppers/mozzarella grilled sandwich were all well prepared.",5
"Decently prepared but somewhat standard fare.  Service a bit unprofessional.  Inside seating can be very crowded.  Pricing was fair.  Two big complaints. (1) The list of daily specials was twice the length of the printed menu.  Why bother with a menu?  Of course, no prices given with the obligatory recitation of ingredients and technique by the wait staff.  (2) $25 corkage fee.  Unfortunately, some on line writings stated this was a BYO.  Of course we BYO'd.  Thought it unusual that they had a bar and BYO, but we acted on what we read.  The waiter and hostess did not bring the matter to our attention, opened our wine and (surprise!) there's the fee on the bill at the end of the evening.  That certainly put a damper on things.  We would gladly have put the wine aside and ordered from the bar had the waiter only mentioned it upfront.",5
Food and service were very good.   I would certainly go back again,5
Food excellent service good the only draw back was noise level impossible to have a conversation,5
"Second time there. Excellent food. Noise level can get loud but other than that, I highly recommend trying.",5
"The food, atmosphere and the service were excellent .. This will be are go to restaurant  whenever we come back to Spring Lake..",5
"Great place to enjoy a special dinner, ambiance, food, service all make this a top notch restaurant.",4
"The owner Liam was most accommodating, very pleasant to speak with and made us feel right at home.",5
A must try while visiting Spring Lake.,5
"Had a wonderful evening with friends.  Great food, drinks and atmosphere.  Not rushed.",5
It was great,5
Excellent food and service. Enjoyed by entire party of 5. Enough food for leftovers the next day.,5
"Too much noise, like most restoraunts, bars, and grills",4
Great food at a reasonable price.,5
Been going there for a few years and always have a wonderful meal,5
Solid tasty food with big portions.  We could have shared our entree.  Friendly service and nice owner who was onsite.,5
Good food at a reasonable price. Nice portions. Friendly wait staff.,5
Food was great!,5
Excellent food.   Friendly service.  Reasonable prices.  Definitely recommend.,5
"I went to this restaurant expecting a good meal. I have dined here in the past before it was remodeled and it is definitely not the same. First, my waiter was clueless and that's putting it nicely. We ordered two cokes and they had a weird taste to them. I figured out what it was when I went to the restroom. The water from the restroom faucet smells like pure rust, so bad in fact, that soap would not get the smell off my hands. I ordered veal parmigiana, which was ok, but my girlfriend ordered pork chops pizziola which were charred black and tasted like a dirty grille. So, all of this and on top of the waiter having no personality, made for a horrible dinner. I will not be going there again!",5
Met a friend who worked in the area for lunch .... and it was miserable cold weather.... the soup was excellent!!!!!!  And the quesadilla was satisfactory. ,5
"Loved our waitress, and cleanliness of establishment!",4
Went for Valentine's Day.  Table was waiting for us and food was great as always.  Staff was running around but was attentive to our needs.,2
"Fantastic place to eat! Great food, even better people working there!It's our favorite lunch place. We we go for dinner and we always have great food too!",4
An average experience.,4
Just finding the entrance from the parking lot was a challenge. The restaurant is located in a multi-use building with shops and what appear to be offices. The restaurant entrance requires passing a poorly marked sign and then several storefronts.,3
"When I entered and approached the unsmiling hostess to announce that I had a reservation, she gave the impression of being unhappy that I arrived.",2
"Our waiter was a bit brusque and overbearing. We were asked twice within the first few minutes if we wanted to order appetizers and then repeatedly if we wanted ""beverages"", even after wine had been ordered.",2
"The food was certainly very nice, but the overall experience will not one that will cause me to return.",5
"been here many times,the steaks arevery good ,cooked to perfection. great menu besides steak.  always a favorite place to go with family. new york atmosphere and new york style steaks",5
"The service was very good from the wait staff, average from the hostess staff ...",5
"Good was good , very loud could not talk or hear the waiter! I understand there is a lot of people but it was extremely loud.",5
"Our Filet Mignon and lobster were cooked to perfection!  The service as always was perfect....  very attentive, polite and courteous!!  Have been going here for the last 2 years at least once per month. Never been disappointed!!!!",4
It was great. Beautiful place.,4
Staff overall all was great and helpful. Maitre d was a bit stiff but the rest of the staff was friendly,4
and helpful & the food was quite good and cooked perfectly. Have had a better steak  (cowboy) but only a couple of times. The cut was as described but a bit on the thin side 1.25 inch not the ,3
"2"" I cook for myself when I buy them.  Looking forward to going back and trying the Sea Bass.",4

"We had a wonderful meal at Rails. The staff was great, the General Manager spoke to every table to be sure everything was great.  I've never seen such a beautiful space, loved the wood, stone and glass.  Loved the Speakeasy, the ""cheese room"" and just wondering around the restaurant.  I'll go again for sure!",4
My mom really enjoyed her meal.  We bought her there to say Thank you!,5
"Before coming here the knock was that, for a steakhouse, the steaks are just ok - but people keep going back for the appetizers and other specialties.  I have to say I agree.  Overall, the food was very good.  But for steak, there are definitely better places with a similar or lower price point.",5
"We love Rails and celebrate all special events here and tonight was no different. Spectacular food, service, and everything else from beginning to end!",5
"Great steak, large portions and a good wine selection.  What else could you ask for?",5
Birthday lunch,5
recommend the filet mignion that was on special that day! great recommendation and great service,5
"Great food, great service",5
We wanted a table in the dining room they said there weren’t any we made the reservation 2 weeks prior. They sat us st the bar at a high top. We were celebrating our 13 wedding anniversary we ordered dessert I thought they would send a decorated  place. We were so disappointed,4
Great food.  Reasonably priced. Great service.  Nice ambiance.,4
"We live Rails. We go there at least twice a month. Food is always top notch. Crab cake app. French onion soup is 5 Star. My wife lives the cowboy steak, ny strip for me",5
"Brisket Mac n cheese, blue cheese au gratin potatoes.  Mmmmmmmm",5
The good and service were absolutely incredible. The fig & blue cheese flatbread was outstanding. On par with pizza in Italy. The steak of course was phenomenal. Would definitely recommend to a friend !,4
"Overpriced and bland, tasteless food. The only good thing was the service and the comfortable seating. Will not go back.",5
"Amazing as always! Steaks are unbeatable. Quality, taste, and perfection cooking as always. We love Rails and always come for an amazing meal and the afterwards bar/ambiance. Such a great beautiful place! Big thank you to the hostess who sat us earlier than our reservation! Keep on smiling front desk :) such friendly ladies who always want to help their customers.",5
"Firstly, woman at the check in desk was extremely rude, didn’t look up or acknowledge me till I held the restaurant’s text alert that my table was ready in her face. ",5
"Mixed drinks were all wrong, weak and not at all as they should taste.",4
Lobster cocktail for $17 was 2 small strips lobster. Seriously.,5
Steaks were all wrong- rare was well done; medium well was raw. Sides were cold and bland - blue cheese gratin; steamed spinach; asparagus - steer clear. Didn’t order dessert for myself because staff was told to please bring cake w/a candle. NOTHING. ,5
KICKER: valets gave us the WRONG TICKET. So now we have to stand outside in 10 degree cold while they search. Dude! You literally have ONE job.,5
"Very disappointing birthday dinner, will NEVER be back.",5
The food was excellent and the staff very friendly and helpful.,4
"I sent my daughter and her boyfriend. Their review is as follows! ""Amazing food with a great atmosphere! We ordered the NY Prime Strip (best steak I ever had) the crab gnocchi(amazing flavor) a side of Brussel sprouts, and the tuna tartare(incredible). Everything was wonderful, outstanding !!  The portions are very generous (we left very full, very satisfied, and still had leftovers to take home for later). In terms of the atmosphere, the restaurant is beautiful !!!!  there were also two live acts - one upstairs and one downstairs. Overall great experience!!!!! Can't wait to come back east to visit again!!",5
Being from NYC I consider myself a steakhouse snob.,5
I know what a good restaurant is and I find myself annoyed with most Jersey restaurants.,3
I loved everything about Rails.,5
"John our server was professional, pleasant and timed everything perfectly.",5
The wagyu strip was perfectly cooked medium rare.,5
From someone who knows I am telling you that this place is Great.,5
There aren’t too many Jersey restaurants that I praise but this is definitely one of them.  ,5
I will be back!!!!!!,5
"We have a great experience for our anniversary dinner on a Saturday night. Our server was very pleasant and helpful. The food was outstanding. We had the tuna tartar and calamari appetizer, he had the 24oz t-bone special and I had the filet mignon cooked perfectly medium rare. We also enjoyed the sauces but the steaks were so tasty they really didn't need them. Along with dinner we got truffle fries and asparagus which were large portions to share. Both were nothing special but delicious non the less. After eating such an amazing steak  I did not think it could get much better until I tried the ""half-baked"" brownie... OMG.  We will definitely be back here for another date night or night out with friends. I highly recommend making a reservation especially for dinner on the weekend because this place was very busy by the time we left. Seems like the secret of this gem is out.",5
"We really enjoyed everything at Rails. The food was very good and we loved the big menu. They have a much better selection than most steak houses. The main reason I didn't give 5 stars was because of the hostesses. They were rude on the phone, and in person not much better. They barely greeted us and didn't even smile. This is your first impression walking in and they were borderline rude.",5
"It was great! We had been wanting to go for a while, but were not able to get reservations. Finally I tried for a Tuesday night, which happened to be my fiance's birthday and we were able to get in! We were not disappointed - the food and drinks were great, and the service was excellent! Thanks so much :)",5
"Have been here a number of times. Great steak, I recommend the cowboy steak. Live music in the bar upstairs and the speakeasy downstairs is pretty cool too.",5
Excellent service... sides were cold.. we didn't complain because steak was served at the same time..,5
Had a 4:15 reservation New Year's Eve.,5
Seemed like they were not quite ready for us when we arrived.,5
Ordered a steak.,5
I wanted it well done but not charred. It was burnt to a crisp.,5
Service was so-so. ,5
We texted the valet when we were getting ready to leave but our car wasn't there when we got outside. It was freezing out.  I should have parked it the lot and walked.,5
We've had better experiences there.,5
Dennis,5
Steaks and service were superb!,4
Beautifully crafted restaurant. Food is very good and service is as well. Might be a bit on the pricey side and for that it's not a restaurant to frequent often. For special occasions it's an excellent choice.,2
"We had a lovely and wonderful night, food was amazing and service was excellent.",2
"Came here to celebrate a friend's birthday.  All of our dishes were carefully prepared and extremely good.  I had the marinated skirt steak and it was cooked beautifully.  My friend had a filet and lobster tail that were both cooked to perfection.  We both ordered the stuffed baked potatoes as sides..so delicious.   My daughter had a pasta dish with crab meat that she thoroughly enjoyed.  When the server discovered that we were celebrating my friend's birthday, he provided her with her dessert on the house...a very generous piece of a ten layer chocolate cake!  Scrumptious!  We all look forward to coming back to Rails! The atmosphere is lovely as well as the decor.  The serving staff were very polite and accommodating.  I would definitely recommend this upscale steakhouse to others.",3
"Party of four for dinner. Very nice atmosphere..Much to noisy at dinner time. Pass, if you intended to bring older family members. Your evening will be miserable. I could hardly converse with other people. It seems when busy the service takes a nose dive. Food was very good but over priced. I have been here for lunch and it was far more enjoyable and less hectic. Service definitely did not match the upscale ambiance and price of this resturant. Wait service was the biggest issue on our visit. To compare, Ruth Chris stake house in Parsippany on my last visit, was bend over backward on service with fantastic wait staff.",5
"The meal was fantastic. What a great value for the price. The wait staff, probably the best in the business!",5
"Was finally greeted by our waitress after being seated for 10-15 min. Right after she came by and we out our drink order in another waitress came by greeting us telling she would be our server and asking what we would like to drink. Overall they were confused. Waited about ten minutes for water - not ok.The apps were good .To start we got the burratta, New England clam chowder, and simple salad. All of which came out well prepared. We ordered two cocktails from the menu that was provided but upon receiving are cocktails was told we couldn't order any more of them because we ""were given the wrong seasonal cocktail menu"" and the bartender ""did what he could"". Fine, but another example for which service and confusion on their end can be tightened up. My husband ordered the filet and I had the skirt steak with a side of chimichurri. His was very good and mine was very bad. We also had the truffle fries that were very good. ",5
Additional Side notes on service - we were never checked up on by our server but rather always had to scan the room for anyone in order to get more water or a glass of wine. My steak came out sans chimichurri sauce so had to wait to find a server to bring that. My steak was prepared rare not medium as requested so I'm unsure if that was a chef issue or the waitress wrote down my request wrong.,5
First of all the woman greeting us asked us for our name three times and took two phone calls in between checking us in.  They we were seated at the smallest table in the Mosaic room for two.  I asked to move and the lady seating said she needed to ask and never returned.  The table  sat empty the entire time we were there.  The waiter never asked how my husband steak was. If it was cooked to his liking.  We were served some one else's appetizer and it sat there for a good minute before they came and took it and reserved it t the right table  It was there so long we thought it was  a free appetizer and we were picking up our forks to eat it.  The waiter did not give me any sugar or offer me sugar when he served me my cappuccino.   The Cowboy Steak was good my gnocchi was OK.  For the price we did not get the service and will not return.  Oh and the Mosaic room was so loud we could not hear one another.   I did not pick that room they just sat us at the smallest table they had.  Will not return.,5
"One of the most romantic, beautiful places in the area in a ski lodge setting. I guarantee you will not be disappointed!!",5
Continues to be a staple for an enjoyable and romantic night out. The food and service is unbelievable. A must go.,5
It's our new go-to.  I still can't decide what's better - the food or the service!!!,5
This is one of the best places I've eaten in a long time. Foodies will love this place. Hats off to Chef Daniel and the whole staff for executing a perfect dinner. It was so hard to choose what to eat tonight and the menu changes all the time.,5
"We have been back 4 times now and we have not been disappointed yet. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable and engaging. The food is creative and delicious. A much needed alternative to the blah Old Bridge dinning scene.",5
Excellent service and amazing food!,5
A dining experience like I never had before.  The service and food were excellent.  I really enjoyed being able to watch the chef prepare the meals in the open kitchen.  The stadium seating for the cooking class made me want to go back to school.  The boutique was laid out among the tables and sold an eclectic assortment of kitchenware.  For a unique and delicious experience I highly recommend Heirloom Kitchen.,5
We had a perfect meal and a perfect evening. Can't wait to go back. Thank you!!,5
"Creative, delicious and well designed restaurant. The food is spot on but they need to work out the timing. Dinner dragged on a bit. We were there for 3 hours. Still highly, highly recommend.",5
"My husband and I LOVED Heirloom Kitchen! We wish there was one closer to us in the Red Bank area. This place is something we desperately needed! Great food, great wine and drinks. We will be back again and again. :)",5
"The staff was great, very welcoming and friendly. The food waa amazing.",5
"We found about Heirloom Kitchen by chance.  Finally, a unique restaurant in Central NJ, that has style, class and not your run of the mill place.  Great Food, the service was fantastic.  Great concept of a truly unique open kitchen. You can watch the chef cook your meal and converse with him.",5
Excellent dining experience!!!  I would highly recommend it!,5
Enjoyed our meal. Perfectly seasoned nice size portions.  I would definitely recomend it!,5
"My husband and I decided to try this place after seeing the review in the Star Ledger.  We loved everything!  The ambience is laid back, friendly and most importantly quiet...we could talk to each other without screaming.  It is amazing that they actually make everything here including the butter which was delicious with the sourdough bread...well worth the $5.  For appetizers we shared the kale salad with goat cheese wontons and walnuts.   It was wonderful but for $14 I expected the portion to be larger since the review said it was large.  For entrees I  had the duck breast and hubbie had the sweet fennel sausage with homemade ricotta gnocchi's.  My only complaint was my plate and the veggies were cold:  I told the owner they need to heat the plates and she said I should have sent it back!  Duck was cooked perfectly and all the flavors were on point.    For dessert we shared the winter citrus curd with pistachio meringue - tart and light just the way I like my sweets!  The French press coffee was sooooo good!!!  I highly recommend this place - we cannot wait to go back and I look forward to taking a cooking class soon too!",5
This is a new restaurant and we were so impressed by the service and food.  Cynthia was great and built our excitement for the food.  The chef came to the tables to which was a nice touch.  The food tasted amazing and the presentation matched.  We can't wait to go back.,5
Loved the bright airiness of the dining room. With every course the food got more amazing. The mushroom/duck confit and the sour dough bread were fabulous. The grouper and the duck entrees are not to be missed. Service is friendly and helpful. The charming staff is deservedly proud of their restaurant because the chef creates magic right in front of you with each dish he creates. Can't wait to return.,5
"Absolutely outstanding in every respect! The food was phenomenal, particularly the duck. Service was exceptional. Cannot wait to return.",5
You will never go wrong here. Call after making rez and request the chef's table. They are amazing to watch!!!,5
"Awesome concept with enthusiastic owners, chefs and servers. We walked away thrilled to find an awesome spot near by. Unpretentious and delicious. We have already made reservations to return!",5
"Great innovative place. Open kitchen, friendly staff and service. BYOB but they can supply virgin cocktails and showcase for specific winery. Food was fresh, inventive, and delicious. Got to talk to owner, chef, and wait staff about the place. Can't wait to go back!",5
"My wife and I have been meaning to try out Heirloom Kitchen since they started offering dinners in addition to their awesome cooking courses. What a treat. Exceptional service. Even though we decided not to sit with the Chef (which is no additional cost, you just need to call the restaurant and make sure there's room alongside your reservation) we still got to talk with him. Very friendly, fun, and romantic. Not to mention, the food was ridiculous. Delicious.",5
We've been for both a cookie get class and new years dinner and both were great!,5
Chef Viana is incredibly talented and the food we enjoyed was perfectly prepared. Fun concept of sitting at the counter in the open kitchen. We were directly in front of the cooking team as it worked on our dinner.,5
Overall we had a great experience at Heirloom Kitchen. The food was not only delicious but very creative. The staff was knowledgeable and very pleasant.,5
The food was fab....the service was amazing....we had a great time! The chef is a true talent and the food tastes as good as it looked! Did I mention the bread? It's legendary! The owner came over to the table to make sure everything was just so...Great energy!,5
"OUR EXPERIENCE FOR THE FIRST TIME DINING WAS EXCEPTIONAL  FOOD,SERVICE, FRIENDLY, ATMOSPHERE, WOULD DEFINATELY RETURN.",5
"The restaurant is charming and cozy. The owner, Neilly Robinson is sweet and friendly. Chef David is super talented- the food is absolutely delicious. ( Neilly makes the sour dough bread and butter- scrumptious!) Overall a wonderful experience.",5
"The folks over at Heirloom Kitchen really know what they are doing. Food is unique and tasty, service is excellent and the ambiance is both open yet cozy. Great job!",5
"I've been to Heirloom Kitchen before for there amazing cooking classes and was excited to try the new dinner service. It was everything I was hoping for and more! We sat at the chef's counter and got an up close and personal look as our dishes were being prepared. The chef was very friendly and answered all our questions as he was preparing dinner. The wait staff was extremely friendly and helpful...our group never went without something we needed. As far as the food you have got to put this place on you're must try list. We started with their homemade bread (delicious), split a few appetizers, each got an entree, and finished the night with both of their dessert offerings. Every single item on every single dish was prepared artfully and cooked to perfection. Everyone in my group was raving about the food at this place! Will definitely we visiting many more times!",5
Absolutely amazing!!   Staff is incredible and food is out of this world. I want to go every weekend AND take every cooking class available. Great for groups or date night. Be sure to request the chef's table!!,4
"We had the pleasure of dining at Heirloom Kitchen on Friday.  Fabulous meal, great wine and awesome service.  All of the staff, especially Chef David are passionate about their food and it shows.  We'll definitely be back!",5
Everything was simply amazing! A foodies dream♡,5
"So happy a beautiful, delicious restaurant finally opened at the shore.  Loved every bit of our dinner experience, every appetizer especially the burrata, all the pasta dishes and the pork dish was out of this world.  The food, attentive service & beautifully designed restaurant was like we were in a trendy, upscale restaurant in NYC ,but at the beach.  Amazing experience.  Thank you for opening this gem!!",5
They take perfect care of you so you feel immediately welcomed. Second time dining there and can’t wait to go back.,5
As always a lover experience & delicious food!,5
"Amazing - the food, service and ambiance were all first class.  We loved the entire experience.  It was our first time at Larimar and we were delighted.  Will return soon.",5
Larimar has great food and service. Very attentive staff and owner personally speaks to guests which is a nice touch. Great for a special occasion or dinner wirh friends or family. It's a small intimate setting.,5
A  true Gem of the Jersey shore! We love this restaurant and will go back often. Treasures like this should be cherished!,5
First time visit. Food and service was outstanding.  Staff was very friendly.  Will be back,5
Always great!! Best  anywhere around!,5
"I’m not sure what was better: the atmosphere, the service, the people or the food. My new favorite restaurant.",5
I loved it....great staff and excellent food.i came from New York and I must say it was worth the drive,5
The atmosphere was elegant but not too stuffy...the service was unbelievably top notch as if you were in a New York dinig room and the eas so delucious. The staff snd owners were friendly and accommodating...can hardly wait to dine there again.,5
"Once again we had an excellent dining experience at Larimar.  Every time we come here we do so with anticipation for their excellence in cuisine, which is treated as an art form.  The scallop with the chorizo and seared octopus appetizers, were above and beyond, and the split pasta course of Casarecce and Campenelle also awesome.  At this point we know the menu well, and although the seared Duck Breast and Pork Chop were up to Chef Dan Meadows par, the flat iron steak, with the espresso white chocolate risotto and kale was truly a treat, and this trip, the best meal at the table, where all meals were 5 out of 5.  Again, thank you, this restaurant is truly a hidden gem in Monmouth County.",5
Great Dinner!  All four courses were fantastic.  The flat iron steak was tremendous and the pasta was the best I have had and the portions were good for four courses.,5
Awesome meal.,5
A truly excellent dining experience.,5
"From the moment we walked in, the staff was pleasant and helpful.",5
The dining room was quiet and comforting.,5
The menu was limited but with enough to choose from and be very satisfied.,5
Nothing like all the food arriving at the same time and all the empties removed at the same time!,5
An overall 10.,4
First time here and the food was great.  Service was very attentive throughout our stay.  We will definitely be back.,5
Great fine dining in the area,5
Food was excellent and the staff were very attentive and professional.,5
"Larimar is worthy of its lofty reputation! The food and service are as good as anything available on the Jersey Shore and that’s saying something since our little corner of the world has become a gastronome’s  delight. Come one, come all to Larimar!!",5
Every time I eat here I am impressed. The food was once again fantastic. The atmosphere and customer service is impeccable.,5
"Good food, and good atmosphere.  The menu on open table does not coincide with the menu at the restaurant.",5
Larimar is a real gem. New York city quality food & service near the Jersey shore.,5
"...every element of our dining experience was excellent, I highly recommend Larimar.",4
Best pork chop I ever had.  Decor is beautiful also in a very nice little town.  I think a little music is warranted.  Needs a little livening up.  I will be back,5
"Not our first visit to this lovely restaurant, and certainly not our last.  Food, service and decor are all exceptional.  Waiter, Kevin, was knowledgeable and quietly informative without interrupting our dining experience.  Larimar makes dining elsewhere is to settle for less.",5
Great food and terrific service and atmosphere. We will return the next time we are in NJ,5
"What a surprise to find a great looking, New York style restaurant in Spring Lake! A great experience all around, beautiful design, high end food, great service and wonderful hosts. And did I mention the bread?",5
The wait staff was tripping over each other they did not seem experienced for the price of the restaurant. I make more interesting salads a lot cheaper. Entree was good but for he prices they charge should have been wonderful,5
"This was by far the best food I've had in sometime, and the staff made it an overall enjoyable experience, I would highly recommend Laramra!",5
"Love this restaurant. One of its kind in the area. Elegant, delicious and spot on service.",5
"Larimar is the most extraordinary fine dining experience on the Jersey Shore. I recommend it highly for a special occasion. If you have not already enjoyed a dinner at Larimar, I suggest you make it your next culinary stop.",4
"A step above both in cuisine and class.  There are not many places like this at the shore and if you have even a slight issue, they fix it with a smile on their face. Attention to detail and execution is paramount at this excellent restaurant.",5
"It really doesn’t get much better than Larimar.  We’ve been there a number of times and it continues to be an amazing experience.  It’s rare to leave a restaurant time after time feeling that you just experienced a perfect meal...and it continues to happen each time.   Thank you again for providing excellent service, memorable entrees, and an overall perfect evening.",5
So happy to have a NYC quality restaurant in our town!,5
As good as any restaurant in NYC. Perfect place for a date or special dinner,5
"Always a great mean, always great service and always a great time!",5
"This is the second time my wife and I have visited the restaurant and it’s amazing every time we visit. The staff is friendly and welcoming. Very accommodating and making sure you are enjoying yourself and your meal. It’s quiet and great for a date night or with a group of friends or family. Nice portion sizes of food. It’s a nice neighborhood gem in the Spring Lake, NJ area.",5
"As always:  great service, delicious food and wonderful ambiance.  John and his staff let us stay until we finished our wine even after all other customers had left and it was time to clear the dining room.",5
"Impeccable service, staff, cuisine and ambiance! Makes you feel like a superstar guest!",5
Not a fan of prefix restaurants...Serenade has an extensive menu and large portions I give this restaurant five stars,5
One of my favs : doesn’t disappoint .  Bar area cozy for drinks and lighter fare .  Dining is always special,5
Service was excellent and food was delicious. The perfect dirty martini.,5
"This is truly a special jewel. It has been at the top of the list for NJ fine dining for many years and is consistently superb. The quality of the food is always top notch, the service typically strong, and the atmosphere very comfortable. The mark of greatness is consistency- Seranade hits that mark.",5
"the food is VERY GOOD, I said outstanding in the review above.  i spent almost $300 on the tasking menu for 2 people,  with wine pairing.  Consider everything GREAT expect for the following;  it was very noisy, it is like you are in bar in terms of noise level.  I have been to Le Bernardin,  Scalini Fedeli,  Per Se, etc.  This is the noisiest. I know it is Saturday night and it is jam packed even at 8pm.   I know they would not want to reduce the tables, but if they could invest in adding sound absorbing carpeting, wall covering maybe it would help.  ",5
"Service I had James who was very, very nice explained each wine for each pairing.  However service was rushed partly by him but generally too.  I had to ask the Bread person 3x for a 2nd serving.  She was running around from table to table and forgotten each time i asked.  One course, the lamb was brought by the kitchen staff(i think..person wearing complete white), i guess James was busy, but in any case because James did not bring the meal, the wine pairing was missed.  It took at least 5 minutes for me to see him and stop him, He apologized and brought the wine.  These are the things that when you are spending $300 for 2 people should Never Happen !.  I would suggest they add at least a few more Server type people to slow and even out the service",5
Charming place in downtown Chatham. Small Prix fixe menu with tasty options. Short rib tortellini appetizer was delicious.,5
"Serenade is a great neighborhood restaurant with an upscale feel, so works for business, but also casual enough for a low key get together with friends.  Wine list is good for a neighborhood restaurant and food is always good.",5
"We are usually good for one or two meals a year at Serenade. We celebrated my birthday last week and opted for the tasting menu with wine pairings and as usual they didn't disappoint. limited courses make for a heartier meal with diverse tastes in both the food and wine. Service as always was impeccable!! If you haven't yet dined there I highly recommend it, especially for a BIG occasion.",5
The food and wine at Serenade are always great and we have been going there for years.  One quibble I do have is that the service was less than expected for such an expensive meal.  We ordered the market tasting menu with wine pairings and for each course there was a 5-10 minute difference between when the food came out and when the wine pairing was served.  The coordination of the food and the wine are important in order to enjoy such a meal.  Our soup was going cold while waiting for the first wine and then for the second course our wine came way ahead of the food.  And so on.  With a two ounce pour it is difficult to manage that as a customer and frankly we shouldn’t have to.,5
Fine dining beautifully served good selection very pretty place overall great..,5
"The service overall was very good, with the exception managing the two undercooked fish entrees we ordered (must have been the chef's first day attempting to cook seafood).   I chose to not have the same piece of fish returned to the pan, and my wife accepted the offer to ""cook it the rest of the way"" (is twice cooked fish a French technique?).  Dropping over $100 per person for my family of four, I'd fully expect my waiter to simply apologize and say, ""let me bring you a new entree"".  Instead, I was able to eat the cooked ends of the filet while my children ate their meals and my wife sat there awkwardly with no food in front of her.  Then we all got to watch her eat her entree that was returned once the rest of us were finished.  Lots of potential - big miss on ensuring a top tier experience. Not sure we'll be back.",5
"We had a very early reservation (because that was all we could get) to have dinner with a couple we had not seen for many years and, before we new it, we had been there for four hours.  We never felt rushed, the food was excellent, and the service was really good.  I think all four of us were very pleased with our choice of Serenade.",5
Serenade is perfection.  Service is always impeccable.   It’s been around for a long time.  It’s fine dining with a casual atmosphere.   Everyone is out of their way genuinely kind.,5
Food and service were impeccable. We will be back,2
"Serenade has consistently given us wonderful meals and wonderful evenings.  The setting and decor are lovely, the ENTIRE waitstaff is very competent, very professional, and provide a rare level of service that is very much appreciated.  Every dish on the menu is a delight and very artfully presented.  This IS ABSOLUTTELY a DO NOT MISS restaurant !!!",5
"Wonderful meal, excellent food, knowledgeable and attentive staff.  No complaints, no overdrawn amount of time waiting...perfectly timed.",5
"Food was excellent - harvest soup and short rib tortellini were excellent, and as others have said, the lamb rack was a hit....  very quiet (it was early Tuesday evening), but a very nice ambiance overall....",4
Another wonderful luncheon experience at Serenade.,3
The service professional and accommodating. The food delicious &  beautifully presented.,3
Looking forward to returning more often!!!,5
"We were there for our new year's eve dinner. It was a prefixed menu. The appetizer sampler and our second course were excellent. The main entrees (Fish, Beef and Lamb) were comme ci comme ca, nothing outstanding. The dessert sampler was good. The wines selected by the restaurant for pairing was okay...could be better. Overall, a good place for decent french food.",4
"Food and service was excellent as always. The only complaint we have is that the ambiance of fine dining is not enhanced by a bare wood table, sans linen tablecloth. This was standard in the past but sadly absent now.",4
The food and service are always good.    The decor desperately needs a facelift,4
My first time at Serenade and it was a very nice experience. The staff is very friendly and the food was very good. The ambience is romantic and is a great place to relax and enjoy quiet conversation with your loved one. I highly recommend it.,4
"We had been to Seranade times before and liked it. We went back for Christmas Eve dinner. I ordered a fillet medium, pink inside. They were my words. The steak came well done! I would have sent it back but did not want to hold up the rest of the table. I ordered the chocolate cake. The inside was pure chocolate syrup. I love chocolate but this was so sweet!  Long time before we go back.",4
"This is a very good restaurant with some unique dishes. The service is friendly and helpful,  but our waiter seemed a little unfamiliar with the details of dishes and struggled a bit to suggest a wine suited to my wife's request. Very nice guy, and otherwise a flawless server.",4
The decor is well done in a sorta retro-70's way....I like it.,3
"If I have one complaint, it's one of my standard ones: please offer more bread if bread plates are empty, especially if the appetizer hasn't even come yet. ",5
"A little pricey, but overall good value.",4
We'll be back.,5
Great place - highly recommend! Cool vibe - great service.,4
Enjoyed the tasting menu a few nights ago.  The soup was delicious.  The scallops were cooked perfectly.  The lobster was one of the best lobsters I have ever had in my life.  The texture and flavor of the shellfish dish was really incredible.  ,5
The service was spot on.  Very attentive without being pushy.  ,4
Highly recommend.  Going back soon!,3
Entire experience and food did not meet expectations or other fine dining experiences.,3
A favorite of my family. Service and ambiance amazing. The food is fantastic and the presentation is lovely. Will return soon,5
Serenade is our anniversary tradition (although we come a few other times a year as well).  Always impeccable service and excellent food choices.  The lamb is superb and the chef soup of the day is amazing.  Never been disappointed with a meal yet.  Seasonal local ingredients are interestingly intertwined into the preparations.  Wine list is very comprehensive and reasonable on price for this 5 star restaurant.,5
The food was delicious however the waiter told us we had to be out in an hour as they were sold out. It was very disappointing to be rushed without being told in advance that an hour was our limit for the table. I find an hour unacceptable for a restaurant of this caliber.,5
Everything was very good at Serenade.  I had read an article about the restaurant last summer and was looking forward to having dinner there.  It was all a bit too pretentious for my tastes and very pricey.  Not expecting to see members of the serving staff standing around in groups most of the evening.  All food was price fixed and that caught us by surprise . Had seen no mention of this when we looked through their menu through Open Table.  It was a one time experience.  Not planning on going back.,5
Second time back this month! This time had the dinner special-- hanger steak and short rib! Awesome!!! Finished the whole thing.,3
This is always my go-to restaurant.  Food in incredibly prepared and presented.,5
"Awesome, awesome food! I loved that it was Farm to Table! Great options as well! Definitely will be back.",3
"A truly iconic restaurant. Great service and creative, well prepared and beautifully presented food.  Extensive wine list with moderately priced options along with the special bottles. Short rib ravioli appetizer was both creative and comfortable. Striped bass over a lobster tomato risotto was as good as it sounds.",3
"Food was good...as always. Not our best experience, though.",5
Everything from the food to the service was perfect. We went there for thanksgiving dinner and had a delightful time.,4
"Our food was delicious, the service impeccable, and the room we sat in had a lovely fireplace blazing away.  The bar was pretty crowded the whole night, so I'll assume it's a good place to hang 🍸",5
"We've been here before and expected nothing less than perfection! We were not disappointed.  I love the decor and atmosphere, the staff is exceptionally professional and friendly, and the food as usual was fabulous! Definitely one of the best in the area! Looking forward to our next visit!",4
"My wife’s fish was undercooked.  They merely reheated it without so much as an offer of a complimentary dessert.  Waiter stumbled through the specials, clearly distracted by the regulars at the next table.  At $40 an entree, best off going elsewhere.",5
Celebrated our anniversary - was disappointed  with the location of the table . right in the middle behind the servers and in front of the entrance to upstairs room.  Area was busy and not enjoyable for a special occasion dining.,5
