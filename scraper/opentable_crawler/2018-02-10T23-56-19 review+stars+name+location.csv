"Exceeded my expectations. Sophisticated, quiet. Waitstaff, food quality, ambience were perfect. Can’t wait to go back!",4,OpenTable Diner,Las Vegas
"Great chic downtown spot especially for lunch. Super cool design with elaborate artwork and the most divine green velvet chairs. Server was very friendly, every dish was superb &amp;  with nice selection of wines.  Don’t skip the  Fred Pressman salad.",5,ktcalla,New York Area
"A hidden gem I discovered on Open Table.  The food and service, in particular, were outstanding.",5,OpenTable Diner,Washington DC
Incredible like always,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"My go to place.  The best.  Such amazing, friendly staff — everyone’s like family!",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Two things that stand out: food and service. Ambiance is not offensive, rather bland, neutral, does make one feel being in a store, sort of. Having said that, the noise level is low, so it's great for conversation and that's a good thing, one can focus on the food, and one's company.  The food is actually quite good, tasty, but above all, abundant! The portions are huge! Who would have thought, at Barney's! And the service is exemplary, friendly, attentive, but not intrusive. Great for lunch or brunch!",4,gourmand,New York Area
Always a great time here,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
We wanted to order everything on the menu but we decided on the pizza a salad French fries and pasta and all was delicious! The bloody Mary’s were a bonus to our meal!,5,Deaglo,New York Area
"The food and service were truly outstanding; location is great for meeting.  I had a business lunch and was pleased with the atmosphere (although a bit commercial), but notable was both the food and service.",4,honeydoc624,New York Area
"Barneys has returned to Chelsea, and Fred's is operating a restaurant up on the third floor corner with attractive windows overlooking the corner of Sixteenth Street and Seventh Avenue.  Food and service are both quite good.  Prices are in line with New York City.  The room is attractive.  Since both the store and the restaurant are relatively new, it was relatively empty.  The result was a quiet room in which one could conduct a civilized conversation.  Will this last?  Hard to say.",4,NYGeek,New York Area
Chef was fabulous!!!,5,enjoyneworleans,Washington DC
Great staff - very friendly - food wonderful - really nice drinks - we always enjoy our visits to Freds at 7th ave,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Love the Sunday brunch relaxing vibe!,5,Monk,Miami
"A really nice experience - why, because the food and service were great and you could actually have a conversation!  Really nice vibrant paintings on the wall so it gave a nice artsy feel. Service was excellent too. Loved the zucchini chips and the salmon was quite good too.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
The ambience is lovely. Service was excellent! Lunch is always a treat.  A bit pricy but portions are large. Food is yummy and presented well. Loved the room. Very fitting for a restaurant at Barney's.,4,NZ2247,New York Area
"Foremost the entire staff is very upbeat, pleasant &amp; responsive to all requests. I even left my sweater &amp; received a lovely phone call stating my sweater would be held for me! Thank you!!!  I dined for restaurant week lunch &amp; loved it so I came back for dinner &amp; was disappointed a the menu choices were fewer &amp; the portions smaller.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Outstanding service! Restaurant week is on their menu and the value is terrific,5,OpenTable Diner,Birmingham
"I went to Freds at Barneys for restaurant week for an early dinner.  Usually I have lower expectations for any restaurant during restaurant week, but Freds was great! My friend and I both started with the avocado toast which was excellent. I had the chef's special which was a roasted salmon and my friend had the homemade spaghetti. Both were very good. The vegetables that came with the salmon were perfectly done and very tasty. We had sorbet and tiramasu for dessert--they were delicious as well. Our server, Jimmy was very kind and entertaining. He had excellent wine pairing recommendations as well.  We were a little under-dressed for the restaurant, but nobody made us feel like that was the case.",5,mountainhigh,Denver
A stellar addition to the Chelsea restaurant landscape.  Beautifully designed.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Service great Food great You can hear yourself even when busy,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Fred's at Barney's is a hidden gem in Chelsea. Tucked away in a corner of the third floor, it offers a stylish bar and slick upbeat ambiance featuring velvet banquettes and chairs. The menu is diverse and appealing. Service is excellent, with the wait staff knowledgeable and engaging. Happy hour specials feature Fred's signature thick hand cut fries. For a special treat and to people watch, hit their weekend brunch.",5,Markus,New York Area
Terrific food. Have eaten here many times. Very consistent.,5,StevieG,Los Angeles
Amazing food and service!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"very nice setting, very tasty, great service",5,localeater,New York Area
"Bright lights, boring dining room. Mediocre food. Posing host staff. A mural fit for a middle school. And a line for the bathroom. Checking this one off the list.",2,Pimienta,New York Area
"I was very pleasantly surprised that this was not just a pretty room.....and it certainly is that. The decor is beautiful, but the food was outstanding too!",5,DINETOEAT,New York Area
"Great restaurant and undiscovered gem in Chelsea!  Definitely worth trying for brunch or lunch, hip, stylish and great food.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
There was food on the chair where I placed my purse and the restaurant will not take responsibility for ruining it,1,OpenTable Diner,Philadelphia
"Fred's never fails to deliver.  The entire staff is excellent and the food is prepared perfectly.  If you are alone or with a few people it is a great, comfortable and enjoyable atmosphere to have a great meal",5,Chris,New York Area
"This is one of my regular brunch choices.  The service was very good; as always.  However, the food this time was okay; but definitely not to the standard of the past.  The presentation was definitely less; and the food quality was easily two stars less.  Avocado toast is always amazing.",3,dcspike,Washington DC
Loved my dining experience at Fred's downtown. Everyone of the staff members  were an absolute delight. The menu is sumptuous. They have a delectable cheese bread  ( Made in House) which paired superbly with my freshly made soup.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Great spot...not surprising. Everything was great but prices are very high, even for the caliber of restaurant and the Barneys setting.",5,GreatSpotNewCanaan,New York Area
"We often go to Fred's for brunch on the weekends.  Although it's a little pricey, the food and service are excellent so you get your money's worth.  The manager is very helpful and personable and the staff are professional and excellent.  The food is always great and it's a wide range.  Awesome salads, great eggs, wonderful salmon croquettes, famous pizzas and tasty mimosas.  Excellent desserts as well.  Good location in Chelsea - convenient to everything.",5,Chelsea123,New York Area
Always great here,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

Overpriced. Food is at most average,3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Service is great.,4,Foodies,New York Area
Way to expensive for the quality of food. The downtown Fred's needs to change their strategy as this is a different customer then Madison ave,3,JMicheal,Los Angeles
"was really excited to try l'artusi since i have heard great things - while the food was awesome, the noise level was earth-shaking (on a tuesday!). i could barely hear myself think, let alone hear the person across from me speak. was pretty disappointed as this was a special occasion. the atmosphere ruined what would have otherwise been a great experience.",2,clover,New York Area
Always great food!,5,OpenTable Diner,Las Vegas
This place is AMAZING!!!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I’ll keep it short and sweet.  OUTSTANDING!!!   Cheese, to Apps to Chefs Specials were just amazing.  Pasta was immaculate. Wine selection is immense!!   They have good beers and great cocktails.   Dessert was mouth watering.   Danielle was a joy as she gave us a great table, treated us like regulars and acknowledged our special night which was our 5th Anniversary.   I would let them cook every meal for me if I could.",5,dahijoka,New York Area
Food could have been better had high expectations and did not deliver.,3,OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 26, 2018"
The food is always the absolute best... worth making reservations a month in advance 🤗,5,OpenTable Diner,Miami
Food and ambiance are great Service was good.  My only commentary is that the dishes are brought out together ( in 2s or 3s) so inevitably the food gets cold. I assume they want everyone out the door as fast as possible.,4,anvasqu,New York Area
"Service was great, every food item that came out was terrific",5,OpenTable Diner,Orange County
"Strange decor and loud, inappropriate music detracted from a good meal and very good service.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Amazing place, fantastic food great waitress",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"It's not easy to get a reservation here, but well worth the effort. We came at opening time on a Monday night in January, and the place rapidly filled up. All severs were friendly, prompt and personal. Cocktails were generous,  appetizers (tuna tartare and hamachi) were wonderfully seasoned and sauced. We had been told not to skip the pasta course (good advice) and the cavatelli with wild boar ragu and pappardelle with white Bolognese were to die for. Combined with glasses of Barbera d'Asti, we shared the spicy grilled octopus, also excellent. Then we forced ourselves to try the excellent desserts and coffee. Hazelnut tart with hazelnut gelato and warm, crisp apple tart with buttermilk gelato sent us on our way. Fantastic meal.",5,MaryJ,New York Area
"superb food and experience, highly recommend. tough to get a reservation though.",5,IFCay,Caribbean
My husband and I went for brunch. It was a great meal. The service was good and so was the food.,4,Brunch,New York Area
One of the top restaurants in the city. I loved the atmosphere and food.,5,OpenTable Diner,Miami
Food wasn't that good way too rich,3,OpenTable Diner,Los Angeles
"This was my 5th time at L'Artusi... enough said!  My boyfriend and I love this restaurant and come here for practically every special occasion.  Reservations are hard to come by, so I recommend booking now for next month.",5,Carly,New York Area
"L'Artusi exceeded our expectations! We went for my boyfriend's dinner, and the servers treated us so well. We got free tastings of their carrot soup and beet ravioli. The olive oil cake for dessert was the right move. All in all, impeccable food, service and ambiance. A top choice for Italian in the West Village.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Great pasta but the staff messed up the bill so it left a bad taste,4,MichaelC,London
Always consistent - fabulous.,5,WG58,San Francisco
Great service and food. Fabulous atmosphere and great help with food and drink selection.,5,OpenTable Diner,Austin
"I’ve been dining at Il’Capriccio for years and I still love the food, service and ambiance. It’s the best Italian restaurant in New Jersey.",5,ANNAMARIEM,Dined 4 days ago
"I’m wife gave me a gift of dinner at L’Artusi for my birthday. What a treat! This is a great Italian restaurant. Food is prepared tapas style, but the portions are large. We had red Kale salad and mushrooms to start. The kale salad was exceptionally good as were the mushrooms, prepared with mild chili and a poached egg. We then had cavatelli with wild boat ragu and broken squid ink pasta with tuna and puttanesca sauce. Both were excellent. We were stuffed but went for dessert—an apple tart. We would highly recommend this restaurant.",5,ElliotS,Miami
Favorite place in NYC,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"There's a reason this restaurant makes all the 'top italian' lists for New York City.  With its unassuming entrance you wouldn't know  from the outside what a great meal, upscale atmosphere and vibrant place this is. Its superlative in every way, the food, the ambiance and the service. Its not an easy reservation to get as its not huge, but worth trying a month ahead to score a table. Or try for a bar seat. And we always appreciate a restaurant that is on time honoring reservations, they know how to plan it out well. Very reasonable choices of wine by the glass or bottle and cocktails are not overpriced and neither is food. Knowledgeable waitstaff that describe the specials with details, managers that check to make sure everything is to your satisfaction. Yes, the tables are close together, but its a narrow space. Upstairs, the tables are a bit further apart.",5,NewYorkFoodie,New York Area
"Fantastic as always. Great wine list, excellent pastas, and fantastic mains. Go with the chicken as your main course. It’s the best you’ll have in town. For appetizers, the mushrooms are amazing as is the beef carpaccio. You can’t go wrong with anything on the menu, they’ve perfected it all. And the specials are also always a treat. Extremely consistent. Always a great option for a casual week night meal or a special occasion.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Unfortunately we went for a special occasion, my husband’s birthday, and rushed to get to our reservation on time.  When we arrived another patron was sitting next to our designated table (at the very very back of the restaurant), side by side next to his date so that he had to be asked to move when we arrived and he did so begrudgingly. Then we had to be subjected the entire dinner to his extremely LOUD voice and appropriate conversation and gestures with his date. Honestly the whole dinner and experience was ruined for my husband and for me. We couldn’t hear one another and if not for my husband being an extremely kind person who didn’t want me to say anything, I would have asked for our check after one drink. I had been so looking to dining there and now -Never again, L’Artusi.",1,CFCC,New York Area
"Fell in love with L'Artusi from the moment we stepped foot inside. The staff was very welcoming,  the ambience was energetic yet very romantic. Food was amazing and the service was equally s wonderful. Book in advance as I booked our reservation a month before our date.",5,OpenTable Diner,Phoenix
"Great way to end the year at L'Artusi.I highly recommend, food is consistent and service is excellent. Thanks Dan and Heather for a wonderful evening",5,NYERR,New York Area
"We had 2 pastas which were very good and a Hamachi appetizer which was good. However the  crispy sweet breads were either over cooked or re-heated and were not very good, to be kind. I order sweet breads whenever I see them on the menu and these were about as bad as I have tasted. So over all I would suggest avoid the sweet breads here and enjoy everything else which is pretty good and fairly priced. The service was also first rate.",4,barmike,Washington DC
"Consistently excellent. Tonight we had the wagyu tartare special which was spicy, rich and excellent.  Our waiter Dan was great. The restaurant has a fun yet elegant vibe.",5,NYERR,New York Area
"best food, best restaurant, lucky to know  this place",5,Seungeun,New York Area
Everything was absolutely perfect! Service was second to none and the food and wine were impeccable!!! Wish we could have eaten here 100 times to try everything on the menu! Some of the best pasta we have ever had! The olive oil cake is a must try!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"My experience at this restaurant was absolutely perfect and it was something I will never forget.  The ambience is beautiful, the wine list is spectacular and creatively and thoughtfully put together.  The service was extremely helpful, informative, and precise.  The food was spectacular in every way, everything was very well balanced and thoughtful, perfectly seasoned, and expertly executed.  The food just made me smile when i took a bite.   I was extremely impressed by every aspect at L'artusi.  The food, the ambience, the wine, the service all came together perfectly for an amazing and unforgettable experience.  I cannot wait to go back and would highly recommend.",5,Jessicas,Washington DC
Always seated on time (and with a nice greeting) for the reservation. One of our favorites and food tonight was excellent as usual.  Really like the addition of the delicate squash to the winter menu. brought friends who had never eaten there and they loved it too Highly recommend and reserve way ahead.,5,NYERR,New York Area

"I've been here multiple times all enjoyable until now. Food was cold, salty and felt rushed by the waiter. Unfortunately, I will not return ever again also I will not recommend this place to my friends or colleagues.",1,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I've been going to Il Capriccio since they opened in 1984. They NEVER disappoint. They are still one of the best restaurants I've ever been to. Their consistency on quality, service and attention to detail puts them in a category with a select few. Sal handles the front like an orchestra leader and is in constant motion, but never too busy to smile, stop by and chat. I live further away now, but it is more than worth the drive to go!  They are the gold standard!",5,Mg22,Atlantic City
"We had another wonderful evening at Il Capriccio. The staff is extremely professional and accommodating. For example, the Caesar salad prepared table side was a nice touch even though it wasn’t even on the menu. The steak was flavorful and cooked to perfection, better than most pretentious steak houses in the area, and the seafood pasta was incredible. Tony Grande and his staff know how to run a restaurant and we continue to look to Il Capriccio for special occasions or just a special night out. The piano player is excellent and adds to the ambiance as well.",5,njleopard,New York Area
This is our go to place whenever we are in the mood for a fantastic meal.  It is a bit pricey but well worth the expense.  We have never been disappointed. The décor is gorgeous &amp; the food never disappoints. Highly recommended.,5,VeryHappyFoodie,New York Area
"It is our restaurant of choice for any occasion. This time it was our 55th anniversary. The time before was New Year's Eve. Food is always delicious, service is always gracious and attentive , wine list selection well rounded.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

A wonderful overall experience,5,bnp4food,New York Area

"This was our 12th year celebrating the Holiday season at Il Capriccio in Whippany, NJ.  The food, service and hospitality was excellent, the décor was festive, and the live piano music set the perfect backdrop for a romantic holiday evening.  Start your own tradition, and join in the fun.  See you there soon ;-)",5,dwb2017,New York Area
Excellent Italian dining. Staff professional. Ambiance terrific. Going there next week again. Highly recommended.,5,ToniZ,New York Area
One of the best in Nj,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The price to go here is not worth it. The evening was fine. Food was good, atmosphere ok, but for the price not worth it. There are many local options that have better food, more attentive service and a more pleasant atmosphere for about the same price. We came on a night where the restaurant had two large parties that devoured the attention of the staff and made the ambiance tough. It was the not intimate special occasion (birthday) experience we envisioned. This was too bad as we had the same experience at this restaurant a few years ago and tried to give them another shot. We won't be back.",3,njmike,New York Area
"We took our your daughter (elementary age), and the management and staff were great to her and very good in general.  All of the food was excellent, and everyone in the family enjoyed it.",5,RayT,New York Area

"One of our favorite restaurants, over the last 4 years ourselves and 4 other couples celebrate New Year's Eve at Il Capriccio.  Great staff and also the bar staff, great group.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Service and food were fantastic.  Interesting, creative twist to traditional Italian.  Can't say enough about the fantastic service, from check-in to finish!  Only downside in my opinion was the music - too electronic dance-style for my taste.",4,OpenTable Diner,Philadelphia
Bustling and noisy but worthwhile for sure.  Staff was exceptionally nice and waiter was very attentive.  Food and menu selections were excellent.,4,Carol,Toronto
the food was very mediocre. the hip is bigger than the actual quality of the overall experience.,3,OpenTable Diner,Los Angeles
"When you dine here you always have a superb dining experience. You are treated in a special manner by all of the staff, that have refined customer service to an art. The food is exquisitely prepared, and the selections available make it difficult for you to decide what you will enjoy. It takes much thought to finally select your entire meal. The wine list is extensive, and excellent. If you are unsure as to what to order, call on Salvatore for assistance, and he will guide you. I cannot recommend this place enough. The family who owns and operates the restaurant knows what it wants, and how a restaurant should be run, and it is translated into reality. I highly recommend it.",5,Logistician,New York Area

"Il Capriccio met all of my expectations.   Have never had better food, and the attentive staff added to my enjoyment of the evening.

"We met our in-laws there for a belated birthday dinner for my brother-in-law,  My husband and I arrived early and had a drink at the bar.  The bartender was pleasant, apologizing for keeping us a few minutes, while he finished with another couple.  Our mixed drinks were perfect and served with a smile and friendly chatter.  The others at the bar were friendly.  We went to the table when the other couple arrived and our drinks were brought to us with grace.  Service was excellent.  The crowd is mainly middle to upper middle aged and there were LOTS of birthdays and anniversaries that night.  Lovely piano music accompanies your meal and the food is excellent.  I had the filet, which was a little undercooked for my request but, the meal was a little unique and quite tasty.  My husband and brother-in-law wanted Veal Parmesan, which was not on the menu but, the waiter had it made for them.  My sister-in-law had the salmon, which she loved and, we all brought home leftovers for lunch the next day.  I will also give special mention to the meatball appetizer which was DELICIOUS and, was separately plated so each of us got one meatball from the 2 appetizer orders.  Our waiter could not have been more pleasant nor more eager to service us impeccably.  The décor is the same as I remember from many years ago, when I was there on business.  Very classic Italian.  Nice space at your table and good space between tables.  Our second time there within a year and, we will go again.  It is not a cheap night out but, we enjoyed everything and felt it was worth the price.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Nice food, good wine list and attentive staff - we had a very enjoyable evening",5,ZJT1,New York Area
I picked this restaurant out from the NJ Top 50 restaurant list for my wife's birthday.  I put in the OpenTable reservation that it was my wife's birthday.    They remembered and brought a candle and sang happy birthday.  My first time here.  I'd go back in a heartbeat.   Very nice with very good service.  Excellent food.,5,njcoinguy,New York Area

Everything (other than a few of the deserts) was able to be made gluten free and the servers were so accommodating of both dietary needs and the early start to our show up town.

Magnificent,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Once again, Del Posto exceeded my expectations. I was concerned that it couldn't possibly live up to my first meal there which turned out to be the best dining experience I have had over many years and many locations. It is not a quick meal. With wine tasting it takes 3-4 hours for a 5 course + dinner.  Such a wonderful time and interesting, delicious food!",5,Lynnz,New York Area
"This place had a great food and excellent atmosphere. The staff was very professional. As we were from non English speaking country, we found what is written in the menu to be difficult to understand. We asked the waiter for help but the waiter’s explanation was also a bit difficult. I wish they could be a little more friendly to the visitors from abroad. But overall, we really enjoyed the time and the food.",3,KEAY,New York Area

Food service and ambiance were incredible. Waiters knowledge of menu was great. A really nice experience but you get what you pay for. 5 course dinner with a few bottles of wine was about $250 a person. Well worth it but not an every day thing,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

"We were celebrating my mom's birthday and we could not have picked a better Italian place for her (she's a highly discerning in her Italian food).  Service was accommodating, attentive, friendly  and professional.  The room is impressive but not intimidating.  Food was excellent and plentiful for the coursed meal.  Overall a great dining experience for our group, which included a 7-year-old.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

"From cocktails in the lounge to dessert this was an amazing meal and fabulous dining experience. Loved the uniqueness of every course, the amusee offered and especially the white truffle ravioli. Service was perfectly timed and most gracious.  Will definitely be back!",5,FabD,New York Area
There is a new space that was recently opened. They put all the larger parties there. On 8ft folding  long tables from Costco!!!  No one in that room was happy. Need round tables for groups like this. It was not fun to sit four per side. Too bright in there as well. No ambiance. Need to get this part together ASAP. Food was very good. Service a little scattered. Will go back but need to know the back room is changed.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
I love this restaurant and the owner is a lovely man who is really a foodie.  This restaurant has a good vibe and the service is terrific.. I come here at least once a week with my family or a date.  The food is amazing and the stuffed artichokes ate the best I have ever eaten...,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
We really enjoyed our dinner with friends at Cafe Venezia.  Food and service were both wonderful.  Highly recommend!,5,JanS,New York Area
Our party of 6 really enjoyed the meal.  The appetizers were delicious as were the main course and desserts.  We have been here at least a dozen times and we have always enjoyed our meals!!!  The staff and owners are very personable and very  accommodating.,5,APBurson,Philadelphia

"Our first time.  The food was very good and the portions very large.  The server was friendly and helpful with any special orders, like a change of pasta type.  The Broccoli Rapi was especially well cooked and flavorful.  We will be back!",5,Backdoc,New York Area
"We were a group of 15.  Initially res. Was made for 10, as open table does’t take more on the website. I  contacted the restaurant a week in advance to increase the number.   Upon arrival (res for 12:30),  no one greeted us, we were the only customers at the restaurant, our table was set, and we just took our sits.  In a while  a waitress showed, took some drink orders, but we had to ask for menus, non was offered.  Later  Leo, our waiter ( maybe the owner?)  took our orders, he was  friendly, however at 1:30, an hr after our Res., we only had our salads served. Very slow service, mix up with the orders.   The food was very good, portions fine, but service was slow, despite the fact  that there was only one other table occupied  beside our group. There was also a mix up with the bill, 2 extra plates were  charged, which we corrected.   All in all a mixed experience,   wouldn’t recommend it for larger groups.",3,Eurogirl,New York Area
We have been to Cafe Venezia at least 6 times and it never disappoints.   Food is always fresh.  Service is generally also great but this time it was a bit slow- took over an hour to get our entrees.  I’m guessing there was a mix-up but dinner was delicious as usual.,5,nanswm,New York Area

"I love this restaurant! I say it everytime but it’s my favorite. The food,the service and the  fact that it’s byob all of it is outstanding!",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"We've gone to Café Venezia three times now and haven't been let down yet. The owners and servers are friendly and attentive, the food is magnificent. The prices run somewhat on the  high side (but the food is worth it!) so it isn't a place we can frequent often - we reserve it for special occasions. All the pasta is ""homemade"" - we've had veal, chicken, seafood and meatless entrees and every one (so far) has been delicious. We're already planning our next dinner there with another couple.",4,DrKelso,New York Area
What separates this one from all the others is their attention to detail and most of all-  consistency! All too often a new restuant opens to sparkling reviews and immediately starts going downhill. The restaurant has been able to maintain absolutely fabulous meals for over 2 years now and still going strong.  Worth your while.,5,joeyvee99,New York Area
"We eat  at this restaurant weekly. What an amazing gem! The owners are friendly, care about their customers and treat everyone like family. The wait staff is excellent. The food is a gastronomic delight. ...a unique menu with interesting sauces, ingredients and preparations.... out-of the norm....Calamari for example.... prepared with their homemade sausage, cherry peppers and an interesting sauce, then placed in an edible basket.  The daily specials really are special! My husband has yet, to order off the menu. Fish is fresh daily and these specials are delightful. This is a must-go-to restaurant for foodies!",5,OpenTable Diner,Charleston
"The brothers that own Café Venezia are always involved with the entire dining experience. They greet, serve, and are genuinely concerned that every patron has a wonderful dining experience. The food is consistently well prepared and the ingredients are fresh. There is a wide variety of choices on their menu. And they always have interesting specials to offer as an option to the regular menu offerings. Eddie and Leo will always go out of their way to make Café Venezia your go to BYOB, fine dining restaurant.",5,Pacman,New York Area

"This was my second visit and it was even better than the first.  The hostess and servers/owners (3 brothers) were welcoming, conversational, attentive, and professional.  We shared the calamari appetizer, which was enough for the 4 of us.  I had a fresh fish special and the other 3 had various veal dishes, all of which were exceptional.  We'll certainly go back soon!",5,NJfind,New York Area

"In looking for a good BYO that would be a convenient location for our party of 7, I came across Cafe Venezia.  Considering the stellar reviews I didn’t think we could go wrong and we did not . Our table was ready when we arrived and we had plenty of friendly assistance from the staff.   A truly great lovely family that  is passionate about  their business . Being the foodies that we are, we were very critical and Cafe Venezia passed with flying colors on all courses.   Had a great meal and a great time and look forward to going back.",5,LinnieG,Charleston

im reluctant to go to any other restraunts when I have Cafe venezia ....,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
The high level of food and service was only exceeded by the owner's interaction with his customers,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I highly recommend this restaurant.  My husband and I live in Sparta NJ and travel at least once or twice a month to Café Venezia.  We always invite friends to join us and they love the restaurant as well.  Leo and Edi are the perfect hosts and always make us feel special.  They go  out of their way to prepare a vegan meal for our friend.  He enjoyed it so much we are going back next week.   The food is great, atmosphere wonderful, staff friendly and warm and we recommend it highly.",5,Linda,New York Area
"Café Venezia is a welcome addition to this area.  There have been other restaurants in this same venue which were good, but didn't make it.  The chef at Café Venezia is excellent and the staff is willing to make any adjustments that anyone may want.  We brought friends on this visit (our fifth) and they made reservations for next week after our dinner with some of their friends.  Keep it up!!",5,nanswm,New York Area
Honestly I had heard such amazing things about this restaurant. I tried for 6 months and finally grabbed a 6/30 reservation. The servers were great and attentive and the meatballs were wonderful but after that it went downhill. I did not care for my red snapper special and my client had the eggplant part which we were told everyone raves about but it was so so. Also both dishes came out Luke warm. I opted not to complain because it was a nice evening. I will give it one more try but overall disappointed,4,steakie,New York Area

Only problem with The Little Owl was it was only 20 degrees outside and they have no heat other than a small space heater.,3,PamW,"Dined on February 3, 2018"
"Our meal at the Little Owl was wonderful - as always when we visit.  The restaurant has become our favorite in Greenwich Village and, indeed, in NYC.",5,OpenTable Diner,Washington DC
"I really enjoyed my dinner at The Little Owl.  The service was very attentive and helpful.  The food was delicious.  I thought the portions for the main courses were a very good size, but the appetizers were very small and pricey.  For example, the appetizer portion of risotto is $38 and two small meatball sliders were $15.   Despite this, I would go back to the Little Owl and would definitely recommend to others.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
The food was absolutely incredible! Wonderful Cozy place with very attentive and friendly staff!!! Can’t rave enough and can’t wait to return!!,5,JoRiz,Western NC

Exquisite restaurant. Service and ambience impeccable. This was a wonderful dining experience,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

Outstanding !!!! My ny strip with pepper 🌽 dipping sauce was awesome 😎 sauce. Brownie for dessert was like heaven n my mouth full of flavors,5,meeka,New York Area
"Disappointing  overall experience. The ambiance, decor and initial service was lovely. However, things took a turn for the worse as the meal progressed.  A vodka collins cocktail was all soda water. Burger was great, but filet mignon was overcooked. After entrees were done, server was away for so long we no longer wanted to wait around for dessert. Considering the proper men's dress code and sleek Lauren ambiance, one expects better. This is a one and done for us.",2,LadyRedSoxFan,New York Area
This was the second time we’ve visited and it was the same great service and food as the first. This time it was a meal to celebrate our Sons first birthday and I was slightly reluctant about taking the baby as it was such a nice but small restaurant but the staff couldn’t have been any nicer or more welcoming. We’ll definitely be back again!,5,Joannep,New York Area

"Lovely food, very friendly staff. Feels like a comfortable neighborhood place with elevated food.  However...get used to the tourists taking photos!  We had no idea that the restaurant is in the building that the T.V. show ""Friends"" is known for.  Apparently, the exterior of this building is what was used for the opening of ""Friends"".  There's a constant stream of people across the way taking photos.  It was amusing.",4,mainelyfood,New England

Best meal I've ever had!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"We'd been waiting for a long time to get to the Little Owl, but since we travel in by train from NJ, it's been next to impossible to get a reservation, especially on the Fridays or Saturdays that we're in the city. We lucked out with the Monday holiday, and got the 'last' table available for reservations. So worth the wait! We'll work harder to get back. Incredible food, perfect service. Felt part of the neighborhood and so well cared for. Had a bit of everything from the menu - from cocktails, to wine, apps to salads, and even dessert. Went tapas style and Miriam guided us expertly.",5,ABrownNJ,New York Area
We arrived on Sunday morning for brunch. The room was so cold everyone had to keep their jackets on. My lunch was freezing and as I waited for the bathroom I saw one of the chefs stick his finger in one of sauces to taste it. Won’t be returning.,1,Newyorkee,San Francisco

The spinach was supper salty, fries were okay, veal was beyond mediocre.  However my rose was really good and that’s the only thing I liked.    Although I was so disappointed with my dinner I opted not to get desert, I would however recommend this place for drinks and dessert.    If you are the type to go to a place just to say you went.

Everything was perfect. The whole environment it is unique in nyc and is very friendly and common for European visitors. There was a problem with laud specking of some costumers and I believe that because you have a wonderful wine list the sommelier and his assistants they are not well trained for this list. Overall very good place.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"This is my 4th time at the Polo Bar. It is still very trendy but with excellent service. The food is not to die for but very good. The Ralph Lauren polo motif is lovely as well. It used to be a pain to reserve because you would have to call but now that it is on Open Table, it is much easier although I have never been able to get a table at a normal time like 7-8 only either very early or very late. Maybe they are saving prime time for the likes of Michael Strahan or Kelly Ripa. The bar is also extremely pleasant for a before cocktail or after dinner drink . It's reservation only though both for the bar and dinner. No walk-ins unless you are someone important I guess.",5,ChrisK,Raleigh
"i had been waiting for the right time to get a reservation at the polo bar and an early dinner on christmas eve proved to be perfect. the atmosphere and decor can't be beat at holiday time. in a city of drab, angular restaurant decor the warm interiors are welcome. food is respectable and at times quite good, but no more than that. if you enjoy classic, unfussy (and perhaps uninspired) american cuisine and are comfortable overpaying, you should enjoy it. the servers were welcoming and congenial and attentive without hovering and knowledge of menu items, specials, and cocktails was good. book an earlier timeslot for more relaxed service. based on a personal preference for atmosphere over michelin stars and my propensity for tartan and equestrian inspired decor it is definitely one of my favorite dining experiences in ny.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

Wow...what a treat!  This was probably one of my most memorable and favorite meals EVER in NYC. Everything was impeccable from the model wait staff to the linens to the food and crafted cocktails. Great ambiance with the signature Ralph Lauren style (leather and warm wood everywhere) that just screams class!  Oh...and did I mention the steaks were unbelievable!  We would go back over and over again!  A true gem that stands out against the countless food establishments that dot the crowded streets of Manhattan.,5,CDJD,Atlanta

Long periods of inattention from servers. We were disappointed and likely will not be back.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Generally this place is pretty good. Cool ambiance, good drinks, food portions are small (especially for the price). With the exception of the manager on duty, service was lackluster - took 20 minutes just to get water to the table.

Great atmosphere and service. Food was really good except the Brussel sprouts were a bit disappointing. Would definitely recommend this restaurant/bar for a fun date-night dinner!,5,OpenTable Diner,Charleston
"Outstanding dining experience.  Food, service and ambiance were terrific.",5,Rocket,New York Area
Was looking forward to visiting. Made an RSVP on New Years Day for 1:45 Brunch. Arrived a few minutes early and was told we would need to wait about 20 min for a table. Fine. ...the host offered us drinks from the bar as we stood at th door and apologized for the wait which we thought was really professional and courteous.....we got seated at 2:10. We thought everythinf was great until we got the bill and realized we were charged for what we assumed to be apology/complimentary drinks. Not cool.,3,NYer,New York Area

All things considered I thought Crosby bar was good- it is super cute and a nice ambiance and enjoyed the food. The waiter was not particularly attentive was the only thing- some of our party did not get their drinks before the meal etc. This was for breakfast. i would give it another try though because the food and the environment are both really good.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

"Upon entering the private gate and being greeted by name by the valet and escorted to the table we had high hopes. Unfortunately the service didn't match the first 5 minutes of arrival. It took me asking for service to get a glass of wine. The demeanor of the waiter was one of irreverence. The food was good, but soured by the service. This included having to hail the waiter for a second glass (and I'm not that impatient).  The grounds are beautiful. The main house, where the restaurant is, is great. Ask for the table by the fireplace.   Downstairs is a bar with pool, shuffleboard and fooseball. While that sounds cheesy, it fit very well and was done tastefully.   All in all we are unsure the price had equaled the service we would typically expect. It would be as easy p as smiling and asking if we have enough to drink.   100% wheelchair accessible.",3,TFGNYC,New York Area
"Winvian is hands down the best restaurant experience you will get.  From arriving at the gate, greeting by valet, the restaurant and most notably the food, it is amazing in every regard.  If you are looking to have an elegant meal at a special place look no further.   It is a little pricey but you get what you pay for.  The meal options always change and they are very diverse.  The culinary creativity is amazing.",5,MichaelM,New York Area
The evening was wonderful. Everything perfect EXCEPT the fireplace was smoking and I had to take the clothes I wore to the cleaners the next day. Regretfully I’ve had the same problem several times in different dining rooms. I would dine there far more frequently if you could solve this proble.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Wonderful dining experience in a beautiful setting.,5,DSnyc,New York Area
Winvian is rather pricey. For the $$$$ they charge for a night's stay they should include some minor amenities at no charge. That being said they do include a wonderful breakfast with your stay and their cottages are so wonderfully unique. But it may end up being a once in a lifetime experience.,5,OpenTable Diner,Miami
"An incredible dining experience from the ambience to the wonderfully prepared menu choices. The staff was top notch and    Although priced higher, you certainly leave feeling that you’ve received a great value!!",5,Gmoney,Caribbean
"Top notch! By far, the best meal I have ever experienced. Service, ambiance, food quality - all excellent!",5,OpenTable Diner,Montreal
"For most people this is a special occasion place but be warned that it will increase your desire for more special occasions.  The flavors are wonderful, the service impeccable and the ambiance perfect country. It is pricey but it is fixed price for three or four courses so there are no surprises (except maybe the charge for water).  Service is always ready when you are but never hovering. The blends of garden fresh ingredients far surpasses the ""farm to table"" craze and is masterfully done with style and perfection. There are few places in the  world that offer a more rewarding dining experience.",5,Malpractice,Chicago
We were here for a return visit. The place was very noisy due to a family reunion where there were 17 children under 13. We think we should have been given a call about this prior to arrival.  Really changed our stay. Place was not equipped to handle this,3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Unfortunately they ran out of the dessert we said we wanted, but did not order it at the time  our order was taken. It was only 8:30, but they ran out of chocolate soufflés. I would have thought they could have anticipated the demand for it.",4,ReservationQueen,New York Area

"Everything was just perfect, except the price.  It was very expensive.  The only time we would consider dining at the Winvian again is for a very special occasion.",5,OpenTable Diner,New England
"Winvian has never disappointed with the quality of the food, the ambience, or the service. The tasting menu has so many great options we couldn't choose between some of them and ended up ordering both and sharing! Summer and Fall are especially nice times to go as the majority of vegetables come from the gardens at Winvian and are so fresh - you can really taste the difference. This past meal, another guest arranged a surprise fireworks show for his wife's birthday and all the diners went outside to watch the show. It was truly special and fun! We love this spot and will come back again and again.",5,GonzoD,New York Area

"We stayed here for our 5 year anniversary.  My husband will often say that he's slightly disenchanted with the whole farm to table movement but we were both blown away by the quality of the ingredients and how they all seemed to shine in the well composed dishes.  There was nothing we would change about the meal and was everything we ever hoped farm to table would be.  Excellent, excellent experience!  Thank you for making our anniversary so special and for giving us such a spectacular meal!",5,Cgbfoodie23,New York Area
We did the Chef's Menu tonight and it was great!  All the staff were friendly from the moment we got in.  The hostess mentioned a special request I had for a table w a view and they delivered.  The food were superb.  Every dish and the wine brought to us were explained and that makes it more special.  Everyone was great and I am very appreciative for the anniversary card they all signed.  Thank you for a great experience!!  You guys are awesome and I'm recommending your restaurant to my friends,5,OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 3, 2018"
"The ambiance and service are always impeccable, but it is really the chefs who seem to outdo themselves each time we visit. We recently enjoyed a citrus tasting menu that (once again) raised the bar for winter menus and the sommelier-paired wines were simply exquisite.",5,KelF,New York Area
A unique citrus-themed dinner. The Yuzu dessert was probably my best dessert in the last 12 months.,5,Daveed,New York Area
"Overall it was a very nice experience. The food creativity is really outstanding and the staff is fully educated on all aspects of the menu.  I have to say that it was a very good. However, the price will prevent multiple revisits.   In no way am I suggesting the restaurant change. I see and understand why things are priced the way they are. With that said repeat visits will be difficult and I do not see us returning soon",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

"The restaurants atmosphere is amazing. The food was delicious, creative, and original. We ate there for Christmas Eve and thanks to the team at elements we had a awesome time so thanks again!",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"We had the tasting menu on Christmas Eve and the 5 course meal with wine pairing was selected.  Two selected the regular wine pairing, two selected the premium. Only one or two selections for each course but every one was superb. The presentations were very inventive including quail eggs presented in a ""nest"" and a menu item with a shagbark hickory reduction presented on the wood. Not even one minor complaint about any of the items from any of the diners.  Dropped a star because at the end of the evening we were astonished not to be offered a coffee , the bill was dropped on the table with a comment that the service charge was included. No inquiry if we had enjoyed the evening.  It is a very expensive restaurant with food and wine to match, the service needs to measure up to that level.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

This place is fabulous from service to restaurant design to the food.  I am really impressed that an unpretentious fine dine dinning establishment of this caliber is in tiny Princeton.  As good as any top nyc foodie restaurant and i have been to them all and many around the globe.  The $100 tag for the 5 course is a bargain by comparison to other similar quality restaurants as is the chefs tasting menu.  Blissfully happy that Elements is in my town.,5,Smorgasboard,New York Area
"Spectacular.  Of course. I'd argue it's a veritable bargain in this way: it's such an exciting cross cultural dive in a 5 senses kind of way....thus way cheaper and easier than hopping on a plane or in a car for the weekend to have a hoped for thrilling new experience.  We're sophisticated foodies, and we kept exclaiming.  For a combo Christmas/birthday gift for all 5 of them, I'll send my 21 and 27 year old sons with their 15, 18, and 25 year old cousins here for dinner without the parents.  What an unforgettable experience for them to share together.  In the end, so worth the $100-$200 a head.  At first they'll be like ""wtf?"" and by the middle of the tasting menu they will totally get it and be in thrall.  I'm sure of it.",5,OpenTable Diner,Hawaii
We were celebrating a birthday and had a wonderful night. Staff were attentive but not intrusive and food was outstanding (4 course menu). We chose the wine pairing which was an excellent add. Atmosphere was cozy and comfortable. Not inexpensive but well worth it!,5,GillC,New York Area

This was my second visit to Elements and it did not disappoint. The special event Japanese seafood tasting menu was excellent! And I loved the sparkling apple cider they current have on the menu because it is so dry and sophisticated; perfect fit for the personality of the restaurant.,5,GirlGotGlitter,Baltimore

We called to confirm if there was an Ala Carte menu and were told yes.  There wasn't.  We brought guests who were in from London and were embarrassed by the food portions and simply no menu choice.  The portions were extremely small and we all left hungry.  My wife had to give her meat portion to my son so that he ate something.  Service was good and the food was tasty but we spent a lot of money to leave hungry.,2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

All the desserts were tasty and different: the chocolate with pepper was my favorite, My husband really liked the banana bread ice cream.  Obviously, the service was memorable, they’re constantly take careful of us.",5,AJMARU,Las Vegas
Not quite worth the price point,3,OpenTable Diner,Key West
"Let’s first start with service being amazing, down to the menu being customized.  Everyone was so friendly.  The dishes were good but not amazing, maybe it was my mistake, but  at the price point it should be amazing.  However it might have been just tonight’s menu since they are changing it daily...others may have a different experience.  I just felt I’ve paid far less for a chefs tasting menu that was damn near perfect - this felt over rated and tourist trapish.",3,DoubleJ,New York Area
"the food is too salty , it doesn't worth the money at all.   compared with the other two michelin 3 stars restaurant(Le Bernardin &amp; Jean George) I've tried, Per Se has the worst food taste.  I am really disappointed. the dessert part is the worst experience ever,  it didn't look pretty, and the flavour is so strange,  i never tasted such a bad michelin dessert.  Don't we pay almost $3000 just for a 3 stars reputation?  So i will never back come and eat again.",1,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

"Per Se is excellent, top notch.  Each course is excellent, from the most creative and delicious amuse bouche I’ve ever had to the overwhelming (but delicious) array of “assorted desserts.”  Most notably, the service is absolutely impeccable—the staff caters to every need and, while very professional, do not come off as stuffy and do not take themselves or the haute dining experience you’re enjoying too seriously.  Per Se is without a doubt a once in a lifetime dining experience—unless you are fortunate enough to go there more than once.",5,OpenTableReviewer,"Dined on January 28, 2018"

"Absolutely memorable experiences.Service was outstanding, food to die for, wines off the charts amazing!",5,Smish,New York Area
"I can't overstate how tremendous of an experience this was.  The restaurant is small, only ~20 or so tables, but the space is voluminous yet quiet so you nearly feel as the experience is all your own.  The staff at every level are consummate professionals and take great care of you.  The food was elevated to an art form, in some cases literally.  We found ourselves anxious to dive in to every course, but hesitant to ruin the visual expression in front of us.  The prix fixe, nine course menu changes often, so what we had may not be relevant the next time.  That said, the black truffle tagliatelle was flawless.  After selecting the truffle from a wooden box, the server shaved so much wafer-thin goodness on top of the pasta, it was hidden entirely.  And the Wagyu filet was literally the finest preparation of meat I've ever had.  You'll leave well satisfied, but not overstuffed.  Just right.  Lastly, the wine list was extensive and impressive with a wide range of values, not surprisingly skewed heavily toward French.  Bouchon is one floor below, so grab some pastry on your way out.  Easily top 5 culinary experience of my life, and possibly #1.",5,RMellon,Seattle
"Phenomenal experience. Everyone is courteous, attentive, and ready to help. Food was delicious and beautifully presented. Don't let the small size of each plate fool you, it adds up! We were full by dessert time.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

Staff could not have been more wonderful. They have us a tour of the kitchen after our meal and the food was exceptional,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Some dishes were phenomenal while one or two fell short of expectations or appeared to be fillers in a 9 course menu.  I would have preferred fewer courses comprised of just the sensational dishes.  Even though the cost per person included the service fee it was a bit overpriced and the wine tasting was hugely over priced.  I enjoyed the one time experience but would prefer to return to places such as Grenouille and Le Bernardin.,3,Leggie73,New York Area
"I was sceptical about this place after reading the reviews, but surprisingly we enjoyed it a lot .Food was very good, ambience perfect, service good.  I visited most of michlen restaurants in Paris and I love the fact that the dishes were salted exactly like in Paris- perfect. Size of portions- excellent to enjoy and not overeat.  We plan to be back to try vegetarian menu.",5,SigG,New York Area

"This was a treasure of a find!  Exceptional food, we had steak &amp; a side salad. The salad was very creative, a land mine of wonderful flavors, and visually splendid.   The wine was delicious for a budget wine (""Educated Guess"")although they have an extensive wine list ranging from $14/glass to $2600/bottle (from what I saw, they mayhave offer more?) and the dessert really made the meal, small but Wow!  We smiled the entire time.",5,Terina,New York Area

The grounds are beautiful. The restaurant is perfect for romance. The service is attentive, but not overpowering. The food is superb. We absolutely love the Winvian.",5,drmikemaroon,New York Area
"Super fancy- like too fancy. It seemed like the other (loud, obnoxious) customers were there to prove that they could go to the fanciest spot, and weren't really appreciative of the sustainability of the food. Also, I know that the restaurant doesn't grow ALL of its own food, and I would have liked to know the other farms they work with.b",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Much better than 2 yrs ago.  Should offer a la carte selections instead of just pre fix starting at $99/person, and should not force the diner to pay a 20% tip on a $130 meal with 1 glass of wine per person",5,davids,New York Area

"Winvian is a top end, elegant restaurant in a relaxed, pleasant country atmosphere..  The menu is limited but imaginative.  Each dish is memorable.

"Had an excellent experience at Elements. This was my first time dining there. It is very different to any restaurant in New Jersey in that the kitchen is a few feet away from where your standing, they forage for their own food, and, just like at Noma or some Michelin star places, the cooks serve the dish and explain it to you instead of servers which I loved and thought it was interesting and enjoyable. Flavors compared to other restaurants were very bizarre but still excellent. Service is pretty quick and attentive since it is a very small restaurant. Atmosphere and ambiance is nice except it can get a little dark which is a con for me since I like to see and take pictures of my food. One of the best restaurants in New Jersey I have tried so far though!",5,AnthonyD,New York Area

Very unassuming  friendly restaurant with amazing food. The Maitake mushrooms were just out of this world and they had a great wine list. Even the wine by the glass was good.

"Finding your Elements Located on the 2nd floor at 66 Witherspoon Street in the heart of charming Princeton, Elements provided us with a sense of a dinner as a wondrous gathering of people, the craft of cooking, superlative flavors and tasting menus of impeccable taste and elan.  Imagine soft-boiled quail eggs wrapped in leaves which have been gently smoked. Now add a glass of Domaine Daniel Dugois, a Chardonnay from Arbois France and the food and drink wonders commence. Worth every cent from a skilled team including all the chefs who quietly bring their dish to your table. Voilá and enjoy!",5,GaltDines,New York Area
"Difficult to find and at this level of fine dining, no table cloth is quite unusual.  Our waiter did not communicate well and several pieces of information he provided were inaccurate, e.g. when I asked for the menu of the evening, he explained that menu changed on a daily basis and he wouldn't know what would  be served.  Fair enough, I then asked for the menu to be printed at the end of the evening, which he agreed.  Barely five minutes later, an exquisitely printed and beautifully illustrated menu was given to us !  Eh?  They don't talk to each other?   As for the food, we pre-booked the grand tasting menu of nearly 20 courses .  Some worked better than the others, overall it's verged too much towards experimental and quite a hit-and-miss.  At this price level, I would expect something more sure-footed.    Restaurant was very empty on a Thursday evening in downtown Princeton.  We were the last table to finish and the sous-chefs did not hesitate to change into casual clothes before we had dessert and the waiters also closed shop early.  Main chef who served us did not show a smile all evening.  He looked tired and disinterested in serving us.  Not a good sign.   I won't return and if you have not tried, don't bother",1,xuhu,New York Area
"From Hostess to Service to The Food, AMAZING! The Chefs Tasting menu was a lovely way to celebrate my husband's birthday.  Perfectly portioned to be able to enjoy each course without feeling uncomfortable afterward. The wine pairings were lovely and professionally presented. They add the gratuity for you which I appreciated, less math for me to do after enjoying my meal. The dining room is lovely, the music is kept low and unobtrusive, you can actually carry-on a conversation at your table. The open kitchen is incredibly fine tuned and Zen-like. I can't say enough good things about this experience. It's definitely in my top 5 tasting menus.",5,SeanandLauren,New York Area

"Good food, inventive menu. Attractive decor but stiff atmosphere. Server was not helpful or pleasant and, at times, verged on rude. There should be a better balance between superior food and commensurate service. Third time we have visited, consistently unimpressed by the service.",3,kris,San Francisco
"We attended the special BBQ dinner and all three of us agreed that it was among the best meals we've ever had in a Philadelphia area restaurant (none in our party reside in or near Princeton). To our surprise, the menu was actually more seafood-centric than meat driven. In fact, the only traditional BBQ'd meat was a wonderfully moist and flavorful piece of brisket. The sophistication of the menu and the artistic presentations were reminiscent of what you see in Barcelona. And at Elements, it's not just about the food. Whether you know a lot or really nothing about wine, the wine/beverage pairings offered are varied and very impressive in several contexts. Without exception, in our experience, the sommelier at Elements is the best of his profession in the Philadelphia region. Overall, Elements has evolved into one of the best restaurants in the country -- see for yourself!",5,Tucker,Philadelphia
We went there for my husbands birthday.  The food and service was outstanding.  If you are a foodie and enjoy sampling menu this is the place,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
What a fantastic experience!  The food and the wine were spectacular and the service was impeccable.   I highly recommend the chef's tasting menu.,5,OpenTable Diner,Kansas City
It’s an experience of a lifetime!,5,OpenTable Diner,Los Angeles
"Incredible restaurant and experience. Not for the financially challenged.  Getting a bottle of champagne, a bottle of white, and a bottle of red and the straight-forward fixed price menu, you can expect to pay $600 a person. It was my 50th birthday and a splurge. I will always remember the food and the bill.",5,OpenTable Diner,Miami

My husband and I have been wanting to check out Per Se for the longest time however we were both slightly underwhelmed. The food was excellent but there was not enough of it- especially for $340 a person. They fill you up with 7 different desserts at the end.,3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
It was definitely worthwhile. Flavours were unconventional without trying too hard. Great progression of tastes through the menu. The venue is definitely upmarket but service was personal and atmosphere relaxed.  Extensive wine list but some reasonable choices at the lower end.  The slow cooked beef and wagyu very different styles as expected but both excellent.  We had a really lovely night,5,OpenTable Diner,Las Vegas
"The food was excellent as always. However, there was a little less creativity and individual attention to each dish from an artistic standpoint. Half the fun of the restaurant is the presentation and the arrangements were made with a little less care and attention than previously. In addition, I would have preferred fewer dessert dishes and more attention to each plate.",4,gggg,New York Area
"We were greeted by every staff member with a warm welcome and a smile. Shown to a beautiful table over looking the park and presented a specially typed menu congratulating us on our recent engagement was a very beautiful touch.  The staff that looked after us were both very knowledgeable on all the food options and the techniques that go into making them. We chose the chefs tasting menu and we were floored with the amazing flavours, that were perfectly matched with all the components on the plate, well presented and the perfect sizing for each course. Just enough as to not fill up to early and we loved that the bread was served after a few courses so we didn't fill up on that first. The duck  was a highlight for me and well worth the supplement- I would have paid double that, my fiancé had the wagyu supplement for his main and was floored. He says the standard is set and it will take tough competition to even come close to overtaking this entire experience l.  The staff and their treatment of us literally left me with tears in my eyes and I could never recommend this place more. It was one of the most amazing experiences and I thank them so deeply for that!",5,OpenTable Diner,Sydney / NSW

Had wine pairing and was excellent. The scallop dish  with  stuffed. Holland eggplant  reminds me of Paris.  2009 Grable Vineyard Cab Sav  is to savor. Ending with Lauren-Perrier Rose’ was perfect!,5,OpenTable Diner,Portland
"I'm writing this review from heaven right now, because last night's dinner sent me there. Everything was absolutely perfect, from the service to the setting and the food. From the moment you walk through the door, everyone is extremely welcoming and kind. They were very accommodating to the person I was with, who doesn't eat seafood, and offered her different proteins for the two seafood dishes that were on the menu. I had the tasting of vegetables, which was absolutely amazing. I really recommend getting both menus so that you can share and taste every single dish - of course the menu changes daily but for us there were zero negatives. We visited for my birthday and they printed a birthday wish and my name on the menu! Afterwards the chef signed the menu and I got to take it home. We also got little stools each to put our bags on. Everything was so good - the beef was to die for, melted in your mouth and the potato agnolotti was just.. I can't even describe it. But honestly it's hard to choose a favorite when everything tastes the way it did. The desserts were amazing as well, they have different desserts for the chef's tasting and tasting of vegetables so again, recommend getting both menus if you don't mind sharing a little (or just keeping the veg option for yourself if you're not that big on meat). We were so full that we were offered to take the second round of desserts with us, which we of course did. I also got a little bag with more bonbons, caramel type things, macaroons, donuts, special Per Se birthday chocolate bars.. yes barS. Everyone was super kind and kept wishing me a happy birthday, from our server to other wait staff who changed the napkins, refilled the water, brought out the dishes and picked up the plates.. Just so many amazing things, I can go on and on and on. We don't drink alcohol so stuck to water, coke and tea, which was all free of charge. But you'll have to experience it for yourself. Go set your alarm clock and make that reservation!",5,Camomille,New York Area

"The food was extraordinary.  Thea, our server, our server was delightful and friendly.  When we arrived at 6:15, the dining room was quiet and intimate but became louder as the night went on.  The ambiance was warm and inviting.  We were celebrating our 20th anniversary and the experience was better than expected.",5,JoyB,Dined 3 days ago
"Gramercy Tavern is a must do dining experience. One of USHG’s Crown Jewels expectations were high. Generally they lived up to them. Service was a little slow to start. They took a drink order right away but it took a little to long for our server to get to us with the menus. Once he did though all was well. The pace, after the slow start, was perfect. Service was impeccable.   The food (tasting menu) ranged from excellent to transcendent, save for the dessert, which was just okay. We enjoyed both tasting menus, allowing us to sample twelve different dishes. So glad we did. Chef Anthony’s vegetable tasting menu is not to be missed. He treats vegetables as a star, not as an obligation to fill the needs of vegetarians.    About note on the dessert course. The beet sorbet, served as a prelude to the listed dessert course, was far superior to our two desserts. Mind you, they were quite delicious, but underwhelming when compared to all of the other amazing flavors we were served.  The beet sorbet and pumpkin spiced truffle saved the dessert course  All in all it was a spectacular dinner and we would, without hesitation, return.",5,OpenTable Diner,Washington DC
"My wife and I were celebrating our 2nd wedding anniversary.  We elected to have the tasting menu, and I had the wine pairing.  The food was good, but the service was lacking.  The paired wine was often poured 15+ minutes before the paired dish.  Things completely fell apart with dessert.  We waited over an hour for our dessert to show up.  When it did (poached pear with ice cream) the pear was cold.  And the table directly next to us, received their dessert before we did, even though we had been waiting longer.  Disappointing service from a restaurant known as a high-end institution in New York City.  We were offered a small discount on our check, but for a $470+ meal, I expected much better.",2,AndrewQ,Dined 4 days ago

"Gramercy Tavern was wonderful. My husband and I went there the day after my 50th birthday, we are from Northern California but love to celebrate our big milestones in NYC, and this was our first time at this restaurant. We got the prix fixe and every dish was incredible. I loved the elegant waitstaff and how discreet and non-overbearing they were, I loved the setting, and we thought each and every one of our dishes was spectacular--I had the squash salad, which was really a lobster salad with shaved brussels sprouts and a squash-based sauce, and it was heavenly, and my husband had the cavatelli which had the most amazing bolognese sauce either of us had ever tasted. And our main courses were incredible, too. Would return in a heartbeat, if we didn't live on the West Coast.",5,Minnams,San Francisco

"For a long time, Gramercy Tavern was one of my top 3 restaurants in NYC.  However, I was stunned by the price increases in the past year.  Their tasting menus offer good food but at a ridiculously high price at dinner time.  It is not worth it and I will now need to move on.",2,RaiderLady,New York Area

"What a great meal we had! We were in the dining room for lunch, but due to our time restraint we couldn’t do the tasting. The server helped us order and create a lovely meal to fit our needs and even had the grilled oyster Florentine brought over from the tavern side. Every dish was done to perfection with the best ingredients and the flavors are just right. We will remember this meal and shall return the next time we are in the city!",5,ChicagoFoodie,Chicago
"I have eaten here several times over the last 10 years and I am amazed that the experience, particularly the service, is always able to hold up to (or exceed) the last time. The staff is friendly and accommodating while still maintaining excellent table service. I had set high expectations for my friend and I think she was surprised that I was not exaggerating. They accommodated her sensitivity to red wines for our pairings with the tasting menu and knocked it out of the park for both of us (because I definitely wanted the reds!) The extra time and effort this took never came across as an inconvenience. We have both spent many years in the restaurant business and often get spoiled by friends when we dine out locally. This meal felt like we were friends with the owner and being given special treatment. The food was thoughtful, seasonally perfect, and expertly and creatively paired. Can't say enough about how much I love this NY institution. Thank you!",5,OpenTable Diner,Richmond

"Visited with my son and his two friends. Service was excellent and wine list robust. I was a little concerned going into the evening that the menu might veer towards the precious but definitively not the case here. Everything was spot on, and only as complex as absolutely necessary. No wasted thoughts or trivia for the sake of trivia here.  Nice location too, got to watch street kids in their Supreme gear go at it in the alley outside. Go, and order a nice Montrachet to start, you won't regret it.",5,HiggyHop,Nashville

"We were a family of five, my wife and I having becom 70, and our grown up children, visiting NY from Sweden, wanting a special dinner. We got it!  The tasting menu including the wine package was marvelous, indeed! We got ten delicious servings plus appetizer, each with a taste matching wine. Nothing was traditional, but it was creative and ee loved it. Also the music had great variation and creativity. We got a nice round table, the restaurant is not crowded with tables, so all the good chance for conversation and joy.  Altogether the best resaturant experience we have had.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"This was one of the most special, memorable dining experiences I have ever had. The food was delicious, with layers of flavor and combinations of ingredients were inspired; the service was friendly and perfect; the decor was industrial and chic. their attention to detail, especially if you had a food issue, which we did, was spot on. Loved the flight with the meal; it just added an additional layer to the meal.",5,hln1012,New York Area
"Honest and true flavors, mixed delicately but substantially to give a euphoric experience in one or two bites. The meal was extremely filling, almost too much to handle. But the menu was pleasantly surprising and reintroduced us to familiar flavors in a unique and thoughtful manner. The servers were patient and listened to our requests, the chefs were knowledgeable and charming. But overall this place is defined by the quality of the ingredients and the imaginative and creative way they are put together. Enjoy yourself at this, still fantastic, establishment.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I seriously missed the point of this restaurant. It's location is questionable, some strange people outside it, and inside it offers little style and class. Probably a better experience around the kitchen. The table dining is totally unsuitable for children, and the cost of the experience is quite frankly ridiculous. I can't complain about the service however, that was very good!",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"We made a reservation for the table seating because we couldn't get counter seating. Definitely ask if there are any cancellations because we got lucky and were able to sit at the counter, which is a much better experience. The tables are ok, but lack the immediacy of seeing the food being prepared just for you. I loved the presentations and all the chefs are personable and happy to talk with you about the food. The best we had were the duck, the ice cream, the uni, and the interesting presentations of the vegetables and sauces all along the way. Service was excellent and unobtrusive. I think the wine pairing prices are too high, but there are some very special wines and other alcohols served. Definitely interesting food options. Our dietary needs were catered to easily and without fuss. Hope to be able to return.",5,feltedheart,New York Area

"We went in blind and sort of missed the $195 set menu plus tax and plus service thing. It left a rather giant lump in the throat the days leading to the meal but it disappeared once we entered the door off Extra St (so extra). This place could have been the most pretentious place in Manhattan, however the staff feel relaxed, punky music plays as you sit down in the most comfortable seats known to the human behind. The chefs, all smiling before you are busy preparing you insane delights. Ko's site said 12-15 dishes, maybe we were just lucky but we got 19 dishes including a little secret something to take away. We were politely full by the end. Not too much, not too little. Go for the earliest slot possible else you might have your entire meal ruined by seeing other people's meals sitting across from you.  It was expensive as hell, but you know what, every penny was worth it.",5,Sofiii,London

I still give 5 star because of several outstanding courses.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

My girlfriend and I don't always like ""fine dining"" type experiences, but this was very low-key in that regard. Definitely not pretentious or snooty in any way. The staff was amazing. They did not hover over us, but as soon as either of us were done with our course or our drink, someone was there to take away the plate or ask if we wanted another drink. They weren't hovering but they were clearly paying very close attention.  I would highly recommend Ko.",5,bdzarvel,Philadelphia

"It was our anniversary so we treated ourselves to the drinks pairing menu, was great not to have to think about what wine to order when you don’t know the food menu ahead but the number of drinks were too many for me, especially with the smaller starter portions.

Than we got appetizers before drinks. All the drinks were a little bitter. The food was decent, nothing memorable and the service was quite slow throughout the our stay. Then we ordered a Moscato for desert and returned it because it was way too bitter (you would never expect a mocatto wine to be bitter).

"I This was my third time there and I like it a great deal. The food is very good and the decor is perfect. My favorite thing is that it's not a ""loud"" restaurant. It's classy and rightly priced for the clientele they are attracting. I will definitely be a regular.  One thing that needs a bit of improvement is the service staff. They seem slightly inexperienced. I think they could use some schooling on finding a clearer balance between being friendly and staying on task.  We sat at the bar, were given drink menues and the bartender came back to take our food order before we ordered a drink. We then got food menues and after looking at them, we had to call him over to order everything at once.  It was not a problem at all, because the food, price and atmosphere are all top shelf, but if the service was turned up a tiny notch, the 35 - 65 year olds in the hood would be coming every night.  Did I say how much I love that it's quiet? When I go out to dinner, I want to reconnect with my friends, not shout over loud music to be heard and Fred's is the perfect spot for that.   I'll b back!",4,Poor,New York Area
"This is always a five star experience.  Great staff, excellent food and a beautiful room.  A fantastic addition to Chelsea dining, and much less of a ""panic"" than the uptown version.",5,OpenTable Diner,Los Angeles

"Went for a late dinner with girl friends after theater in Chelsea. They are open until 10 PM and it was fun to be in the store after closing. It felt a little like Breakfast in Tiffany's. GREAT cocktails, snacks and pizza. Perfect.",5,LizzW,New York Area

Food was ok.  Nothing special.  Prefer Fred's of chicago.  Nicest venue and better food,3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Rude waiter. Rude manager. Food took forever to get,1,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Fish taco salad and tuna dishes were great!,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
The hostess at the front entrance was rude and dismissive. We were put at a table clearly in a high traffic area so had people walking past us during the entire lunch. Clearly this is a place where one needs to be a regular in order to count. I happen to know that I will never be a regular as I don't care for this place at all. BG's is a MUCH better option at Bergdorf Goodman.,2,AKPM,Toronto
"The food was surprisingly delicious at Fred's/Barney's downtown.  The fried zucchini chips were amazing, especially with the greek yogurt sauce.  And my tuna Nicoise was filling and well prepared.  My friend enjoyed her carrot tortellini, which I also tasted and can vouch for.  The service was friendly, relaxed and attentive - top marks there.  The space was comfortable and quiet (we got there early and it only started to fill up towards the end).  My only slight quibble is that the decor was a bit bland.  Nice mural on the wall but the colors and choice of furniture lacked interest.  All in all, though, this was a nice spot and I'd definitely go back again when I'm in the neighborhood.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The service is impeccable, the food is delicious, interesting and beautifully presented. The best Manhattan, bar none! Fred's Downtown is perfect.",5,LoveMyMom,New York Area
"Staff seemed eager to please but missed the mark at every turn. Drinks took 15-20 mins, wrong appetizer came out, entrees placed in front of wrong person.  Prices too high. Ordinary wedge salad was $24. Drinks were reasonably priced though ($16). Decor was sleek and tasteful and featured a colorful mural in the main dining area. There are other restaurants in the area which the food, service and prices are far better. It's a shame really because I've been to Fred's uptown many times for lunch and it's always been good, if a little expensive and I don't recall any issues with the service.",2,Mikehunt,New York Area

"With dated decor and hit or miss food, I would choose other NJ Italian before this. My appetizer was undercooked and incredibly salty (and I like salty food). The service was attentive. The wine list, at least the French section had numerous bottles but only 2-3 under $300! Most were $600+!",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
We enjoyed our evening at Il Capriccio. The jazz quartet added a festive touch.,4,Travelfiendnj,New York Area
"Ok-To start off with, we had not been there in 10 years but felt we should give it a try. We were not happy with our table in the back of the restaurant against a wall. We asked to be moved but they claimed there were no other tables available, which was clearly not true. Bad start. Bronzini was supposed to be prepared and plated table side-it was not. Other than those 2 negative points, the food was very good and our waiter was also attentive. Decor is a bit outdated. Definitely attracts both a monied geriatric crowd on the one end and a ""badda-bing"" crowd on the young end.",3,Backdoc,New York Area
"The food was excellent, the service was great and the overall experience was wonderful. I have driven past this place for years but I never tried it. Don't make the same mistake, bring your signficant other there tonight for a great evening! The chef greeted us upon leaving and asked about our experience. During discussion w/ him we learned his family operates a gourmet shop in Mendham called La Familia. We'll be visiting the shop soon to purchase more of the superb biscotti Il Capriccio served us after dinner.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Best Italian restaurant in NJ. Maybe the best restaurant in NJ period!,5,Best,New York Area
This is a very very nice restaurant and the food was excellent. Service was very good although I'm not sure the waiter quite grasped how we wanted our steak cooked and it came a little overdone but was not spoilt.  The only thing I would say is it's very diffuclt to have a conversation as the noise level is very high and whilst the piano music was lovely our tabel was too cloase which made it even more difficlut to talk.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Hadn't been to Il Capriccio in a few years and was pleasantly surprised at how great it was. It is still one of the prettiest rooms around. The service was elegant and leisurely. We were never rushed. The waiter was very helpful and the pianist playing was fantastic. We started by splitting the seafood salad special-light, fresh, citrusy and delicious. The special lobster pasta was tomato-y rich and really flavorful. Sheeps milk pasta was also delicious but not spectacular. Sea bass over cannelinis and broccoli was delicate and scrumptious. Veal with eggplant was surprisingly tasty with a pack of flavor at the end. Bill was not as pricey as I expected it to be. Will definitely go back.",5,pairof8s,New York Area
This was a wonderful find. We come to the area for NJ Devils games...and this was in close enough proximity. We did not know there was such a restaurant in the area. We will definitely be returning.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

"Not impressed AT ALL. Overly ornate decor inside doesnt match the quality of the food/service. There was pressure to valet during lunch which WASN't needed as they park int he same lot as self park. it isnt my fault you have too many people working there and need to gove them something to do.  it was a business lunch. The wait staff was snippy and rude. Seemed irritated about questions we had on the menu, like he would really rather be doing something else. I asked for a canolli and he flat out told me no. Lunch took 2+ hours and the food wasn't great. Seemed to be warmed over/overdone. I was dying of thirst and had to flag down someone for water tea. I was so embarassed that I recommended the place! I will NEVER go again!",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The food was phenomenal here and the service was very good. I reserved for a landmark birthday dinner for my husband and it was seemingly not noted by the staff. We were seated next to a room where a very large, loud party was being held; next to us was a radiator needing repair. When dessert was served there was no candle for my husband though when I later told my waiter he brought a second dessert with a candle. This venue has great food for a family dinner but not the attention to detail for a romantic one.",3,DMG1,New York Area

Worst experience I've ever had. We waited 1 hour to get our table. We just couldn't stand waiting anymore so we went to the front desk to tell them we were leaving. I complained that we have been waiting for an hour to the lady at the front when some guy arrived and screamed at me that I shouldn't take to her staff like that (I literally said nothing wrong but only complained which was only fair of me to do). He told me I should leave or he was going to call security. This guy was ready to call his security on a 6 months pregnant woman who just complained about her hour of wait... great way to handle a business. Will never set another foot at this place,1,OpenTable Diner,Dined 3 days ago
"I love this place. Been here 3 times already.Not only that they have great food but the service was excellent,the music is a little bit too loud by 9pm but it’s great vibe. Although the wait was long to be seated but it’s worth it. The manager is very hands on and made sure the service they provide is spot on. Yes, I do recommend this place.  Oh And don’t forget a must have: lobster Mac&amp; cheese, Parmesan truffle fries &amp; branzino",4,Kalachuchee,New York Area
"This is my 4th visit to Catch and it is becoming one of my favorites.  Took a friend there for her birthday and we had a lovely time.  Went during restaurant week - we had to ask for the special menu - but the choices were excellent.  I had the spicy shrimp appetizer, grilled salmon entrée with tamarind brown butter sauce and the sorbet for dessert. I am drooling as I write this thinking about the shrimp and salmon dishes.  Both were the perfect size, my fish was cooked perfectly and I would buy that rich, citrusy sauce by the bottle if they sold it.  Since it was a birthday celebration we also ordered the ""Hit Me"" dessert.  It was a chocolate lovers dream and the presentation is fabulous! Great food and a great time!",4,Iluvfood,New York Area
"Waited 45 minutes for our table from our reservation  time.  We got our first round of food quickly and then waited over half hour for our next round.

Second and last time there.",1,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

Went to catch for a restaurant week brunch. Food and ambiance was okay. My salmon was terribly undercooked. The top was seared but the inside was practically sushi. For a trendy seafood restaurant I was expecting a lot more. I do not plan on coming back here.,3,Foodlover,New York Area
"Before we ordered our food, we were thinking about trying something else other than the restaurant-week menu, but we didn’t. I assumed they would have chosen the best dishes on that menu. But it turned out to be a more than normal dishes-combination. The crispy shrimp had nothing special, grilled salmon was disgusting, which in turn made desserts the best dish on that day.",2,OpenTable Diner,Dined 6 days ago
"Unimaginative and disappointing menu. I was hopeful that the simple menu meant the food would be prepared extraordinarily; however, the presentation was sloppy, the MRC roll tasted fishy and mayo-ey, the Mahi was tiny and overcooked, the smores pizza was stale and room temperature and did not resemble a pizza. I literally felt sick after leaving. It felt like Applebees  hired an interior decorator and snobby hosts to try to better itself and it didn't work. Truly disappointed in this experience.",1,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

My husband and I were in Meatpacking to go to Warby Parker so I made a reservation at Catch. Glad we did. The restaurant was very crowded on a Saturday afternoon at 2:30. The food was great. We decided to do the price fixe lunch for $85.00 for 2. We shared a beet and goat cheese salad and we each had fish entrees with carrots and sorbet. All of it was very good. Let’s not forget the bottle of champagne that is included. Our waiter was wonderful and we had a great late lunch there. Will return.,4,Letseat,New York Area

"Considering it was NYC Restaurant Week I can definitely understand why it was extremely crowded and tight spaced. Idk if I will take the risk and spend top dollar for a moderate quality experience again. But to say the least, the food was great. I ordered the salmon a la plancha, which was cooked perfectly. My date ordered Mussells, again cooked and seasoned to perfection. I think our service was mediocre. My waiter forgot to ask me what type of sauce I preferred for my meal. He also didn’t take the time to go over the wine menu when I asked about the types of Chardonnay they carried, maybe he was rushed because there were so many people but he didn’t seem like he was very happy to service us. Also, the dessert choices were basic considering it is a ‘hot spot’.  Not sure if the food is worth the experience again, definitely not coming back for a traditional dinner but maybe drinks and appetizers.",3,AniW,"Dined on February 2, 2018"

"I recently visited Catch NYC during NYC Restaurant week with a reservation made through OpenTable. Upon arriving, we were instructed by a friendly greeter to take the elevator to the second floor. We checked in for our meal and were quickly dismissed. Despite the fact that it was a Monday night, the restaurant was packed, the lights were dim and the techno music was loud. We waited for about 15 minutes beyond our reservation time before being seated.  Once seated, we were dismayed to find out that the people next to us at the banquet had decided to both sit on the booth side of the table, which crowded our seating area. The waiter did not seem to care when we brought this inconvenience to his attention.   We reviewed the menus given to us but were unable to find the special restaurant week menu listed anywhere. After flipping through the menu pages a few times, the waiter came over and said, ""you must be looking for these!"" as he dangled the menus above our heads. We felt this was pretty rude as Restaurant Week is heavily advertised and we should not be made to feel we're ordering off the ""cheap"" menu.   The rest of the service was fine, as was the food. The portions seemed to be a bit smaller than what you would get if ordering off the regular menu. We started with their famous Spicy Shrimp and MRC Roll, which were great as always. For the next course we had Salmon a la Plancha which was cooked well, but incredibly small - about 4 oz - along with the Chicken Lettuce Cups, which I found to be quite overseasoned. For dessert we split the S'mores Pizza, which was fine, but nothing special and an order of cookies, which they packed up for us to go.   Overall, the experience was okay but definitely would have been better if we were in the mood to go out or see and be seen! The food and service were okay for the most part, but for the prices they charge you can certainly do better!",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

I took someone I was going on a second date with and wanted a nice quiet dimmer so we could talk and get to know one another better. All was good until around 8:00 when two large parties arrived in what was our quiet backroom. The noise level expanded exponentially and what was suppose to be an intimate dinner turned into a shouting match.  On to the food. I ordered the Boston salad with a lemon vinaigrette dressing. The salad was so salty I couldn't finish it and I happen to like my food with a fair amount of salt so it would have been impossible for someone who was on any kind of salt restricted diet. My dates Brazzini main course was delicious as was my Tagliatelle Bolognese.,4,Rv8pilot,New York Area

Went here with my girlfriend for an anniversary. Everything was quite tasty, don't get me wrong, but I didn't feel it was worth the bill I paid. I still recommend, but not an overwhelming recommendation.  Service was also lacking. Our server was very nice, but not very attentive and everything took quite a while to come out.

"One of the best Italian restaurants around, the food is fabulous and the service is impeccable... we go there about once a month, and I have never been disappointed.",5,CJMC,New York Area
"We were seated in a small room in the back with several large groups, which was fine, except LOUD! Nothing really to be done about that I guess. I just hate SHOUTING a conversation with the group I'm with. As it got later, the groups left, so it wasn't loud all night long. Other then that (and cold bread)... I really enjoyed Il Capriccio.",4,Conradb2,New York Area

"Visiting on business and didn’t want to drive into the city. Had the great fortune to find Il Capriccio on Open Table. What a treat. Ambiance was perfect with well-appointed dinning, generous table spacing, and background piano. Food was superb: Particularly enjoyed the peppercorn encrusted rack of boar.

"Great food, great service, never let us down, highly recommended",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Excellent all around. I rated a bit lower this time for servicedue to the fact that our waiter was a new one 4 weeks and has not had ample time to adjust totally to the 5 star service we have come to expect. Eye contact and freindliness was lacking to an extent.The rest of the staff, parking attendant, coat check, hostess, bartender, bus staff, are all on top of the game.",5,Logistician,New York Area
"As usual, it was an excellent evening at the restaurant. Always perfect.",5,Happy,New York Area
"Warm, and friendly atmosphere, Christmas Eve dinner was excellent, festive and the service was perfect, I enjoyed my evening very much.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
I was there this weekend (November 30-December 2). The service was awful. I was with a group that was a little louder than most but not obnoxiously so. We ran up a huge tab but the waiter expressed displeasure at every turn. I would venture to guess that my table of six spent more than any other table this past weekend and it did not seem to be appreciated. I will not return any time soon.,3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Outstanding!!! Food is incredible and the service superb. Highly Recommend this venue.,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlantic City

It was excellent . I had the filet mignon with dandelions yummy. The food was delicious and couldn't be better. So happy to have the dandelion saute. We can't wait to go again. They also surprised me and remembered it was my birthday celebration. Any other restuarant would've forgot since a week went by. Thank you for making the dinner delicious and a great time.,5,luvagoodmeal,Tampa
"Classic NJ Italian restaurant. White table clothes, table-side prep, almost an anachronism. Food was generally good to very good. Would definitely return - I felt the price point was fair for the level of food and service (Pasta's were generally in the $20 range, meat entrees were in the low-mid $30's). Nice selection of Italian wines, though a little heavier on the upper price point. The Maitre'd was helpful in selecting a mid-priced chianti ($59). Final for 3 people with starter-course, entree, wine and coffee was $200 plus tip, which I thought was fair. Nice place",4,seaskills,San Francisco
"I have been to Il Cappricio on many occasions to entertain clients. The food is excellent. They give you enough to eat for the money, and the service was understated (in a positive way). Our waiter was informative, attentive and not intrusive. I can strongly recommend Il Cappricio.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Il Capriccio continues to provide memorable and outstanding dining experiences to discerning customers. Pride is taken in every aspect of your evening here. The wine list is exceptional, with choices outstanding. You will never be disappointed when you come here for a night of gastronomical fulfillment.",5,Logistician,New York Area
"The best restaurant experience in NJ. Service is perfect, and has accomodated special requests without hesitation. menu offers great variety to please every taste and the wine list is as good as it gets. Been here several times now. I have eaten in some of the best that NY, London, Tokyo and Singapore have to offer, and this restaurant stands amongst that crowd.",5,OpenTable Diner,London
"Il Capriccio is consistant. When you want a special dinner, you can be assured you won't be disappointed. The server is knowledgeable without hovering, they let you relax but the wait between courses is appropriate. Overall an ""A+"".",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Excellent food superb service a great dining experience,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Il Capriccio was a true dining experience. You are treated like royalty, and welcomed like a member of this family-owned and operated establishment. It is a wonderful experience, especially with the live piano playing int he background. The food is authentic and done very well! You will not leave dissatisfied, nor hungry, as the food is proprtioned, delicious, and pleasing to the eyes. The staff treat you beyond well, and the way they take their time taking care of you is a rare find in today's restaurant culture.",5,OpenTable Diner,Denver
"Food, service, wine list and cocktails all top notch. Mr,Tony and his staff will treat you like a king and the kitchen will make you anything within reason. Try the Branzino to die for. We have been going to Il Capriccio for years and it is fantastic for business dinners as well as family nights. Well worth finding.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"This is a superb restaurant and I highly recommend it. The food is outstanding and the service is just right. The waiters are extremely attentive but not suffocating. The ambience is wonderful--beautiful decor, tables nicely spaced, and live piano background music. No matter what you are wearing you will fit in and be comfortable; patrons are dressed in a range of styles from suits and elegant attire to jeans. Prices are reasonable.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Food was very good, but the service was very slow and at times inattentive. the band that was playing ""dinner music"" was so loud everyone was shouting. A drum does not signal expensive, relaxed dining. Not a vert relaxing way to spend a special birthday. I have been to this resturamt before and it was a very different experience.",3,MMoon,Kent
"I found this place on Yelp! because I was meeting a client in the area. I booked her site unseen due to the reviews and for some reason I was expecting a small ""Mom &amp; Pop"" restaurant. Boy was I wrong. I was very impressed at how well appointment and classy the establishment was. The service was amazing, the menu mouth watering and the flavors very good.  I highly recommend it if you are in the area.",4,Sharkus77,New York Area
Excellent food and service- a real slice of authentic Italy here in NJ,5,Jerseybryan,Philadelphia
"This restaurant is family-owned and they use organic produce from their own farm. The deconstructed tiramisu is like nothing I have ever experienced. The food prices are worth the quality received. If I had one small observation, they do not tell you the prices of the daily specials, nor are the prices of the espresso and espresso-type drinks listed. Of course one could as the server but who wants to do this? I had just gotten back from 2 weeks in Hawaii and was use to this. Most likely, if you are eating here you are use to paying the prices charged. Experience this gem of a restaurant.",4,romanp24,New York Area

Great place for an meal and exceptional dining experience. Attentive staff and exquisite food.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Il Capriccio is a special restaurant. Quiet and dignified with great food. On the expensive side but you get great food, service and ambiance. The owners invests in the experience with a new exterior facade and a new outdoor eating area. They plan to renovate the interior as well perhaps making it a bit less stodgy. don't get me wrong, it is elegant as it is today but i suspect it will be as elegant but more modern when redone. The staff is well trained, professional and polite. We tend to go here for special occasions but have noted that it is frequented by business and neighborhood folks as well.",5,SCLC,Naples
Spectacular food and staff. Making Il Capriccio a regular spot to dine.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
The Best,5,gerardi,New York Area
"Great food great service great ambiance. The wine list even had some half bottles so you could have a glass each and not worry about driving. I ordered a veal chop medium rare and it came out a little too rare. They took it back without a hitch apologizing all the way. They returned with anew one more to my liking and it was fabulous. My wife likes her meat well done which sometimes causes a fuss. Not here, they gave her a stuffed filet with cheese that was perfect for her. Your biggest challenge will be deciding on what to eat from the choices on the menu and then of course they throw a special or two to further challenge you. Hard to see how anyone could be dissapointed here",5,OpenTable Diner,London
"Enjoyed our night out, great food, great friends, great time!",5,linag,New York Area
"Everything was great! Wonderful food, excellent service, wonderful atmosphere.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Three out of four entrees were excellent. The sole was over-cooked and over-breaded and greasy. The service is a bit self-important. We were left waiting too long to order our initial drinks, but when the waiter was ready to tell us the specials, he thought nothing of rudely interrupting our conversation rather than coming over and standing quietly for a minute to signal that he was ready to take the order. The evening clearly had to proceed on his schedule. The piano music was very nice, a bit old-fashioned but probably perfect for the crowd.",3,Portia,New York Area

"Il Capriccio never disappoints. It is a wonderful classic Italian restaurant. If you're looking for a special place to take someone, this is it! We recently went with friends who are retiring and moving away so we wanted somewhere really special. We certainly found it at Il Capriccio! The food was divine. The service was impeccable. I don't know how it could have been better. We all agreed that the cannoli's were the best we've ever had. Be warned that this is a high end restaurant and you will have a meal to remember with a bill to remember, but it is well worth the price.",5,llan658653,New York Area
"We recently celebrated our anniversary here and were quite pleased with our choice of restaurants! The service was impeccable, the wine list excellent and the cuisine five star! My husband had the New York steak which was great but I would recommend ordering it on the lesser side of the way you like it (he ordered medium rare + and it was medium.) I ordered something which was not on the menu but they were very accommodating and said they could make pretty much anything you could request! Hence, the lobster with porcini mushrooms was beyond delicious! We look forward to our next date there which will definitely be sooner than our next anniversary!",5,Jeni,New York Area
Once again Il Capriccio steps up to provide a stellar evening of grand dining. The chef knows what he is about as is exemplified by the preparation and presentation of the food. The service is excellent as always. Care is taken to see to it that your desires are met. The wines on hand are without doubt second to none and reasonably priced. You cannot go wrong dining here whether it be a special event or just a quiet dinner.,5,Logistician,New York Area

The drinks served from the bar are always made to exact specifications. In short you will leave happy and fulfilled at a memorable experience at a cost that is reasonable.

"I was famished. Couldn't wait to try this place out.. We waited for nearly 45 minutes before our order was taken. Then another 45 minutes for two salads to arrive, then another hour for dinner to arrive. I ordered a nice veal special which clearly sat under a heat lamp for most of the time. I complained, and the server did take it off the bill and offered to fire up a new dish. If I had another hour...maybe. I was somewhat embarrassed trying to find our server again because after 2 1/2 hours it was time to go home hungry.",2,Vinnie,New York Area
"Spectacular food, outstanding ""white glove"" service - a standard for other restaurants!Dom Ricci",5,zapetitie,Philadelphia
"Experienced 5 Michelin star restaurants on our trip, including Luger's, Bernardin, Madison Park, Babbo. Out of the 5, if I could only choose one for a 2nd visit, Momofuku Ko would be it. Open kitchen surrounded by counter seating for the patrons. Every one of the 14 courses was delicious, but still craving for more of the soft boiled egg potato chips with caviar. A fabulous experience in a casual, friendly atmosphere.  By the way, this place is literally in an alley. A safe alley right off a busy street, but still an alley.   I actually called before getting out of the cab to confirm we were at the right location. Upon approaching a glass door with a nondescript sign, a young lady came out from what I think is their office, and directed us to the entrance next door. It speaks volumes they can fill the place and reservations are almost impossible to get.",5,Otto,Hawaii

"the level of service is top notch! we treat our son to a dinner here when he comes to NJ for an annual business meeting. we shared a Caesar salad prepared table side and an order of tagliatelle. 2 of us chose the special osso bucco and the other the short ribs, which I thought was the hands down winner. splurged on the cannolis for dessert. everything was delicious.",5,neverhome,New York Area

"Been here in the past and was pleased. This time it was my wife and me for our first anniversary. Maybe since we were below the average age by 40 years, we were seemingly ignored when we were seated. Many hellos, excuse mes went ignored. Had to get up after 20 minutes to get the maitre d. Even then our waiter seemed rushed to go help and spend time at other tables. The food was decent however if a restaurant is going to charge New York City prices in suburban NJ it better be up to NYC quality...which it was not. Unfortunately we will probably not go back here with there being several BYOB's locally that serve as good and btter food for cheaper...and other restaurants nearby that are as expensive and live up to the price of admission.",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

It was the perfect balance of having enough staff in the restraunt so that we were never left waiting for anything and they always had an eye on the table if we needed something.

Amazing place. Authentic Lebanese cuisine.,5,Mshuayto,Detroit
"Having lived in the Middle East, we often try NY restaurants that remind us of the delicious food of our past.  Al Bustan was absolutely delicious - and authentic Lebanese cuisine.  Many families of Middle Eastern background came in while we were eating, confirming Al Bustan offers real food of the region.  While their mezzas include familiar dishes, like hummus, it is worth reaching further into Lebanese dishes.  The French beans are amazing, soft-cooked in tomatoes and onions, and spiced delicately with cinnamon and cumin - I think.  Yum.  That was followed by ground lamb in a pomegranate and tomato sauce.  Yes - fruity and tart, and unusually satisfying.  Our service was great and helpful.  We definitely recommend this restaurant.  Of note, we were there on Saturday night and discovered that there is live music starting at 10 p.m.",4,jvansch,New York Area
"wonderful, as always!!  fabulous food and service, excellent quality ingredients",5,ChrisB,New York Area
"We happened to be there on a night when they were almost empty, which permitted us and our friends to sit leisurely and comfortably for a very long time, but the food was mediocre at best, they were out of some menu items, and the whole evening had a kind of desultory air.  It could well be that they are better when they are busier, but there was nothing about the evening that would encourage us to go back - especially when there are other Lebanese restaurants in that part of town that have better food at lower prices.",3,LetsGoMets,New York Area
"Every single item we ordered  was brought out incorrectly. We would order the vegetarian version of something and the meat option was brought out, we ordered beef and they brought lamb, we ordered rice pudding and they brought vanilla pudding. The food tasted good, but it was almost comical that almost every item was incorrect.",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

"We went for Valentine's Day dinner but other than the back half of the upstairs being reserved for a private party (which was great to enjoy the music of) it was any other night at the restaurant.  The waiter and chef did a very good job catering to two vegans - of course it helps starting with a cuisine that has several options to begin with that are either vegan or easily modified to be vegan.  The atmosphere was an elegant mix of exposed brick walls but very nice decorations and color palate.

"Probably the worse food I have eaten in a NYC restaurant. Perhaps it was an off night but the $40 grilled lamb chop entree  looked like it was being served in a diner. The Cornish hen was overcooked, very dry and served with French fries?!? We have walked by this restaurant for over a year and thought we would give it a try....now I know why the restaurant is usually empty! Oh and the cost of this meal with only one glass of wine was $150!!  Do yourself a favor....walk on by....we will ,",2,Kathcg,Austin
Horrible experience with the staff. Reservation was for 9:45. Ran about 10 minutes late. Person on the phone kept saying kitchen closes at 10pm but the last reservation spot was for 10pm. Makes no sense. 4/8 of my party arrived. They would not let them order in advance,1,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

"We very much enjoyed our light lunch at Al Bustan.  There are lots of good choices for a light lunch and all is very well prepared.  Only one issue....the restaurant was almost totally empty but getting a glass of water refilled was challenging.  While the espresso was very good and I am sure the Turkish coffee is as well, it is surprising that they don't serve American coffee.",4,Cynthia,New York Area
"Authentic setting, menu/dishes. Service staff’s English is below sufficient. No uni available and do not allow take out a salmon sashimi-order for my friend, which is odd! Maybe will give the dinner menu a try",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

I am 39.5 weeks pregnant and we decided to have a nice date night out before the baby arrives. Everything was spectacular.

Very good and the food and service was excellent. Will definitely return.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The food is consistently good. The space, in a basement, is a bit grim. The front staff are unnecessarily rigid and un-accommodating. They won't seat incomplete parties even when the restaurant is half empty. They seem to go out of their way to select undesirable tables when others are available.  I've resigned myself to putting up with the schtick, but it grows old....",3,Jasper,New York Area
"Excellent service and food as always. Been eating here almost every month since discovering this place last year, and will definitely be coming back!",5,JC11,New York Area
"We had read about this restaurant in a NYC newspaper guide and it was recommend by a local as a hidden gem. It definitely is hidden well and it is a nice little place in terms of decor and ambience but the portion sizes are very very very small, hence the 'tapas' label that came with the recommendation so we went to dinner expecting smaller portions but not that small. The quality of food was good but in terms of value for money I think in NYC there must be better experiences.",2,BellaB,New York Area

This remains my go-to in NYC for sake. It's not a sushi restaurant but has outstanding warm stews and grilled items - all 100% Japanese in authenticity. But the sake is why you are there: the best of the best breweries are shown at Sakagura. Not to be missed.,5,Foodie2015,New York Area

"Fantastic experience. We ordered daikon radish salad, salmon and sea urchin sashimi, and beef on hot stone. Everything tastes fantastic. Sake was very good too.

"We reserved Sakagura for the thanks giving dinner and we sat at the bar. The food was ok but far from being the best Japanese restaurant I've been to. The dessert were nevertheless spectacular!  Service was a disappointment. The waitress seemed to be annoyed by us, she never smiled once throughout the dinner and when I asked for a suggestion for the sake, she just pored me a glass without giving any options. The restaurant has a very good reputation but I think it's now a little bit overrated since the staff seems to take it for granted.",3,OpenTable Diner,Montreal
"Very nice ambience. Good service; interesting menu and generally very good food, tho sashimi could be bettered.  Quite pricy, especially the sake",4,Dave,Washington DC
What an incredible meal! The black cod was unforgettable. Each and evry thing we ordered was memorable and brought my experience of Japanese cuisine to new levels of appreciation and sheer enjoyment. The fluke sashimi! The shredded beef back ribs!  Our server guided us through three different beautiful carafes of sake. New appreciation for all things Japanese. Will be coming back!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

Then, we were seated in the corner of the back room facing a filthy exit door, even though there were attractive tables in the front.

"I've been going to Il Capriccio since they opened in 1984. They NEVER disappoint. They are still one of the best restaurants I've ever been to. Their consistency on quality, service and attention to detail puts them in a category with a select few. Sal handles the front like an orchestra leader and is in constant motion, but never too busy to smile, stop by and chat. I live further away now, but it is more than worth the drive to go!  They are the gold standard!",5,Mg22,Atlantic City
"We had another wonderful evening at Il Capriccio. The staff is extremely professional and accommodating. For example, the Caesar salad prepared table side was a nice touch even though it wasn’t even on the menu. The steak was flavorful and cooked to perfection, better than most pretentious steak houses in the area, and the seafood pasta was incredible. Tony Grande and his staff know how to run a restaurant and we continue to look to Il Capriccio for special occasions or just a special night out. The piano player is excellent and adds to the ambiance as well.",5,njleopard,New York Area

"The price to go here is not worth it. The evening was fine. Food was good, atmosphere ok, but for the price not worth it. There are many local options that have better food, more attentive service and a more pleasant atmosphere for about the same price. We came on a night where the restaurant had two large parties that devoured the attention of the staff and made the ambiance tough. It was the not intimate special occasion (birthday) experience we envisioned. This was too bad as we had the same experience at this restaurant a few years ago and tried to give them another shot. We won't be back.",3,njmike,New York Area

"When you dine here you always have a superb dining experience. You are treated in a special manner by all of the staff, that have refined customer service to an art. The food is exquisitely prepared, and the selections available make it difficult for you to decide what you will enjoy. It takes much thought to finally select your entire meal. The wine list is extensive, and excellent. If you are unsure as to what to order, call on Salvatore for assistance, and he will guide you. I cannot recommend this place enough. The family who owns and operates the restaurant knows what it wants, and how a restaurant should be run, and it is translated into reality. I highly recommend it.",5,Logistician,New York Area

"We met our in-laws there for a belated birthday dinner for my brother-in-law,  My husband and I arrived early and had a drink at the bar.  The bartender was pleasant, apologizing for keeping us a few minutes, while he finished with another couple.  Our mixed drinks were perfect and served with a smile and friendly chatter.  The others at the bar were friendly.  We went to the table when the other couple arrived and our drinks were brought to us with grace.  Service was excellent.  The crowd is mainly middle to upper middle aged and there were LOTS of birthdays and anniversaries that night.  Lovely piano music accompanies your meal and the food is excellent.  I had the filet, which was a little undercooked for my request but, the meal was a little unique and quite tasty.  My husband and brother-in-law wanted Veal Parmesan, which was not on the menu but, the waiter had it made for them.  My sister-in-law had the salmon, which she loved and, we all brought home leftovers for lunch the next day.  I will also give special mention to the meatball appetizer which was DELICIOUS and, was separately plated so each of us got one meatball from the 2 appetizer orders.  Our waiter could not have been more pleasant nor more eager to service us impeccably.  The décor is the same as I remember from many years ago, when I was there on business.  Very classic Italian.  Nice space at your table and good space between tables.  Our second time there within a year and, we will go again.  It is not a cheap night out but, we enjoyed everything and felt it was worth the price.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

I picked this restaurant out from the NJ Top 50 restaurant list for my wife's birthday.  I put in the OpenTable reservation that it was my wife's birthday.

"Everything was pretty good except it seemed very hard to get another drink at the table after we were done with dinner. The waiter didn’t check with us for about an hour? We had another guy cleaning the table and continuously hydrating us...the water kept on coming, but not the waiter.  When we finally decided to continue our night and get drinks at another place In the area, we actually had to wave and ask someone else to get our waiter’s attention.",4,CamNY,New York Area
My wife and I had a great time at Bagatelle during Restaurant week. The server (Michael) was attentive and had personality without being obtrusive. He was terrific. There was a little mistake with our food and they were apologetic and really great about it (free Prosecco--yay!). It was a good atmosphere; food was delicious and the chocolate mousse was otherworldly--salted pecans should always accompany chocolate from hereon forward. Beautiful place as well. Wine pours were generous as well and my Bourdeaux was really nice. My wife had the Risotto and I had the Chicken. Both were excellent. Just good feelings all the way around.,5,asciglitano,New York Area

Unfortunately construction outside goes on and disrupts views. But an enjoyable meal!",3,Geordy,New York Area

"Service was great. Immediately greeted and quickly seated although we went early on a Monday (6:30pm).  Was quiet while we were there.  Decor is very schizophrenic, no cohesiveness (chandeliers and mod art).  Went during restaurant week but ended up ordering from regular menu. Butternut squash soup was good.  I liked the crusted halibut but I have had better.  The pappardelle ragout was really good, good sized for a meal.  For dessert, we had Apple Gala and Honey Bee.  Both decent but not stellar, although they were light so it ended the meal well.  Pretty good French wine menu, and also ended with Armagnac and a coffee.  Pretty good but not somewhere I would return right away.",4,Terry,Singapore

The food was not good &amp; its wayyyyyu too overpriced  Not worth it at all  I would never go back  So many other better restaurants out there,3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
My friends and I didn't have a good time. Service was bad! This restaurant should train its staff to be at the level of an A game. The staff is losing focus. They are forgetting that their fun is to see their clients having a fun. The food is just okay. Missing a wow factor. The new cheef needs to work it. I know having this venues is very demanding and this is why I'm suggesting training for the staff (every person) and better plates from the Chef.  Music was great and dessert ( thanks God) was very good.,3,NathalieT,New York Area

Too loud and food was not great,3,OpenTable Diner,Miami
The hostess was completely obnoxious - ok guessing it is because I made the reservation on Open Table. She sat us at a random table in the middle of the room - there were numerous empty booths set for 3 people (the size of our party) all around the edges of the room. We asked for a booth and she told us they were all booked. We sat there from 11:30-1:30 and all of them remained empty. Totally rude. The food was fine - I had croque monsieur that  wasn't great but fine. The restaurant setting is beautiful. The brunch gets louder as the hours go by - the waiters blast the music to turn the restaurant into a dance party. A bit of a cheesy crowd made for funny people watching.  I wouldn't go back based on the rudeness of the hostesses.,1,PreshowDinner,Baltimore

"What a disappointment. Food was good not special. Too expensive. Service is good if you are a regular, otherwise fair. Drinks were good but way too expensive. I guess casual elegance on a Saturday night means jeans and a collar less shirt. But what the heck, you are a regular. Too noisy and the piano player is overrated. Romantic as much as a chain restaurant with lower lighting levels. Unfortunately, will not return. Reviews are just wrong.",2,John77,New York Area
"Picked this restaurant based on ratings and friends referral. Food was average and I expected it to be great. My short ribs were chewy. The waiter was terrible (I think his name was Alejandro).

"My friends and I enjoyed a tasty dinner while discussing the book we just read. So many restaurants are so noisy it is difficult to enjoy a conversation. We noticed that the atmosphere was subdued, the service attentive without being intrusive, and we were not rushed. We appreciated being able to enjoy each other's company in such a lovely setting. Oh, and the food was excellent, too.",4,Kath,New York Area
"Whether a special night out or an ordinary one, Il Capriccio always comes through to provide the best of everything. Everything is honed to perfection at this family run restaurant where attention to detail is constantly supervised by all, from the owners to the busboys. All take pride in what they do and in what they provide to those who dine here, and it shows everywhere, especially in the looks of their customers... the anticipation on the faces as they enter and the satisfaction on them as they leave after another wonderful dining experience. If you have been here before, you understand, if you have not... What are you waiting for?",5,Logistician,New York Area

"We have dined here many times and it is always special. Tony, Natale, Salvatore and the staff make every effort to make your dining experience a wonderful one. Virtually all of their menu items are notable for their freshness, flavor, perfection in preparation and presentation. I think Il Capriccio's star dishes are their pastas, veal dishes and seafood dishes. They also have an extensive wine list, great bar service and a courteous, knowledgeable and attentive waitstaff. Finally, their regular pianist, Mark, has the vastest repertoire of any lounge or restaurant pianist I have ever heard. If you are a popular music lover, it is worth going there just to here him and see how many tunes you can name, although he is not there every night.",5,raygun,New York Area
Our dinner was delicious but a bit over-priced. I have had great food in other places but for half the price.,5,Andy,New York Area
My two wishes for improvement here is if the menu was a little bigger. I feel like the entree selections are a little limited. Please change your bread offering. It's served cold with frozen butter shavings (nice looking but difficult to enjoy on cold bread). The staff can't do enough for you which makes for a very pleasant experience.,4,Jay5466,New York Area
Out server Louie was a true professional! Highly recommend,5,James,New York Area
First time. Choose because of Open Table reviews and was not disappointed. Really appreciated help with menu and recommendations. Food was superb.  Will be back! Thank you for a great meal.,5,PamDiner,Western NC
Very enjoyable evening for all and our meals were exceptional!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I've been to Il Capriccio several times and each has been a great dining experience. Food is great, excellent options from the bar and an excellent wine list featuring lots of Italian wines, We had a special occasion dinner that worked perfectly, several business dinners that were all exceptional, and this is a top-shelf restaurant. We'll be back!",5,Birthdaydinner,New York Area
Excellent in all areas. Cannoli was the best. Entree and appetizer were excellent. Had a wonderful dining experience. Staff was attentive but not on top of you.,5,Nettie,New York Area
Il Capriccio is the ultimate. No better Italian cuisine experience in NJ or NYC for that matter. Consistently excellent food and service. Wine list is deep but not overwhelming.,5,Godfather4,New York Area
This my favorite elegant Italian restaurant. The food is always great and the service outstanding. Very gracious.,5,Pauline,New York Area
"When i find myself in the area for business I like to return here for my italian ""comfort food"". Home made pastas in simple sauces that let the flavor of the ingredients show. This time was a tagletelle in a simple tomato w a game-beef ragout. Very good, if a few pieces of ragout were a little fatty for my taste. Swordfish special was excellent w brocolli rabe prepared perfectly. Service is polite and attentive without being overbearing or snooty. Love returning here.",4,Davidandrose,Los Angeles
We had a thoroughly enjoyable dinner. Food and service were excellent. Look forward to returning soon,5,Fisherman,New York Area
After over 500 meals over 28 years I have never been disappointed.,5,OpenTable Diner,Miami
"Selected this restaurant for a business lunch after reading reviews online. Doesn't happen too often, but reviews were right on. Service and food were spot on, and my client thoroughly enjoyed ... extra points. I'm adding Il Capriccio to my list and will definitely be back there.",4,27East,New York Area
Exceptional quality. Treated as if we were there every night.,5,TeflonDon,New York Area
"Overall, food was terrific and cook perfectly (the steaks for all at the table were cooked exactly as requested). Price tag limits it (in my opinion) to special events or corporate dinners where companies are picking up the tab!",4,Pharma,New York Area
"Il Capriccio IS the gold standard for fine Italian dining in NJ. From the quality of the food to the excellent wine service and selection, this is always one special meal.",5,abmenu,New York Area
One of the best restaurants in Morris County,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"We had a wonderful meal at Il Capriccio. Everything from the starters to dessert was impeccably prepared and delicious, The atmosphere was a hoot, over the top ""opulent"" Italian. The people watching was equal fun to the wonderful meal. We're itching to go back on a Thursday night and probably see many of men who were with their wives and families on the weekend, dining with their girlies. Definitely worth every cent, the meal and service were all outstanding.",5,MissRed,New York Area
"Food is great, atmosphere is great, service is good, but horribly slow. This is a great place to celebrate at, just don't have anywhere else to go afterwards. We were a party of 7 and our meal lasted 3 hours. The last half hour was spent trying desperately to get our waiter's attention to get the check. Finally my husband had to get up to find him, which also took some doing....",4,bogey,Atlantic City
"My wife and I made reservations to go to Il Capriccio, Whippany, NJ. for our 2nd Anniversary (we've been together for 19 years). We went on a Tuesday night. When we got there, we were graciously greeted by the manager-host. He had our table picked out. It sat up on the second tier of the dining room. It was a nice view of the entire restaurant. The decor was beautiful. It was Old-Country Italian with wall and ceiling frescos. It was well-done and very romantic. My wife loved the place. The waiter was excellent. The food was outstanding. It was perfectly cooked. The portions were just enough. We frequent many restaurants in the area. It was an enjoyable, outstanding experience all the way around.",5,Bruceeden1,New York Area
Great experience as I brought in a group of 12 co workers after an all day Strategy Session. Reservation was ready for 7pm and we sat immediately. Wine was great as was the food. No one had a bad word. The Flying Meatballs which are trademarked were awesome. Would love to have that recipe!!,5,SuzeeQ,New York Area
"We go to Il Capriccio once or twice a month for dinner, the food and service are always excellent ...definitely one of the best Italian restaurants in the tri-state area. I've never had a meal there that wasn't excellent... highly recommend !  Sal, the manager is always very welcoming and friendly ...even after I once forgot to cancel my OpenTable reservation, oops...",5,CJMC,New York Area
"This place is seriously old-school in the best possible way. The decor is over the top, the service excellent, delivered by career waiters who take their jobs very seriously, and the food is perfectly prepared and spectacularly good. our favorites were the appetizer ""Oysters Ripiene"": stuffed with crab, spinach and pancetta and topped with a creamy brandy sauce, and for entrees, the Scrigno di Mare: lobster, jumbo scallops and Maya prawns with oyster mushrooms in ""Salsa Americana"", and the beef short ribs: slow cooked boneless grass-fed short ribs with risotto alla parmiggiana and English peas), and the signature Chilean sea bass. The true measure or a great meal: our normally boisterous crew was brought to silence!",5,SusannaFromParkton,Philadelphia
"Trendy space, good food, on the pricier end, but worth the $. Red mussels were outstanding!",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Fish focused menu with almost no meat. Server recommended sharing plates. Food was delicious - interesting and fresh. Service was excellent, especially given they've been open less than 2 weeks. Desserts were beautiful, whimsical, and yummy. However, the portions were miniscule for the price. $18 for a ""tapas"" barely enough for 5 people to just taste! We had 10 ""non-entrees"" (hot, cold, tapas) + 2 entrees + 3 side dishes. It was not enough food so we ordered 4 desserts, which were surprisingly large. With the desserts, we were no longer hungry but certainly no one was full. With tap water for all (except for 3 drinks total and no coffee), bill came to $75 pp. Not a good value for the money. I therefore (sadly) can't recommend Catch.",4,DebsDiningDestinations,New York Area
"Absolutely LOVED Catch and we had an awesome waiter to boot (Moe). Here's what we ate: oysters (super fresh), Super Crunch Rice ( a must), beet salad (if you need a bit of veggies), Hamachi tartar (yum) and Scallops (well prepared). I'm sure that this place will have a great run if the food and service stays as good as it was on their day 7.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Won't be going back in a hurry food arrived all at the same time,2,dickiea,New York Area
Unbelievable food. Excellent restaurant.,5,OpenTable Diner,Orlando
"Overall, we had a fantastic meal. great white clam flatbread!!",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"In a word the experience was terrible! After ordering, the waitstaff forgot what we ordered. They kept coming to our table with food and asking if we ordered it. They were soing the same thing to people at other tables which leads me to believe that they were either disorganized or just plain inexperienced at the job of serving. At one point a waiter spilled food on me and it stained the side of my dress. Did I mention it was also my birthday that night?? Wouldnt recommend it and wouldnt go back!",1,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Wonderful atmosphere and decor, great food and impeccable service. A seafood rest was needed and they hit it on the mark with a delicious menu of food, a wide variety of wines and great dessert !",5,EstherB,New York Area
"The food is pretty good. The location? It's in a basement, so you kinda have to deal with a humid and dark environment. It's Ok to have lunch with friends there, but not with your date.",4,Summer,Chicago
I've been to Sakagura several times and each time has been a thoroughly enjoyable evening!  The sashimi is always fresh and the sea urchin fresh - I always get the sashimi platter and seaweed salad with sesame dressing. The unisoba is very unique and a treat (sea urchin with soba). The desserts are delicious and I always find myself ordering something even though I'm not a big dessert fan generally. The venue is comfortable - you won't be out of place if you dressed up or dressed down. It's my go-to restaurant to take friends who are visiting from out of town.,5,OpenTable Diner,London
It is always wonderful place to have lunch. Remind me every time like I was in Japan. The sake selection is wonderful . Lovely place.,5,Josie,New York Area

A classy vibe with a delicious menu. Great for a date night. The speakeasy / secret restaurant vibe makes this place really special.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
A must for Japanese foodies!,5,RickZamora,México
"A touch of Tokyo in Midtown! As authentic as you can get - superb sushi beautifully presented,  extensive and impressive sake list,  exquisite daily special offerings,  to die radish salad and also seaweed salad. Don't miss the agadashi tofu - best in town. Friendly atmosphere. Don't be turned off by basement location.",5,Flash,New York Area
"Sakagura is a good standby for a quick bite or for drinks, but not a top choice for a meal. TBH, the food is three stars - the sashimi on my visits has been lackluster (although the uni is great), many of the other hot/cold dishes are often bland and one-dimensional. One more stars for their great sake list (with a very limited choice in non-sake options). Hit or miss service. Where they falter, they make up for with the atmosphere which thankfully hasn't changed much since they've gotten more and more popular.",4,AJOH,New York Area
Excellent! The food was very authentic and the ingredients were meticulously prepared and served. I would love the opportunity to come again.,4,OpenTable Diner,Cleveland
"Great izakaya style food, perfectly executed and tastes terrific. Outstanding sake list and friendly service.",5,NekoDono,Vancouver
"We've been to Sakagura many times over the years and it never disappoints. A meal there is like a trip to Japan without the jetlag.  The atmosphere is unique. The food is tasty and authentic, something like Japanese tapas. The dried sardine crackers, grilled squid, and deep fried chicken thigh marinated in sake and ginger infused soy sauce are favorites of ours. As with tapas, the cost can build up. Our waiter was patient and helpful as we tried to decide which of the many, many sakes to order. Overall, the service was friendly and charming.",4,Westsider,New York Area
The food was great. And we like the Sake very much!,5,Reviewer9379,New York Area
Always a great experience at Sakagura. Amazing sake list and the food is really tasty!,5,SandraS,New York Area
Great food...love it👌👌,5,seira,New York Area
"Went with my husband who worked in Japan for years, this restaurant reminded him of the traditional family restaurant in Japan. Great food and ambience, you can feel the respect for the food, for the customers . Not much tradition is respected the way this restaurant does, wonderful place",5,Josie,New York Area
"Location - that it's in a basement in an office building is a big wow.  Izakaya cuisine with beautiful presentation.  In fact I would recommend foregoing sushi menu to get these great izakaya dishes.  One can actually carry on a conversation there, a rarity in NYC.  FWIW the luncheon menu is totally different.  They feature more ""budget"" items for the salaryman.",5,Laurelgo,New York Area
I can't get enough of this place. Great selection for Saki and food was amazing and fresh!,5,SimpliciThi,San Diego

"We are foodies from Chicago, and had heard of Sakagura through a friend, and it was one of the best meals we've ever had.",5,AKM1,Chicago
"One of my favorite Japanese restaurants in NYC.  Excellent quality food (best uni I have ever had in US) and great selection of sake.  The setting is low key and very Japanese, even the toilet.  The service is good, but no longer feel Japanese.  My friend and I both had our umbrellas stolen there and the waitress just sent us to the building security to check the camera recording ourselves.  We were given 2 broken umbrellas that we threw them away as soon as the rain stopped.",5,lduhigashi,New York Area
Wouahhh... à faire sans hésitation... un lieu atypique ...et une cuisine tellement bonne !!!! Goûtez le Saké... ne loupez pas ce restaurant....,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The food was predictably delicious and our sake selection was superb. It was Christmas Eve and the restaurant was busy. The less than perfect part of our evening was in spite of having made a reservation a couple of weeks in advance, we were told that we'd have to have dinner at the bar because there was no table available for us. This was not the Christmas Eve experience that we had anticipated. We told the host that we would wait and we eventually did get seated at a table.",4,BP1234,Baltimore
Not much ambience in a second floor basement with stern  and cold shoulder checkin staff. The food and waitstaff compensate for this. The frilled fish roe is great..the king crab rice with butter is bland...the pork belly is succulent and the beef tongue is very tasty. The buckwheat noodle soup with uni broth is the BEST dish I have ever had!,4,Dinner,Philadelphia
We had  a wonderful time with fabulous food.  What a great place to have family get together..,5,Tigger,Orange County
The food is decent at Sakagura and you can tell it's a very popular place with all the people lined up waiting for a table but the service is terrible. We were promptly seated but had to wait 15 to 20 minutes before we were able to flag down a waiter but he deferred to another waiter and that took another 10 minutes.  We had to constantly look for somebody to ask them to refill our tea cups and then it took another 15 to 20 minutes to order additional items.  After the food came we did enjoy the food but it took another 15 minutes to find a person to take our order for dessert and probably the same or longer wait to ask for our check. There are a lot of people working but everyone was too busy to come to our table. Only go if you're not in a rush.,3,Winniefood,New York Area
This is the fourth time I've enjoyed dinner at Sakagura...The experience is almost as special as the food. A true NYC gem with authentic Japanese fare.,5,Globaldiner,New England

A visit to Japan in New York. Food was wonderful especially with sake pairing. A great find.,4,Engaged,Raleigh
Really cool place. The food was delish and really tasty!!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I have been here multiple times. Every experience is something new. Very authentic. You feel like you're in Tokyo. The place is a ""hidden"" jewel, which makes the experience even better. I highly suggest this place for either a date or out-of-towners you want to impress. The menus (sake and food) WOW!!!!! So much to choose from. I would recommend the sea urchin (cold dish) and the pork belly stew are a go-to every time. I am very confident anyone dining will be more than happy. My date LOVED it, which led to a pleasant evening ;) More sake, please! Enjoy!",5,sirnippalot,New York Area
"Excellent traditional Japanese food and service in a Tokyo-like downstairs bar/restaurant.   Exceptional selection of sakes in a variety of prices.  Wonderful for sampling ""small plates"" with many vegetable and fish offerings.",5,PAUL,New York Area
A NYC gem. I have always taken Japanese friends/associates and they enjoyed the experience as much as myself.,5,Ninjasan,New York Area
"Went there Thanksgiving night.  Service was very lacking.  The waiter seemed to be somewhere else all the time and nowhere to be found.  Food was significantly worse than previous visits... maybe the main chef was out for the holidays too?  Anyway,it was not good and I have no plans to visit any time soon.",3,Bear,New York Area

"Best uni soba in NYC! The other dishes are amazing too, totally exceeded our expectations!",5,diananyc,New York Area
"We where sitting at the bar for dinner.  Sashimi was as fresh as usual, uni soba was yummy. The best part was the sake.  The bartender has great knowledge of the sake.  He provided a lot of good suggestions. It was another enjoyable dinner at Sakagura.",5,totorotaka,Toronto
"Great! Raffinement, un délice! Grands sakés Daniel Boutaud",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Expect better service from a place as nice as Sakagura. Waitstaff seemed disinterested and we had to call them multiple times for every single thing we wanted.,4,Anuj,New York Area
Solid food and fast service during lunch time. They don't have high chairs. Menu pricing is confusing for desserts. We ordered a scoop of ice cream for which they charged us $14  because they were confused and added mochi - did not take the wrong order off the bill.,2,Mariposa,London
"The waiter kept telling us ""I think this should be enough"", ""you already ordered a lot of food, I think it's enough"", and he did it five times! We eat a lot, which I believe this should be a great thing for every restaurant! We know what we are going to order and we are aware of how many foods we can and we want to eat! DO NOT decide it for me! As to the food, fair, not special at all. The sake selection is huge, I'll give them that. Other than that, don't go there, such a waste of time and the space of my stomach.",1,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Visited Saka Gura for Valentine's Day on my first night in New York with my partner.  It is located in an office building's basement (of all places!) but when you set foot into the restaurant, you really get a great feel for it immediately.  The staff were great-- welcoming and helpful to two people inexperienced with saki. They talked to us about what options there were, helped us decide what to order, and were very personable and polite.  The food was spectacular, particularly the pork belly, black sesame dessert and the mochi.  I'm devastated I can't eat here every week! It is a spectacular treat, and I can't recommend it enough.",5,Sean,London

"Very fresh, well-prepared.  Good variety menu.  If you get there for the early sitting you can get the prix fixe lunch which is under $15.",4,Anonymous,New York Area
"My recent visit was a little on the downside. While the food is still good (not great), the service level definitely went down from my previous visit. First, they told you that you only have 2 hour for the dinner (I was the first two tables with reservation). Second, the waiter was quite cold while the service was very ""un-Japanese"".  Overall, I hope the restaurant does not get too cocky because there are many other GREAT Japanese choices in Midtown.",3,atlfoodie,Atlanta
Great food. On point service. Comfortable surroundings although it's a basement so not for the claustrophobic.,4,Droolworthy,New York Area

"Chose this restaurant on the basis of 2 excellent &amp; detailed reviews by existing customers. They were correct! The food is authentic, the waiters are polite &amp; knowledgeable &amp; the atmosphere is of a typical  Japanese restaurant  in Japan! Blackened cod was my favourite! Given the chance, we will return! We needed to order about 5 main dishes (they're small) &amp; the bill came to $200.00 for the 2 of us. Please don't be put off by the basement entrance - we had a really enjoyable evening there!",4,OpenTable Diner,London
"Sakagura is a truly authentic izakaya that is a cut above the low priced others.  It may cost a little more but the quality and variety is special.  On top of that, their sake and shochu options are second to none.  They are very serious about timeliness to reservation so don't be late.",5,dolgind,New York Area

"I popped in for a quick lunch before getting the shuttle to Newark.   I had the sake tasting menu and the $22 lunch special filled with sashimi, rice balls, grilled eel, beef and other tidbits.  It was great and if I lived in Manhattan this would be a regular haunt. The udon bowls looked great too and were very popular.   The entrance is unlikely - through an office building but cuts well decorated and serene downstairs.",5,ExSP,New York Area

One of the best Japanese restaurants I've been to,5,Hanna,Montreal
We didn't get the seating we had hoped/requested for.  As noted in the special requirements section.,3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Every time I take people there we get the best service in town. They give us plenty of time to select items and to linger over coffee. The staff never is in the way;  they seem to know what we are going to do before we do it and are ready for us. This restaurant is the best secret in Midtown,5,HappyLoneDiner,New York Area

Pre theater. Quick. No fuss. Good food. Not too expensive. Clean.,4,Freida,Indiana
"I love one sandwich and the ambience at Faces and Names, but I swear, I'm going to start ordering what I DON'T want because I think I'll have a better chance of having what I do want come out of the kitchen. This place has never, not once, not screwed up my order. This time, chose salad option instead of fries and fries came out. The wait staff is surly and they don't know their own menu. Me: no cheese on that please. Waitress: it doesn't come with chess. Me: we it say mozzarella on the menu so can you please make sure it doesn't have it. I'm not entirely sure why I keep going back. Once they do get the mushroom sandwich order right, it's really good. Super loud this time around tho. You couldn't hear anything but yelling.",2,Elfields,New York Area

"We had two vegetarians in our group. We both ordered the mushroom sandwich, which I've had before and is very good. We ordered one without cheese and one with. Waited repeated the order back to us. Both came with cheese, so we sent one back. What came back was a reuben, which made us check the other sandwich: also a reuben. Luckily, my friend hadn't bitten into it. We tried to send both back, and the waiter argued that even the mushroom sandwich has meat on it (it's not listed that way on the menu, and it doesn't come with meat). We had to argue with our waiter just to get what we ordered!! Still, I'll come back because maybe he is one bad egg. The food here is really good and fairly priced for this area. Plus, the ambiance is pretty cool. Sit by the fireplace.",3,Elfields,New York Area
"What a wonderful, fairly-priced place in Midtown. The hostess was kind enough to seat us by the fireplace even though the table was huge and we were only a party of 3. The atmosphere was comfy and casual.  My only complaint is the shrimp cocktail,  which tasted like, well, nothing. The other food was so so, except for the mushroom sandwich, which was surprisingly delightful. I'd come back.",4,Elfields,New York Area
"Not quite the dinner menu we were looking for,  cocktails, a beer was good enough.",4,Barging,New York Area

"A very disappointing experience. It took close to 90 minutes for us to our meals, even though we told our server we had theater tickets &amp; she put a ""Rush"" on our order.   When we did get our food, it was not correct &amp; one of the meals had to be sent back. When it came back, it was still not correct &amp; I told them to just take it off the bill. The other order (omelette) came with cold hash browns that couldn't be eaten.  We basically wasted 1:45 and didn't even eat.",1,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

"I've been there after a matinee and it's packed with a young-ish after-work crowd. A friend told me brunch is a great bargain so we went on Saturday before our show two blocks west.  ""Great bargain"" is the correct term. You have about eight choices for a brunch costing $12.95. And that includes a very good bloody mary, normally $10 on the bar menu. And when of the two sides is a mound of crisp bacon. Two fillings I picked for a good omelet were prosciutto and swiss cheese. Plus home fries. $12.95! Despite blaring rap music and the going-through-the-motions hostess who doubled as our waitress, I'd definitely go back for this deal.",4,Jude,Philadelphia
This was a fair place to get some and a drink a performance and priced but more...would not have dinner here as thr menu was limited. This place needs more servers....and a more menu....it was Saturday night and the poor hostess had to seat people....serve food AND drinks!,4,BECKYBROWN,New York Area
I have been to Faces and Names for lunch twice. Both times not crowded at all so you can hear the person you're with.  There is a great set up by the fireplace for group gathering. The bar is great.  I will definitely go back.,4,LidiaLipstick,New York Area
"Place is really a bar with bar food. Food was okay but nothing special. Fries a bit dry.  I had a reservation but was seated at a raised table. Hard for me because of a bad knee.  Would have expected a real table given that i had a reservation. But none were available. Only alternative was a low sofa with a ""coffee"" table.  Waitress was friendly but not overly attentive.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"VERY noisy.  We were seated in the bar area and we couldn't speak without shouting.  Maybe the back area is quieter.  We went at 7:30 pm, maybe should have gone earlier.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

Stopped in on the way back to our hotel after a show. Excellent food and service.,5,Stpete64,Tampa
"I lunch at Faces with my co workers a couple of times a month. The menu is consistently solid with typical bar food, burgers, sandwiches etc, as well as specials which are tasty and reasonably priced. I had the chicken sandwich with curly fries off the regular menu.  Foccacia bread, avocado, cheese and grilled chicken, really tasty. My co workers had the bacon burgers, black bean burger and the portabella mushroom sandwich which they enjoyed. The curly fries and onion rings are really great. The staff is friendly and attentive. Great lunch option",3,Ienjoyeatingout,New York Area

"A great lounge to enjoy your special occassion with a group or couple. Loved the portraits on the walls  &amp; was able to watch some sports on the big screen TV . Appetizers, dinner, &amp; specialty drinks were just right!",5,DoreenM,New York Area
"Nous avons très bien mangé, typiquement américain avec mini hot dogs, mini burgers, frites, petite salade. Les fenêtres qui donnent sur la rue étaient grande ouvertes permettant une bonne aération de la pièce, c'est très appréciable quand on mange. Nous recommendons vivement cette adresse à tous les touristes de passage.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
We went to Faces for Fathers Day brunch .  The menu was very limited and is probably more suited for an evening pub venture . It is in a great location and the restaurant itself is very nice and ambient.  There is great artwork of celebrity faces .  The waitress was extremely sweet and attentive.  The price was reasonable for brunch with coffee and a breakfast cocktail.  The food was ok but not something I would put on my most memorable list of have to have again.,4,WendyB,New England
"Great pub food; but the crowd was too young and noisy for us.  If you are not old fogeys like we are, I highly recommend it.",3,ihatenicknames,New York Area

I love Sakagura. Authentic Izakaya with broad sake menu and tasty dishes. Keep in mind portions are small.,5,OpenTable Diner,New England
"Fantastic food, sake, ambience!",5,DCarl1,San Francisco
"Took my mom and sister there for lunch. Mom's been craving good sushi and has been looking forward to it during her NYC visit. We ended up with a disappointing sushi dinner the night before at a different place (it was a very popular spot, too) so I was a bit nervous (because I love Sakagura and didn't want her to be disappointed again!). She was very pleased with her lunch at Sakagura. She ordered the tasting menu, I had the kaisen don, and my sister had the tuna avocado salad. My sister, a sushi snob (used to sushi in Japan), was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the tuna. Mine was solid; very fresh sashimi. The only complaints were too much salad dressing (too much wasabi, and a lot of dressing in proportion to the greens/tuna), and that there was no rice with my mom's tasting menu. It comes with homemade soba as the starch, but rice would have been a perfect complement to the beef with sauce that comes with the tasting menu.",5,MA17,New York Area
Great authentic Japanese comfort food. A bunch of selections of Sake.,4,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
Amazing meal.  Great atmosphere.  We are going back again!,5,GilSD,San Diego
"Always love making a reservation here when I'm in town. The waiter helped us select a great sake and the pacing of each plate was perfect. We were told the menu recently changed and we were a little disappointed to find that our favorite item was removed (the potato donuts!), but the food was wonderful as usual. Tried dessert for the first time and the black sesame creme brulee was amazing!!",4,Alex,New York Area
Was recommended by a close friend.  Very cool ambiance and location.  Awesome sake list and their food menu is tapas style so you can try many different items.,5,SeoulSurfer,New York Area
"Sayonara Sakegura A once unique and exciting restaurant now slipping slowly into  tired mediocrity. Only faded memories of the great cuisine of bygone days.  Certainly a step up from the ""Same old/ Same old"" standard Japanese cuisine abounding , but a considerable  loss of luster from earlier days. Jaded front desk and a general lack of enthusiasm from the staff. Seating space even more minuscule than previously and some tables postage stamp in size.  Do not even think of a bottle of sake  and a bottle of water on the table and trying to eat!!! Quality of the individual dishes inconsistent- some warm dishes cool ; others too hot to touch. sometimes plates changed sometimes not.....just depends if a person passing by and decides to clean the table. Overall: like viewing a fading movie star in the twilight of a great career...... Brillat de SavarinJnr",3,BrillatdeSavarinJnr,New York Area
"We used to live in Japan, and so are constantly on the hunt for authentic food that hasn't been Americanized. Sakagura meets that goal and then some, down to the last culinary detail. Bonus: the bathrooms even have comfy Japanese toilets with heated seats. :)",5,OpenTable Diner,Richmond
"Something was off tonight: neither when the reservation was made nor when the restaurant confirmed, did they advise there would be a ""time limit"" on our table.  Yet, when we walked in, we were immediately told we'd have to turn over the table in 90 mins. Oddly, 90 mins later, there were plenty of tables available for waiting parties - begging the question why it was necessary to say such a thing. In any event, as a result, we decided not to order a bottle of sake - what was the point if we were going to be rushed to enjoy it? Additionally, not all tables were treated equally: I noticed certain tables received tea in larger (much larger) cups than others (including ours).  On that note, portion sizes of certain dishes have been severely reduced. While I'd certainly go back - this is the only meal I've had there that wasn't top-notch - I would probably wait awhile to do so.",2,Matt,New York Area
This is a surprising and delightful place. Its location in the basement of an office building adds to the impression of unearthing a treasure. Although it is busy and lively the tables are secluded enough to give a private feeling. The menu is creative and combines ingredients in unusual ways. We enjoyed a dish of rice topped with pristine sashimi and  included a delicious bowl of cold noodles with a broth based dipping sauce. A very satisfying and remarkable lunch.,5,julietabulli,New York Area
Me and my friends enjoy this place.  The food is very good.  We actually can make make a conversation without out any interruption.,5,Lizzy,Vancouver
"A midtown gem. Hidden in the basement but worth the scavenger hunt to find it. Friendly, quick, and delicious.",5,OpenTable Diner,Washington DC
Had a girls night out here and it was a great success! There is something for every taste and sharing small plates is lots of fun! We did a Sake tasting and tries all sorts of dishes and everything was just wonderful! The wait staff was helpful in guiding us and you don't have to be Japanese to enjoy this meal!!  IF you think Japanese food is all about raw fish you will be surprised to find the great variety of possibilities beyond that!!,5,Riffeatingwell,San Diego
An amazing eclectic menu of small dishes not commonly found in other local izakayas. This is one of my favorite Japanese places in NYC. I have been going here for over 15 years and it never disappoints.,5,Hungrytiger,New York Area
"This is one of the best reasonably priced Japanese restaurants I have ever tried.  The only downside is that this place is almost always packed and it is hard to get a reservation.  Your best bet is to get there 15 to 30 minutes before they open and get one of their free tables that they set aside for walk ins.  The ambiance is great for business meals, drinks with friends or even romantic dinners.  As one can imagine from their name, they have an impressive sake collection.  But in my opinion, their food is even more impressive.  From expertly prepared sashimi to the best miso marinated cod fish in town, they offer some of the best Japanese seafood dishes around.  Lunch menu offers a variety of inexpensive tasty dishes that changes over time.  Some of my other favorites?  Ebi stick: A wonderful shrimp spring roll with an out of this world spicy and sweet dipping sauce.  Black edamame:  If you haven't tried their black edamame, you have not eaten edamame.  Just go have some.  Cold noodle with mushroom dipping sauce: Thin udon noodle of the gods with sauce from magical mushroom fairies.  Warm udon noodles with yuzu shavings:  A delicate udon dish you won't find at most Udon places.  I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.   Fried chicken:  Perfectly fried morsels of dark chicken meat goodness that is the best fried chicken dish I have ever had.  Sakagura also serves lunch on weekdays.  I actually like their lunch menu even more than their dinner menu!",5,mysecretavatar,New York Area
Good food at a reasonable price.  I recommend the Kamo Namban (duck soup).,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I really enjoyed the food, specially the great varieties of tasting sensations that seemed to explode on your tongue.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Great lunch set!,5,OpenTable Diner,Las Vegas
"This is very popular spot for excellent/authentic Japanese food, so be prepared to wait. I had booked a table, but arrived 40 mins early and asked to be seated earlier, if anything became available. I was told multiple time that this would not be possible, but yet walk-ins were told that the wait was approximately 20 minutes and were seated before us.  After ordering a fair amount of food (three dishes each person plus a bottle of sake), we were ushered out of our seating area at the back of the restaurant by the staff turning on the bright overhead lights and staff starting to sweep. My group was still chatting and sipping tea. As we exited, we saw that the front of the restaurant was still packed, and they were not closing anytime soon.   Overall: Excellent food, questionable service by snappy host/hostesses and impatient wait staff.",3,FoodLover,New York Area
Excellent food. Great sake selection. Extremely helpful waiters/waitress. This is a no brainer...a must go place if you are looking for bar food and great drinks. Been to Tokyo many times and this is as close as you can get to the real thing.,4,OpenTable Diner,Sacramento
"Sakagura is one of my favorite NYC izakayas.   It has a decent beer, spirits, and wine list.  But you come here for the sake selection!  In addition, the menu offerings are fabulous.  Agedashi tofu, buta kakuni, and the steaks on the hot stone are my favorites.  The sake master will help you pair the sake with the food.   One thing - if you blink, you will miss the entrance to Sakagura.  The restaurant is located in the basement of an office on 43rd between 2nd and 3rd aves.  Look for the sign at the entrance to the building.  Finally, the food is reasonably priced.  However, the sake could break your piggy bank.  The sake list has some high-end sake.  Itadakimasu!",5,golfandwine55,Las Vegas
"Sakagura is like stepping into a hidden world of authentic Japanese cuisine.  It is located in the basement of an office building which makes for an interesting first impression with guests as you get a ""speakeasy"" feeling.  They are always filled so it is recommended to make reservations.  The staff is very attentive and knowledgeable.  The sake collection most likely the best in the New York City and there are monthly Kuramoto nights when sake brewers from various sections of Japan come to showcase their wines - no wonder the name Sakagura translates to sake cellar.   The food is very authentic and amazing!  The sashimi is super fresh and literally melts in your mouth.  A huge variety of cooked appetizers and mains make for great dining experience to suit many palates.  Some of my favorites are the sashimi assortment, miso black cod, eggplant, beef tataki, chicken meatball, cold soba noodles, and crab rice.  There are also wonderful desserts to round out your meal including specialty puddings, ice cream, cakes and mochi.   A very strong recommendation for lunch - go early to get the daily special lunch set of various dons and soba, and for any night and special dinners.   Highly suggest trying one of the many sakes served chilled.",5,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
"Authentic Japanese ""gastropup"" in an unusual setting. Plates are small and lend themselves to sharing.  Had 7 dishes plus dessert, and it was enough food for 2 people. Every dish was a taste sensation and really hit the mark. Standouts were Ika Shiokara (you must like strong fish flavors), Onsen Tamago, Buta Kakuni, and Uni Soba. Extensive saki list. The waiter provided good recommendations that didn't break the bank. Careful though, the bill can add up quickly.",5,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco

Such a fun Izakaya! Amazing sake list and very authentic food. loved it!,5,jules,San Francisco
Excellent food and sake list!,5,JC11,New York Area
"Sakagura is a sake lover's heaven, but it also happens to serve a good range of Japanese staples, such as  sashimi, tempura, soba noodles, and various rice bowls with toppings like barbecued eel, stewed beef, chicken and eggs. The bento boxes are generous and give you an overview of the kitchen's capabilities. No sushi, for some reason, but the seasoned rice topped with sashimi is fine. The quality of the raw fish is very good, though the rice could be better. The service is efficient and the dining room lively.  The restaurant is in the basement of a building---rather steep stairs but there is an elevator.",4,ChoosyFoodie,New York Area
"On a very rare occasion, I had off from work during the workweek. I had planned on ordering  the lunch special offered on Thursday but ended up getting a late reservation bc of a friend's schedule. By the time we arrived, they were sold out of their lunch special! I was so bummed! We ended up ordering the bento and the lunch tasting course. They were both beautifully presented, and delicious, which made up for my disappointment. I love coming here.",5,MA17,New York Area
"Delicious food! We had the pork belly, sashimi, buckwheat noodles with sea urchin, and two different saki tasting flights. The mochi was fantastic. It's a magical place.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I was extremely happy to get the  heads-up about their hard-to-find location and the unpleasant basement/freight-elevator entrance. Without the OpenTable warning, it would have detracted  from the overall experience.  The entrance problems are quite puzzling since these are all solvable with some clearer signage and a coat of paint! As it turned out, the ambience of the restaurant itself and the quality of the food made up for that somewhat. The food and the service were slightly uneven, but when they were good, they were excellent.",4,woofoos,New York Area
Nice birthday dinner.,4,OpenTable Diner,Philadelphia
a really nice japanse restaurant  soba's are amazing and tasty it's worth eevry penny you are spending there  I am a great amateur of japanese food and i loved the place will go again,5,Freefrenchgirl,Miami
"This place was really cool. The sashimi was amazingly fresh. I only wished there were more pieces on the plate! The prices are not bad at all (for the area) and the location and atmosphere was very unique. It's in a basement of a high-rise, but they make it look like a traditional Japanese, outdoor café. It looks much better in person than in the pictures. I had some things I've never had before, but it seemed more traditional in taste, but modern in interpretation and presentation. I really enjoyed it. The sake is a nice addition too. Our waiter brought four different types which we rotated around the table, tasting different ones with different foods. I'll definitely have this place saved on my Google maps for next time I need a quick lunch near Grand Central!",4,TyBlack,New York Area

great place...been there for awhile but hidden gem,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"We had a party of 8 to celebrate my wife's 50th birthday.  For most of the party, it was their first time dining at Il Capriccio.  Everyone raved about the quality of the food. Each appetizer and entree was presented beautifully and everything was delicious.  Not one complaint from anyone in our party. The service was outstanding.  I want to thank the management and staff of Il Capriccio for making this a truly memorable evening.",5,springfever,New York Area

I think it is good for even business meetings.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Sakagura is one of the true gems in New York City. Aside from one of the finest, if not the finest sake list in the US (and possibly the world), the food, the ambience, the service and attention to detail is truly extraordinary. One feels so very comfortable yet on the other hand you feel very special there. Their direction in terms of food and sake guarantees a true gastronomic and sake tasting experience that I have only found equals at exclusive restaurants in Japan. For me, it is the next best thing to being in Japan and in addition it is excellent training for that next trip to Japan. The food is outstanding the servers are careful to pair the food with the sake. This is my favorite restaurant in New York City.",5,OpenTable Diner,Melbourne / VIC
"This was our second visit to Sakagura and we loved it, once again! First, the sake menu is never-ending, with everything from the very dry to the perfect sweetness. From the menu: fresh tuna sashimi and grated yam over rice served with soba is wonderful; eel topped with cucumber over rice served with soba is also excellent with perfect texture; we also love their assorted variety of oh-so-fresh sashimi! Each serving is like nothing you have ever tasted before and every ingredient is more fresh than you can imagine. Finally, end your experience with Sakagura's homemade truffles or chocolate souffle with raspberry sauce and you will have an evening that will never be forgotten.",5,OpenTable Diner,Philadelphia
So-so food -- not the best Izakaya I've been to. Veyr nice sake suggested by waitress from extensive list. And amazing desserts -- chocolate souffle and black sesame creme brulee.,4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"It is a bit pricey, but well worth the expense. It helped that this was a celebratory dinner. The waitress was great, and provided nice recommendations. The food, while I didn't have the opportunity (or the funds) to try everything, was also nice. I thought the portions were small but enough. Definitely save some room for dessert. I picked the black sesame creme brulee. Well worth the wait. I would come back again, just to sample more sake.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"We had a great time at the restaurant, we were seated right away and the service was outstanding. The food was beyond great, we had several small plates but the best of all was the sashimi with sea Urchin, this one was the third time we have tried sea urchin, but the only time we loved it. I strongly recommend Sakagura as a place to have a calm, great dinner, accompanied with a great sake.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

"A Japanese restaurant that seems truly Japanese, Sakagura has a very interesting menu made up almost entirely of small plates--most of which are not what you'd find in your neighborhood Japanese. There's also a multipage sake list and specials--my choice was described as having a scent like cotton candy. Seating is at tables and in booths that feel very private. The welcome is warm and the service helpful.  It's not surprising to find that reservations are hard to come by.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

The food was good and so was the service.  Very nice people and they were welcoming.    I was excited about how pretty the room was and their was a piano player.  Then they escorted us to the back room and I was so disappointed.  The music was piped in and I flet extremly like I was in a different restaurant.  The lighting was terrible where we could not see the menu and the room was not decorated like the front room.  I felt that only their favorite customers were put to the front.,4,Kathid23,New York Area

Although the atmosphere is beautiful at Il Capriccio and the service very good I was disappointed with the entrée dish I chose.  The waiter recommended the Spagetti and meatballs and bragioli.  My wife who is Italian and makes the most delicious meatballs asked the waiter if the meatballs were tender and light and he reassured us they were.  They were the worst meatballs we ever tasted and the beef bragioli was tough and hard to eat. This was our anniversary dinner so we were greatly disappointed.  I don't think we will be going back.,4,JohnB,New York Area

"Went to celebrate a friends birthday. Was a very special evening. The service was excellent, attentive but plenty of time .  Completely relaxed dining experience.  Food was very good.  Menu had a nice variety. A very enjoyable dining experience.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Il Capriccio is a true gem.  The food is outstanding and the service is impeccable. We went on a Tuesday this time, so there was no piano player, but it was still a truly great experience.",5,Tony,New York Area
Beautiful fancy dinner with plenty of fancy silverware. Definitely a glamorous affair with plenty of good food.,4,ajubjub,New York Area
My first time at Il Capriccio.  Heard many good things about it.  I was not disappointed.  Excellent food and service.  Great for a special night.,5,njpete,New York Area
"The wait staff was very attentive but neglected to sweep crumbs from the table.  The bread, although nicely wrapped in a napkin, was not heated.  Also disappointed to find you were out of biscotti.  I mentioned that both my husband and I were celebrating our birthdays when making our reservation, but nothing came of that.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Il Capriccio NEVER fails to please. This in a simple fact Tony benevolently oversees the establishment to ensure that the dining experience is always top of the line and never misses the mark. The food and service is excellent. The staff takes pride in their work and it shows in their demeanor. Salvatore will assist is selecting the perfect wine to accompany your meal, your taste, and your price range. This is the perfect place to celebrate a special occasion.",5,Logistician,New York Area
"The service was outstanding. My husband enjoyed his dinner  immensely. I ordered the risotto which was more like rice pilaf.  The portion sizes were very good. Evidently this is the place to go in Whippany, if one is celebrating a birthday. There were five the  evening we were there. Yes, we can recommend Il Capriccio and will probably return.",4,OpenTable Diner,Dallas
"We went for our Anniversary and what a lovely experience.  The staff was very attentive and the food was out of this world!  It was a very special night for our very special occasion.  We shared the ""flying meatballs"" and boy were they good.  This was followed by a crisp salad with walnuts and goat cheese that we loved.  For the main course, I had a pasta with shrimp and my husband had chicken with a glaze on it that melted in his mouth.  Then we just had to have dessert.  I had the tirimisu and he had coconut ice cream.  Never heard of that but it was great!",5,Specialnite,New York Area

slow service,3,Elf828,New York Area
"Although we have been to Il Capriccio many times for dinner, we've never been there for lunch.  I am pleased to report that it is every bit as wonderful a place to dine for either meal.  The service is excellent, and the changing menu always has something for every palate.  The acoustics are perfect, so, while one can hear background sounds, one can't hear conversations at other tables. The homemade pastas are exemplary, and the selection of entrees makes it difficult to choose just one.  Even the bread is difficult to resist.  A must if you haven't been, and a a place to return to if you have.  The owner has just started a take-out/catering establishment, THE FLYING MEATBALLS, about one mile east on Rte. 10.   Yummy and beyond!",5,Bruco,Richmond
"Fabulous in every way! however seating is tight, high praise to the wait staff for navigating it very nicely.",4,Igitgaloot,New York Area
Overall decent but We were a bit disappointed with the food,3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

"Hot spot for now. Drinks very expensive and bar was very crowded. Hostess was not welcoming however the server was great.  All the food we ate we enjoyed: Cripsy shrimp, calamari, spaghetti appetizer, cantonese lobster. Very noisy for my taste but when it calms down or you like a real scene check it out.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

Opentable never gave me credit for honoring my rez. but food and service was incred.,5,SmittyNice1,Washington DC
"Loved everything about this restaurant except the temperature control. Had cold air blowing on me the entire night and couldn't switch tables because they were filled to capacity. MRC roll, beet salad, crispy shrimp, crunchy rice cakes and scallop &amp; cauliflower main course were all to die for.",5,JBFS,New York Area

The service left much to be desired.,2,xxxx,New York Area
It is a hapenning place with great seafood,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
If you like the typical Meatpacking pick of the week then this is the place for you. Only downsides were the extreme noise and draft from open door outside that made our table rather an uncomfortable place to sit in winter. The food was good and the desert was even better. This pastry chef belongs at at place like Daniel or Per Se.,3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Oysters were good, as well as the catch roll",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Go here for the scene not necessarily the food or service. The restaurant is fun but extremely loud. Service was friendly however he forgot two dishes. He was not apologetic and never brought them. We enjoyed the hamachi tartar and crispy whole snapper. Beware the ""house"" chardonnay was $28 per glass.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The hostesses could be more welcoming...that was a bit of a turnoff the moment you get off the elevator. Not my first time here, so at least I expected it this time. The food is amazing. They have lots of options but everything we had was richly flavored and very fresh. I can't wait to try some of the other items, but the spaghetti with mushrooms is our absolute favorite.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"We were recommended to visit this restaurant and it was worth it, we were 2 PACx in my party we had sushi very good and a whole crispy snapper to share whit a delicious hot sauce",5,OpenTable Diner,México
"Sauteed snapper and macaroni &amp; lobster cream are the dishes not to miss. Very much a scene especially for people watching. Chef Hung Huynh the winner from Top Chef show is legit. Even though it's MPD, he makes you come back for his food and he runs his kitchen to expedite the food efficiently so turnover for tables isn't bad despite the crowd.",4,OpenTable Diner,Los Angeles
The food was excellent - enjoyed a wonderful experience.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Wine was terrible.....food average...prices high.,3,Bunny,New England
"Did not: offer to take our coats Did not: offer to carry drinks upstairs to table Did not: stop asking to clear the table before we were finished Did not: offer to refill coffee after dessert Did: over salt the Branzino Did: charge for a second cup of coffee Did: earn a poor review, a poor tip and a poor recommendation.",2,Foodlover,Miami
"Although the noise level is high and the tables small for individual couples, I would definitely return for the incredible food. The chef speciality is a Lobster Cantonese which is fantastic and nothing like one in a Chinese restaurant. The lobster mash potatoes are incredible. It's definitely a find for Shellfish lovers. There is a good assortment of seafood dishes as well as sushi. The open kitchen is interesting to watch. Not a place for people that don't like seafood even though there is steak on the menu.",4,Helenez,New York Area
"Overall had a great experience - food was awesome, ambiance energetic. Looked like there was a really great bar scene - lively but not overly crowded. Hostess was incredibly rude, didn't communicate very well - but the waitress was great and had awesome recos (she recommended the snapper and brownie cake - both were phenomenal) Brussel sprouts side was also delicious. Fried shrimp was very spicy - and a little too overpowered by the ""fried"". Lobster mac &amp; cheese was very tasty. Went with a friend, we both had a great time and would definitely go back. Am excited to try other dishes on the menu - everything sounded so great.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Great food and service, be sure to request a center table , I was cramped in on a banquets with other diners sitting right on top of us and the place was not that busy",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
New York was in need for catch. I love this place and will recommend it to the world,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Take it for what it is..a scene. Portions were small and heavily salted. Abe and Arthur's is a much better choice,2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Food was superb and tasty.....definetely a place to try...only negative aspect of the evening was that they could not honor our confirmed reservation time of 9pm. We got seated at 10pm, so we were not actually thrilled to be seated an hour later.",3,evianman,New York Area
Good Food. Good Service. Made us wait a lot even though we had a reservation. As I had taken a diplomat from Europe for dinner and making us wait looked a bad part on me. To many people talking/ quacking loudly around us. So have a mixed review about the place. Will go with friends for dinner but not take any prestige person for dinner again.,3,OpenTable Diner,New England
We arrived before the throngs of New Yorkers. The ambience on the two dining floors is vibrant and attractive. The server was eager and well informed. The suggested Crispy Shrimp appetizer was deliciously spicy. And the chef recommended inventive and tasty main courses. That said when the rush began it was Extremely Loud.,4,Likestoeat,New York Area

My first visit Saturday night - and it was great. Sat at the bar and my serve created a super 5 course tasting menu for me - every pick was ouitstanding. Can't wait to return! I am surprised there is not more buzz about this place. See you again. THX,5,Barney,New York Area

Waited 45 minutes for a table. Had to ask to be seated 3 times. Food didn't justify attitude.,2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Delicious new addition to the Meat Packing district. Trendy without being pretentious. Particularly enjoyed the stuffed calamari &amp; snapper over lobster mashed potatos. Small portions, but that's ok because then you can order more dishes to try more of the menu!",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

"The food was ridiculously late! I sat down at 10pm, and the entrees still had not arrived by 11:40pm! It ruined our New Years Eve. It was not even that packed, and the service was absolutely atrocious! The food has been wonderful the times I went before, but this was horrible. We were late meeting our friends to watch the ball drop. It was a total disaster.",1,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

"We were amazed we got a reservation as this appears to be well on its way to becoming the latest Meatpacking District hot spot. Notwithstanding this, the staff was entirely welcoming, warm, and accommodating. Our waitress, Stacy, was a gem. The menu is extensive, and lots of orders are good to share. The fish is fresh and wonderfully prepared.",4,amywestvillage,New York Area
"Just an incredible dinner highlighted by the freshest seafood I had ever tasted. Not to mention, Chef Hung was gracious enough to snap a photo with my girlfriend and I. I will not soon forget the mouth watering tuna prepared in a tamarind brown butter. Certainly, a place to be seen with food that lives totally up to the hype! Can't wait to return! Thanks for a night to remember!",5,funfoodie,New York Area
Fantastic menu and ambiance. Food is outstanding. Definitely will be back!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Delicious food. FAST service. Didn't get to meet chef Hung hyunhh =(,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Second time and loved it again. Sat at the chef's 'bar' with full view of the kitchen. Crunchy rice cake was AMAZING and the Lobster Mac &amp; Cheese was flavorful but not heavy. The crab spaghetti was tasty but a cumbersome presentation in an empty horseshoe crab shell. The Cantonese Lobster was fantastic but enough for 3-4 people! There were at least 4 monster tails and claws. Again the signature scallop dish was superbly rich, the Old Bay Fries were RIDICULOUS(!) and Chef Hung gave us a freebie--the snap peas side dish which was so fresh. Loved it and recommend highly.",5,pairof8s,New York Area
"If you like over priced, average at best food, Catch is for you. Bad service, cold food, the rush you in and out. Just like it's sister restaurant Abe &amp; Arthur's. Again, over priced, average at best food. This guy Mark Birnbaum that owns the the two places and some other night clubs is pulling a fast one on all who go to his places. Would never go back or recommend it.",1,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"My table of 6 shared alot of plates and everything we tried was good to great. Lobster cantonese, tuna on crispy rice and himachi tartar all excellent. Sides were great as was dessert. Only thing better than the food was the service. Thanks Michelle!",4,esschaer,New York Area
great place great staff nori was terrific,5,Joey,New York Area
Everyone from both hostesses to the cocktail waitress that served us our food and drinks were really rude. Had been a whole since I'd encountered the arrogant service experience. Interacting with each member of the staff was like dealing with a 1oak doorman who couldn't care less about my questions abt the menu or when I could be seated with my party.  A shame because I love the space and the food was great. The location is ideal for where I live and the ambiance was great. Unfortunately the attitude seems to be part and parcel and seems to run through the whole staff almost as though it were intentional. One saving grace was a bartender who was,3,Shola25x,New York Area
"wanted to try this place out being that it is the new ""hot spot"" but sometimes following the hype is overrated. we were charged for a second round of drinks that we ordered - but never arrived, and desserts we didn't order as well. three bus boys began setting our table for sushi - that we didn't order either. the manager offered us free desserts but the experienced was ruined and we declined. busy is one thing, neglectful is another. we were a party of 8 ready to spend a lot of time and money there and would have left a great tip if anyone had come back to our table to take more orders. despite the delicious food i won't be going back.",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Chef's Hung, Franklin and Craig are amazing! thank you once again!",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

Fabulous experience.. top notch all the way,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Food was delicious. Had an excellent Branzino on creamy bazmati, red snapper with mash and the most fabulous whole red snapper with a chili sauce on the side which was definitely enough for two people. Favorite dessert was the cookie plate - so good we ordered a second serving. Ambiance was fun. Great floor space and a nice bar area. The appetizers are on the pricey side and the best value for money was the whole red snapper. This is a restaurant we would definitely return to.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Went here before Lion King. Walked over from The Market NYC. FREEZING!!! Restaurant is upstairs and a little hard to find, but what isn't in NYC. Started with a glass of Mumm champagne which was really good. Had the crisy shrimp w/ spicy mayo and the Hellfire Roll.. smoky tuna two ways with some heat. Katie had the pan-seared Snapper w/ lobster mash and lemon butter sauce. I had sole with scallop moussiline and capers (wild mushrooms a nice surprise) Katie had Sav Blanc and I had the Viogner... the people next to us were married in Charleston and later we ran into some people from SC at The Lion King. Great time at the restaurant... saw Hung as soon as we walked to our seats. Loved the vibes and already looking forward to our next NYC trip!",4,OpenTable Diner,Washington DC
"a creative menu, food was delicious - maybe a bit over salted, only problem was the roar of the noise - you've been warned. If you like good seafood, definitely give it a try.",3,Al88,New York Area
Overall pleasant experience was overshadowed by the excessive noise level. The volume in the restaurant presumably due to low metal ceilings was so intense that the waiter could not hear our order and table conversation was a challenge.,3,Fashionfoodie,New York Area
"Splurge and order everything that catches your eye here - it's well worth it. Even something as simple as sushi, which I wouldn't necessarily order at a place like this, was incredible. We enjoyed every bite.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Great Food and a Vibrant Scene make for a wonderful evening. Rarely does a restaurant deliver like Catch. I highly recommend the experience.,5,JordanLipson,New York Area
"Very disappointed. Huge,lots of staff, very disorganized. Poor design,quite loud and it was not packed. I had to scream across the table, just 2 of us. The bar is gorgeous. The decor is very odd, like 3 people had 3 very different ideas and they all got a piece to do. I loved Chef Huang on Top Chef and I was excited in trying his first place.We had the crispy shrimp which were very  greasy and not flavorful and the crunchy rice cakes also forgettable.We had the crispy whole snapper, it was ok not really great and the asian spices were lacking.The cantonese lobster was the best thing of the night.Not great but ok.Not going back",1,OpenTable Diner,Washington DC
"A lot of restaurants in Manhattan usually miss in one area. Catch nailed them all with excellent food, attentive service, and a beautiful atmosphere in the Meatpacking District. In addition to the waitress, there were 3 others assigned to the table ensuring the water glasses were full, table cleaned, and more dishes delivered. The drinks were incredible, but also incredibly expensive (though not unusual for NYC). My favorite dish was the salmon carpaccio. It was amazingly refreshing. The banana brulee dessert was the perfect way to end dinner.",5,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
"Food and ambiance were amazing!! My husband and I received more attention from the ""clean up"" guy than we did our waitress!",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"fairly well designed space, terribly cold service which makes for a somewhat uncomfortable environment - and the food was just above average. not worth the time or money in my opinion.",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Even with a reservation, be prepared to wait 30 minutes.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Amazing atmosphere and fabulous food. Portions were perfect. You MUST save room for dessert. So unique!,4,OpenTable Diner,Cleveland
"Besides the fact that it took over 3 hours to get to our last serving of fish, the food was simply way over priced for exceptionally modest portions. Kind of how seafood might be done by the French for twice the price? Certainly not up to Milo's standards except for the price and a change of atmosphere. The manager was quite understanding of the short comings for the poor kitchen service (not the waiter) and most graciously comp'd the entire 5 person meal! Despite it all, food quality was sacrificed for atmosphere at a hefty price tag.",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"We had a family get together on March 3. Party of 12 on a busy Saturday. Everything was perfect. The food was outstanding from the beet salad, to the sushi rolls, the scallops were just so delicious. Every one was so friendly and helpful. Our server Adam was great as well as the others. We had couple of children in our party and they too had a great time and enjoyed the food. Would highly recommend and we will go back again.",5,Turnaround,New York Area
"Overall, I had a fantastic experience at Catch. The service was very good. The menu alone speaks for itself, but the waitress was very helpful with the menu and drink choices. My t able order about 4 appetizers and 2 big entree's. EAch dish was outstanding, good portion sizes and flavors. I highly recommend.",4,Drunchomania,New York Area

We were in from Boston and we know our seafood! It was absolutely great. Loved every bite . Loved the atmosphere. Loved the service. will definitely visit again next time we are in NYC !,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Food was great. Drinks delish. Service was not served with a smile. We had to ask for the yummy pretzels that each table received automatically. It was a very loud restaurant. Good for groups. When I called to see what time Catch Roof opens, the hostess told be 10pm (right after our dinner reservation) however, it really opens at 11:30pm which was a very big inconvenience for our plans for the evening.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"We sampled many different appetizers and salads etc and shared the decontructed banana split dessert, it was all delicious.",5,OpenTable Diner,New England
The restaurant was so loud I couldn't hear myself speak. The prices were too upscale for the overall dining experience.,2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I was excited to go bc I had heard a lot of great things. The crowd is terrible. Lots of bridge and tunnel folks. With that comes the loudness and the over the top attitudes. The oysters were blah, the scallops were alright, the drinks very sweet, and the service subpar. The ambience is nice, but the crowd ruined it. The best part were the truffle-fries which were amazing during the dinner. But the taste stayed with me for the whole night..",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The middle, not so good. I take some blame - I should have insisted on a different table when I was seated at a cocktail sized one. But, the woman who brought me to the table was so cold...unapproachable.  Anyway, our server started off well, bringing me a very full glass of Champagne and suggested just the right amount of food. However, when we couldnt decide between dover sole or king crab, we were assured the crab would be easy to eat at the teeny table. We opted for the crab. A few pieces were split open, we had to send it back twice to access the rest. Finally, I spoke with a manager who took care of the situation, and graciously sent over some crispy rice apps while we waited 40 minutes more. Cant recommend, however good the apps.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

"Great Food Even Better Desserts! Job Well done, Our Server Chris was Great!",5,ChefKelvin,New York Area
"We found the attitude not quite warranted proportionally to the quality of food. They made us wait even though we had a reservation. The food was expensive, and at best just ok...  More disturbing is that their elevators don't work properly...the sensors don't work well. I would not return...not worth the hooplah...",1,congogirl,New York Area
One of the best meals and service in a restauarnt that we have been to. Shocking how unbearably loud it was at 7:15 on a weekday. The loudest restaurant we have been to and the bar was impossible to get to because of the crowds and louder than a rock concert. The placed was packed but they honored our reservation on time which was shocking. We would go back but on an off time.,4,Lovetoeatout,Miami
just a great place. ABE AND ARTHURs has done it again!!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Catch overall is great place. Great for a first date or a birthday dinner. Food and Service 4 stars,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"This is such a hot spot and I was excited to get a reservation after hearing so much about it.

Awesome time! Food was tremendous and the scene was the best in NYC!,5,PhillyGuy,Philadelphia
Loved it. Had a 5:30 resi and wouldn't be seated until then...so had a great drink at the bar. We chose to sit at the 'chef's bar' overlooking the kitchen. VERY cool. Food came immediately and wait staff was terrific. Grilled calamari and shrimp dumplings were delicious and the lobster mac cheese was savory and delectable. Snapper could have been undercooked a bit more but the signature scallop dish was crazy good. Skip the banana dessert and get the cookie jar. Overall we can't wait to go back and try the crab spaghetti and one of the whole fish!,5,pairof8s,New York Area
One of the best meals I have had in New York in a long time. The lobster is AMAZING - desserts are excellent. Service is solid. Only knock is it is very loud and difficult to communicate at times.,5,Kregs525,Washington DC
"Food is Excellent, Sushi / Sushimi were great!",4,FW34,New York Area
"The GOOD: The Catch Roll (salmon &amp; crab w/ honey miso glaze) was FANTASTIC! Should've just ordered 3 rolls of this for myself. The Crispy Shrimp -- AWESOME! Spicy, tender, perfection. Could've eaten 3 orders of this also. Dungeness Crab Spaghetti -- Really good! Good hearty plate for sharing.  THE BAD: The waiter sold us on Chef Hung's Top-Chef winning entree of Scallops w/ Cauliflower puree. DO NOT GET THIS. It was $33 for the worst plate of food. I couldn't finish this...and I have never not finished a plate of scallops. The scallops tasted barely cooked w/ zero caramelization, and the sauce on top tasted like diluted peanut butter. And the cauliflower puree was like baby food with a soapy plasticky taste. AVOID THIS DISH.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The food at Catch is truly outstanding. Appetizers are creative and interesting. Fish entrees were cooked to perfection. On the downside: wine list is extremely pricy, and service overall was too intrusive (too many interruptions, clearing plates away too quickly, etc.) The restaurant is also LOUD. Don't go if you want to have a meaningful conversation.",3,agl1,New York Area
"Difficult to find the entrance and I should have taken the hint to go elsewhere. Arrived early to have a drink and wait for my table. The bar had no chairs! Ok. Another sign of things to come. I had heard of the lobster Mac-n-cheese and ordered it as an app. It was red! I dream of this dish in yellow, as in cheese. The flavor was complex, but not appealing. The snapper came next. It was a bit salty and overcooked. The mashed with it was a potato version of the previous dish. The chocolate dessert was well presented and at least washed away the taste of the two prior dishes. The wine was great. Overall, a great disappointment and overpriced at that. The Catch won't net me in again.",3,Chef611,New York Area
"pretty good food, but with too much attitude. hard to find because the small sign is unlit",3,carol,New York Area
"This was the WORST dining experience I've had in a long time. Everyone in the restaurant commeserated over the awful service, the extended delay in receiving out drinks and food. Let me break it down, we sat down at 7:30, received our drinks (after inquirig with our waiter twice) 30 mins later and our apps an hour later. After sitting four 2 hours, we received the smallest portions of lukewarm food. Luckily, the table next to us shared Hirt lobster with us so that we didn't resort to eating the table cloth during the wait. Still, they had been waiting for a couple of hours before their food arrived. It wasn't a busy night. Just awful service.",1,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The dining experience was excellent while we were at our table - the food and our server - but it could not overcome the nasty, arrogant, rudeness of everyone else we dealt with at the restaurant. We tried to make a reservation on the hour and were told it wasn't available and it had to be earlier. We showed up on time. Despite a room of empty tables, we were told they would ""find us"" in the already overcrowded bar. We asked twice how long it would be and both times were told, ""we will come find you.""",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
This is a very good seafood oriented restaurant in an area that does not have this. Catch is more about the scene though. The space is huge and it's usually crowded so reservations are highly recommended. Try to snag a table at the sushi bar on the 2nd floor. It's the perfect place for foodies because the kitchen is open.,4,JJNYC,New York Area
"Food was very good....the waiter was very attentive...BUT the hostess was extremely rude....we were late due to traffic and she said that she could not accomodate us(4 people)...the restaurant was very quiet(probably half full) and she could not explain why we couldn't be seated...we went to the oyster bar seating and asked that she grab us when she could accomondate us....we had our entire dinner at the bar, while at least 6 or 7 tables were open throughout our entire meal....poor decision to have a rude host in a brand new restaurant trying to establish themselves....",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The place is huge, there were many many open tables AND we had a reservation. Somehow still ended up waiting 15 minutes to be seated",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
The food and scene were great and I will definitely go back.,4,Sunglassesandadvil,New York Area
"We were in the hot scene as models and celebs piled in as we were leaving. Both Kris Humphries and Jonathan Cheban were in the house this evening. Food was good. Our waiter was fabulous, but we were too old to be here!",4,OpenTable Diner,Savannah
"I had been warned by other patrons that we may lose our table or get bad service but I thought our waiter did an excellent job. The somelier also made a fantastic wine recommendation as well, I was very pleased with our experience there including the bartender and hostess.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Great food and atmosphere. The only thing that was unsatifactory was the hostess. We ordered drinks at the bar and she didn't grab them when we were sitting down at the table. She also didn't pull the table out for my guest; she simply put the menu on the table and walked away. The other hostess at the entrance didn't look like she was happy to see anyone. She had the most monochromatic reaction to see anyone and she seemed tired. If the food wasnt so good I don't think I would come back.,3,RPalafox,New York Area
"Food was well cooked, just bland. For the price point, you would expect very good food and we were disappointed. We went as a group of 4 so we could try lots of different plates. We were all disappointed. If you want great seafood, you can find it elsewhere in the city. If you don't thrive in a meatpacking scene, then this is not the restaurant for you.",2,snobbyfoodie,New England
Great food and atmosphere - service was sub-par,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"FIrst let me say I rarely ever write reviews, but these types of restaurants in NYC need to reassess how they treat their repeat clientele. I live with a couple of blocks of Catch and have dined there 6 times since it's opened. However, unless you're a celebrity or ""VIP"", they treat everyone the same like just another number. EMM Group have done an awesome job of building a brand, but this is a big space and when it cools you're going to want to keep repeat customers happy. I have to say the sushi is generally very good at Catch, especially the rolls. I love the Catch, MRC and Hellfire Roll. Additionally, raw bar and most of the appetizers are quite good, the star is the crunchy rice cakes. Skip the entrees and have sushi.",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"IT seems like they put everyone against the wall that is not of importance...Big mistake, they have no idea who I am or to whom I am related. Wendy Williams was thre and she had a great table, my friend and Iwere the first ones there, the place was empty and we sat against the wall",3,OpenTable Diner,Miami
Great experience luved it for girls night!,5,Lrom,New York Area
"Food was outstanding, tons of choices will be back to check out more items. Service was great.",5,OpenTable Diner,Washington DC
Solid restaurant with a scene. Highly recommend for the food and atmosphere,5,PaulTN,New York Area
"The food here was great when they first opened, im not sure if the chef was changed or they opted for cheaper quiality food but it is not the same. The ambiance is great a lot of fun to go there for a drink or two. Id say skip the dinner its not worth the money.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Every course was better than the next - as good as the fish was as a main course - spicy tuna crispy rice appetizers and their version of apple pie dessert were the most memorable dishes.,5,Josh,Baltimore
"I have been at Catch twice and it seems the food gets better and better. It was girl's night out and we sampled an array of apps and enjoyed every single one of them, they are all stand outs. Although we had to wait 45 minutes before we sat, although we had a reservation, we were able to enjoy the bar scene and didnt realize how much time passed. You have to go here at least once, it is a very intreresting place full of beautiful interesting people.",5,gem121,New York Area
Service was excellent as was the food. I will be returning to Catch.,4,ticketytwo,New York Area
"Great scene at this meatpacking hot spot. The restaurant is filled with 'pretty' people. Buzzing bar scene as well as a hot dinner scene. Food was good, loved the lobster and the crab-meat stuffed calamari.",4,OpenTable Diner,London
While the service from check-in thru table service was excellent the food was mediocre. Both had the salmon w/horrible mashed potatoes. No veg. Good coffee. Full house @ lunch; won't go back.,2,Rhea58,New York Area
"We were a group a 13 ladies going for brunch before seeing a show. This is not my first time at Faces and I was in charge of choosing the restaurant. Everyone was pleased. The food is delicious. The prices are more than reasonable and the staff is incredibly friendly and accomadating. Honestly, I cannot say enough about the food. Everything we ordered was exceptional. It is surely a gem.",5,Cougar1,New York Area
Love the decor - the paintings of all the celebrities were a fun touch. The wait staff was very nice and attentive.,3,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
"Went after work for dinner,but this place more suitable for happy-hour/appetizers. Seating uncomfortable for dining, huge tv way too large for size of bar and back room lovely and cozy but, again, no comfortable seating. I preferred Faces &amp; Names at lunch time.",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
This is a nicely attired bar with an attractive staff. You could bring your date here or your mother. The $15 brunch which includes a cocktail is a great bargain. The food is good for bar food; it will never be confused with what they are serving next door at Gordon Ramsays. Lot's of fresh beer on tap. I would definitely go back.,3,Saxman,New York Area
It was the first time I have been to Faces and Names. I will be a return customer. The food and service was great. A great place to get together with friends after work.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Took a friend for retirement celebration, and we both enjoyed the experience/food/service/ambience at Faces &amp; Names (especially the eclectic selection of appetizers). Food was fresh and presentation was great. Will definitely return.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Brunch menu, although limited, was quite good. The food was extremely tasty, although the home fries served with my omelette were a bit on the cold side. Since we were the first customers of the day, I find that a bit unsettling.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Great looking bar spot. Great drinks and appetizers. Nice cozy booths for friends to share. Reservations for the booths are a must since the place in on the small side. Overall a cool place to visit!,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Great food and a great deal - hard to find in NYC.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The food was good, the place was nice and the service was great. Highly recommend!",5,Sanchez,Los Angeles
Perfect location for groups getting together!  A group of college buddies are planning to use this location once again for our next reunion outing.  Tasty appetizers too!,4,GTony,New York Area
We ate here with our kids after seeing the Rockettes at Radio City. We got there when the restaurant first opened and had the whole place to ourselves. It was very relaxing with a nice warm ambiance on a cold rainy day. I expect there's a whole different (fun) vibe at night. The food was very good too.,4,OpenTable Diner,Philadelphia
"A convenient, moderate priced restaurant which serves standard lunch selections near the Ziegfeld Theatre.",3,Ronalorena,New York Area
Everything was great. Nice lounge area food was good. A nice casual scene for meeting with a group of friends. The wall paintings were a great touch as well. Will be going back again!,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Music too loud for easy conversation. Really good burgers/fries. Prompt service, friendly relaxed. Pleasant (dark) atmosphere except for the music volume. Interesting caricatures. After-work crowd, not flooded by tourists.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Very kind staff, but really was not paying attention to the room at all -- presumably this lack of care is also the reason that the kitchen staff arrived an hour late, delaying food that was unremarkable at best.",1,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Perfect spot for comfort food and a drink. We enjoyed the friendly staff as we watched a playoff football game. The atmosphere was relaxed and casual. I recommend Faces and Names to anyone looking for a simple, down home, good time.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Went to theater. I learned that show let out at 1045pm. I called during intermission. Nobody answered. I left 2 VM and asked them to call to advise if they served at 11pm. After the show, I checked my VM and did not have a call from the restaurant. Tried to reach them at 1045pm and got their VM again. We chose not to walk from 48th and 8th to 54th between 7th and 6th as we were not certain that they would be open. There was no way to cancel the booking since I was out without a computer and nobody ansered their phone at 930pm! I never received a call from them prior to confirm nor did I hear from them today! of course, none of the answers mean anyting since we never did dine at Faces and Names. Thank you for your kind attention.",1,Susie,New York Area
The food here is fabulous. The menu is varied and there are always interesting specials. The level of service is what separates this restaurant from the lack of other good places. The attention to detail and the timing of every aspect of the dinner experience is perfect. We drive far to enjoy this and it is worth it!,5,neverhome,New York Area
"We had a 5:30 reservation and were literally the first ones there.  Our waiter was extremely friendly and attentive for the first part of the meal but once it got busy, we waited quite  a long time for the bill to arrive.",4,Firsttimers,New York Area
Not a sushi place but interesting delicous Japenes cuisine.,4,NewYorkNancy,New York Area
"Food, service and wine selection all of the charts. Had the buffalo mozzarella with tomatoes as an appetizer. Best mozzarella I have eaten. Very creamy and flavorful. My colleague had the meatballs which she said were to die for. Main courses were also perfect. I had the cittaro botargo, a little of grid but I will have again it was that good.",5,RicknJan,Pittsburgh
Great Italian food and world class service.  I always dine here when i am in New Jersey and the never disappoint!,5,OpenTable Diner,Savannah
"The meal was amazing!  They accomodated 17 of us in our own room.  The house wine was superb.  Our meals ranged from fish to pasta to veal - and everything was fantastic!  The standout (the one food item we kept talking about all weekend) was the stuffed artichoke appetizer - the flavor was unparalleled.  We were only visiting for the weekend, but we will return when we are back in NJ!",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Excellent Resturant to mark a celebration or milestone. Piano player is excellent, service is attentive and food is extraordinary.  Will not disappoint.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

"Celebrated my birthday with our family of four.  We have dined at Il Capriccio a number of times but this was the first time with our two teenage daughters.  As always, the food was first class.  The menu has something for everyone. Service is attentive but not distracting and you are never rushed.  It's pricey, but worth it. We enjoy celebrating special occasions at Il Capriccio and we will definitely be back.",5,springfever,New York Area

Overall great experience  We would definately return,4,njdevs,New England
"I wasn't a huge fan of my Filet Mignon, but I LOVED my partner's shrimp and scallops. Sadly, we missed the piano player (he didn't start until 7:30pm). It was a nice, welcoming environment.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"We went to Il Capriccio midweek and had a great time.  The food was fabulous and the service was personal when necessary, but not hovering.  This is definitely a 'special evening out' kind of a place for us, and we plan to go again in the next month or two.",5,HelenJeanne,New York Area
"We don't live that close to Il Capriccio but if we did we would definitely visit more often. The food is exceptional, service outstanding and such a lovely ambiance. Love the piano player too. All the waiters are extremely friendly. They don't rush you and you feel very welcome! I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone. Top notch in my book!",5,Darsey,New York Area
"The perfect place to celebrate a quiet birthday.  It was over the top delicious, the ambiance divine, the service suburb, and the wine was sublime.  We highly recommend this restaurant because everything on the menu is always good.  We will be back again and again.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"From the beginning to end a perfect dining experience. The service and food is always beyond expectation. We like to think of  this as a special place but then again, Wednesday can be pretty special too!",5,Betty,New York Area
"Great food, great decor, great service. Highly recommend.",5,Casm,New York Area
Il Capriccio is a wonderful restaurant. The service is impeccable. The food is excellent and the atmosphere is relaxed and enjoyable. We recently re-discovered this restaurant and have had several fine dining experiences. Great for special occasions or a quiet night out.,5,JCH104,New York Area
"My husband and I are seafood lovers.  We were not disappointed.  I had seared peppercorn crusted tuna (rare), and my husband had a swordfish special.  The service was friendly and attentive. The atmosphere was very festive for the holidays, and the pianist enjoyable.  The restaurant was quite full, but the tables are spaced nicely and we were able to enjoy our conversation.",5,Seafood,New York Area

We had a small team dinner in Il Capriccio and enjoyed food and ambience.  There is plenty of well trained wait staff around who are extremely polite and attentive.  The food was great - looks and taste were excellent. Will go there again when in town.,5,gemseeker,Houston
"The food and service were excellent.  But, to be charged $10.00 for a bottle of sparkling water was a bit pricey.  I know for a fact that the bottle we ordered cost the restaurant no more then $2.00.",4,KKM1,New York Area
Always a great experience.  I take my professional associates here for dinner and we're never disappointed.  Many of my guests are from Europe and this place always impresses.  Food is top notch and the wine list is awesome and service is exceptional.  Those Europeans are  impressed.   Next!!!!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Pleasant surrounding,including flowers and pianist. Excellent gracious service. Large  selection of items. All foods were very tasty and nicely presented. A really fine evening.",4,borntodine,New York Area
"We went there to have an anniversary and birthday dinner; and although I had been there before and enjoyed it, I was very disappointed!  I made the reservation a month in advance.  When confirmed I requested a round table in the main dining room.  We arrived early and thought we could sit at the bar.  The bar is so small and there is not enough space to stand.  Finally, we were brought to our table which was reserved in the back!  I told them I did not want to sit back there that I wanted the main dining room.  Anyway, in the back there was a large group/party.  There was no room in the main dining room - I am assuming they keep that for their preferred clients... We ordered and shortly after requesting more water an entire glass of ice water is spilled all over one in our party!  All they did was change her chair!  We had to request that they put dry napkins on the table in from of her.  Also, they never offered to have the dress dry-cleaned.  Who knows if the dress will have water stains on it!  I have no complaints about the food - it was very good.  The service and the decor need to be addressed.  The place really needs a facelift.",2,dmarie,New York Area
"Wonderful food, great service, beautiful, fine dining at it's best.",5,Caralina,New York Area
Il Capriccio lives up to our expectations each and every time with regard to food service and ambience. The satisfaction is the reason that we return time after time for special occasions. Everyone there makes each occasion truly special. you will never regret your choice by coming here.,5,Logistician,New York Area
"This place is great for business dinners with wonderfully prepared and consistent Italian dinner selections, an excellent wine list and well trained service.  Groups from 2 to 8 can talk easily and valet parking is readily available for bad weather.  We'll definitely return.",4,LawyerPOV,New England
It is a very cheesy atmosphere,5,Jytf,New England
Very good food.  Try the meatballs! My group of 5 enjoyed everything  on the menu.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Enjoyed our anniversary dinner  at Il Capriccio on Saturday!! Dinner was very good. Menu is nice and has good selections. I would go there for special events. Not really your Friday night ""run out for dinner"" joint! But if you're celebrating, it's worth the money!",5,CS22,Atlantic City
"My husband and I dined at Il Capriccio once before and loved it so we hosted a party of 7--5 adults and 2 children (4 1/2 yr old and 19 mo. old) to celebrate my in-laws' 45th wedding anniversary at 5:30pm on a Saturday night. We booked the reservation early since we were dining with our kids didn't want to intrude on others' date nights later in the evening.  Our server was wonderful, catering to our every need.  He even went to taste the sausage in the sausage and broccoli rabe special to let me know how spicy it was!  He was also very accomodating to our children, which is always appreciated.  The restaurant is fairly large but they seated us with several other parties in one of the dining rooms which was fine until about halfway through our meal when the hostess abruptly approached the patrons surrounding our table to ask at a very audible volume if our children were bothering them.  We were particularly annoyed considering we were a large party who was running a large tab AND there was an entire empty dining room where they could've either seated us by ourselves or other patrons if they were concerned our children would interrupt others' dining experiences.  No one had even expressed frustration with our boys' behavior so the hostess' actions were completely unwarranted.  We didn't let it ruin our night, however, and everyone absolutely loved their entrees.  Our waiter even split an order of spaghetti and meatballs for our little guys. We did mention something to the hostess on our way out to let her know we overheard her asking the other patrons about our boys and my husband said if it weren't for the quality service we received and the delicious food we ate that night, we probably wouldn't come back.  That being said, the food is excellent and the wine list is outstanding.  We all had a wonderful celebration and were raving about our meals days later.  Thank you Il Capriccio, we will be back!",5,FoodforThought,New York Area
I have frequented Il Capriccio many times and have never been disappointed. Exceptional food and service always make for a wonderful experience....,5,Azzurri,New York Area
"My wife and I celebrated our anniversary at the restaurant.  The food was very good.  But, the service was less than desirable.  A group was seated and it was obvious they were ""special"".  All of the waiters attended to them.  The chef came out seven times (passing our table) to ask what they wanted.  Never did he or the waiters acknowledge us for the rest of our dining experience!  It was very disappointing to be treated so poorly.  It must be great to be ""special""!  Needless to say, we will not allow ourselves to be treated so poorly again at this restaurant.",3,SalB,New York Area
"When dining with a group, you hope for positive consensus.  It doesn't always happen. People should know that if they are unhappy with their meal, the service or anything at a restaurant like il capricio,  they will do their utmost to correct.",3,Tryagain,New York Area
"We have been going to Il Capriccio for years for special occasions.  It has maintained its outstanding character, ambiance and food.   It is a wonder that such a place could exists for all this time, but it has.  We highly recommend it to anyone who wants a special meal for a special occasion.   Even when they are extremely busy, they continue to impress with outstanding service.",5,Tony,New York Area
"Our family dined here for the first time on Sat. We found it to be an upscale, elegant restaurant yet, the entire staff made us feel comfortable and welcome.  Three of us had the veal special and we all loved it! Portions are perfectly sized and beautifully plated. We thought the wait staff was very attentive and the live piano player added to the ambience.  Had the chocolate lava cake for dessert; it was out of this world!! We will definitely be back with more friends and family.",5,paradise,New York Area
Have lived in the area for 16 years and always meant to come here - dont know why it took me so long! Service was A+ from the moment the valet driver greeted me and opened my door with a smile. Dennis was excellent as our server - food was outstanding.  Will most definitely be back.,5,supereen,New York Area
Celebrated a 60th bday.  Fig appetizer was so delicious.  Our entrees Consisted of the veal chop and Chilean sea bass with a lovely bottle of wine.  Everything was cooked to perfection.  Dessert was the warm apple crumb cake.  Staff was knowledgable and provided excellent service.  Thoroughly enjoyable evening!!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
We were disappointed this time around. The food was just not as good as I remember when we came at lunch. Great sake but the food is not that good.,2,HasshuSan,Los Angeles
Wonderful gem and sake treasure chest,5,OpenTable Diner,Los Angeles
"We had a lunch reservation. They called me ONE HOUR before and told me to ""be on time"" or they'll cancel the reservation. I live near by, but many people would have been already in a car or subway not be able to pick up the call. The food was good, but I'm not sure if it was good enough to put up with their attitude.",3,NYOrangecat,New York Area
A nice evening with excellent food to go with the sake. But ! be careful the sake can cost a bundle and the barkeep steers you to the expensive stuff.,4,OpenTable Diner,New England
Tucked away in the basement of this address is a wonderful authentic Japanese restaurant. We've been going to NYC at least once every year for the last 20 years and we always book reservations through Open Table. Sakagura must be a recent subscriber - since it's the first time we came across their name. What a find! Great authentically prepared food at very reasonable prices (knowing how japanese cuisine can get pricey). I felt as though I was dining somewhere in Tokyo.,5,HasshuSan,Los Angeles
"serves respectable ""izakaya"" food with fresh specialties of the day although I must say that I was a bit disappointed with the ""fresh"" sashimi of the day. Have had better at Sushiden (of course) but also at Ise, an izakaya that is lot cheaper and also offers very good daily specials as well as a full range of izakaya ""tapas""",3,Zathome,New York Area
Its like a trip to Japan. Awesome.,5,FlyOneWorld,Miami
"Authentic sake joint in midst of Manhattan. The sake list was enormous, all served by the glass. Fortunately, our server was knowledgeable and helped us navigate through a dozen different sakes. The food is small plates, basically to accompany the sake. The place is in the basement with decor that makes it feel like a place to drink. The tables are far apart and often separated by curtain or screens that provides a high level of intimacy in a large space.",4,OpenTable Diner,Los Angeles
Food is of average quality and portion is rather small.,3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
The best lunch special in Manhattan!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Izakaya (Japanese pub food / tapas) with excellent variety and great dishes for sharing. Our server was very willing to help us select a variety of dishes and none disappointed! The price for 4 including drinks was about $260 which is quite reasonable by New York and Tokyo standards. I would make a return visit in a heartbeat.,5,RKRidge,Philadelphia
"SERVICE The staff was very friendly and helpful. I left behind some of my items and they called to tell me I could pick it up any time. They also called to reconfirm my 6:30 reservation the day before and when I asked them if they could change it from 4 to 5 people, they said okay, but I would only have it until 8:45, which was fine.  FOOD must try their UNI SOBA if you like uni. the uni sushi is also fantastic! can't really remember what else we ordered but everything was delicious. note: some of their deserts take 10-15 min to prepare, and since it was 8ish by the time we were ready to eat desert, the waiter told us we could not order those, which was a bummer because he could've told us earlier and had the chef prepare it.",5,OpenTable Diner,Seattle
Amazing food and incredible sake selection. I would think of this as a Japanese tapas place. We lived in Japan for a few years and have really missed authentic Japanese food. Be sure to save room for dessert-the sesame creme brulee is so flavorful!,5,OpenTable Diner,London
"Wonderful food, great sake list.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Great place to have sake and enjoy some wonderful Japanese food. Just don't get there before the restaurant opens - they are very strict and punctual (nothing wrong with that). Definitely a place to let your taste buds run free and try new and interesting dishes. Excellent sake menu - one of the top 5 in the City?,4,OpenTable Diner,Seattle
"I went here out of the recommendation of a friend who's a veteran in izakaya and Japanese food in general. When I asked him what I should get, he said everything there is good. And he's right.  I couldn't be more pleased. Will come back for more.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Very surprising for people who want to discover real japanese food! Very delicate food, very fresh, and good value. But keep in your mind that Sakagura is not a sushi place. Great people, service pleasant. Making the order is a kind of adventure, since you can't really know how the plate/food will look like. But you can't be disappointed, really... Belgium, march 2011",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The food here is wonderful -- very light and unique. Especially like the duck wrapped scallion, eel, tuna tartare. The beef tongue is good but a little salty, and the miso soup is overpriced and not very special. But it's a great spot near Grand Central. Will be coming back.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Consistently great food, with tons of options to try. Polite service with a smile, never feels too stuffy. Decor is understated but beautiful, and really makes it feel like you've left NY. Highly recommended.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
they have an outstanding sake menu.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Located in the basement of a building with no signs to go down the stairs, finding the place was bit of a challenge. Once we got there though, Sakagura suprised us with exceptional food and impeccable service. Decor is not impressive but it has such a relaxed comfortable feel. The beef on the stone pot was so tender and flavorful and the scallops are the perfect texture..they are chewy but melt in your mouth at the same time. The pork belly stew and the shredded beef back rib stew was to die for. You can't go wrong with any dish. Will def go back to try everything on the menu. Beware though, small plates and the drinks(cocktails are tiny but delish!) quickly add up to a hefty bill.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
One of the best Japanese spots in NYC! The sake collection is the outstanding! Service is attentive but not invasive...with a very knowledgeable wait staff...,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"This is our third holiday dinner party at Il Capriccio. As in the past, the service is outstanding, great piano entertainment with holiday carols and generous  menu &amp; specials selections of excellent food &amp; drink. Our waiter was very cordial, never interrupted our conversation or tried to rush us at any stage of our meal and seemed like he was always there to help. Just an enjoyable experience!",5,JJMC,New York Area
"We weren't that impressed, food was ok. Staff were friendly enough but our reservation was at 7:30, we sat on time we still had dinner plates on our table at 9:10...I had to flag the waiter to come over, we didn't stay for dessert.",3,Ronie,New York Area
The experience was excellent with many great food and wine recommendations which were enjoyed by all. The matre d' was very thoughtful and helpful. The fish dishes were wonderful,5,7265,New York Area
Fit for special occasions.  The food is expertly prepared and very professionally served.  I asked for the Branzino which was excluded from the Saturday night menu and our waiter accomodated gladly.  It was prepared at the table with a rare skill. It was delicious as were as were the scallops my wife ordered.  The waiter had an excellent knowlege of the wine list and guided us to the correct choice.  Pricey but excellent value.,5,skibum,New York Area
"Although we've dined there many times before, it had been over a year since we last dined at Il Capriccio's. We've always enjoyed it for it's top-notch menu, great service and ""special-occassion"" ambience...it did not disappoint. The buffalo mozzarella and prosciutto was fantastic as was the boar ossobuco and lamb. The wine list (or book) is very extensive and the barbera D'alba was beautiful. Top off the meal with a fantastic tiramisu and it made for a fantastic meal/evening.",5,vigman,New York Area
The Chilean sea bass was pretty bland for one of their signature dishes. Not enough seasoning and the side that comes with it could be a little better.  The decor is pretty outdated. Service is decent and professional.,4,MKfoodies,New Orleans
The place was very nice and the live piano music was a nice touch. The food was okay for the price. Honestly my mom could make anything they make. The food is really nothing special especially for the price they are charging. Service was good but not great. I did like how they prepared some of the food right in front of you. Overall it was an okay experience. I still prefer Trattoria Toscana on the other side of rt 10. It may not be as nice but I think the food is noticeable better.,3,Alex1133,New York Area
"A classic New Jersey Italian in the best sense of the word!  Great service, traditional atmosphere and wonderful pasta.",5,AppleAnnie12,New York Area
"Il Capriccio always pleases and satisfies to every extent in every detail. You arrive in anticipation and leave with that anticipation satiated. The service is impeccable, the food prepared meticulously and presented flawlessly. The wine list is extensive with a price range to satisfy all. Whether you are having pasta fish or meat for your main meal, you will be happy with your choice. The appetizers to begin with are delightful and the desserts are divine. The amounts served for each course are perfect. The chef knows what he is about and is  certified by the fact that he goes to the tables enquiring about the meals, asking the customers for their comments. I cannot wait for our next visit. This restaurant is a perfect place to celebrate a special occasion.",5,Logistician,New York Area
2nd best restaurant during my NJ trip.   Great place and great food.,4,Rydedivine,Dallas
This as become the go-to place for business dinners. Colleagues in the US and from Europe have begun to look forward to Il Capriccio whenever they are here visiting.  The menu is varied for every taste and the wine list is very extensive.  We especially enjoyed the fine Amarone this evening.  The calamari appetizer was tender and delicious.  The sea bass was delicate and divine.  We haven't had anything here that would disappoint.   My husband thinks the meatball appetizers are just heavenly (as good or better than his Italian mother made) and he orders one every time we're here.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The food, service and atmosphere were all very good but it is a little bit pricey for the size of the entre.",4,DMCNJ2,New York Area
This is your quintessential north jersey upscale Italian restaurant. Great for a romantic date or a special occasion.  The crowd is on the older side.  We felt like we were in a scene from Godfellas. The food was delicious. And service was on point. Our waiter was attentive and was honest with his recommendations. The Flying Meatball appetizer was great and so was the stuffed artichoke heart. For main course the short ribs is the way to go.  We'll definitely be going back.,5,HungryMomma,New York Area
I was a little disappointed that they forgot to sing Happy Birthday to my husband when we got our dessert. They knew it was a surprize Birthday dinner.,5,Mjrjcj,New York Area
I've been going to this restaurant for many years and I can honestly say I've never had a bad experience. They treat you like family and like I'm there every night. Can't wait to go back.,5,TeflonDon,New York Area
"Beautiful evening, delicious food, wonderful service. Look forward to going back and enjoying another lovely meal at II Capriccio!!",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The staff is very pleasant. ..the surroundings, upscale.  The wine pours seem to have shrunken a bit. My entry was rather lifeless but my friend's was delightful.",4,borntodine,New York Area
You are never rushed food always top notch. Waiter was great we split our dessert and brought it out on2 separate plates.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I have been dining at Il Capridcio for years and it never fails to amaze.  Food is prefect, wait staff is superb and the restaurant is just beautiful which makes for a wonderful dining experience.",5,Caralina,New York Area
"We went for lunch with another couple. I would recommend ""Il Capriccio"" with reservations. We had pasta dishes where the dish was too salty for our tastes, and we aren't shy about putting salt on our food.  The piece of lobster tail and claw meat in my squid ink linguine dish were tough, but the large mussels were very good. The buccatini  with peas and prosciutto would have been good if there were less salt in it. Our companions didn't reveal their thoughts to us, so I don't know what they would say about their lunch.  The place is pricey, but it's has linen on the tables. is clean, and the dining room is well run. However, it's not worth for us to drive the easy 35 minutes from our home to go there for dinner.",3,jimbo,New York Area
"I have been going to Il Cappriccio for 25 years. Each and every time I have been there, I walk away saying that it is one of the best dining experiences in New Jersey. Salvatore Le Rose (Maître D’/ Sommelier), could not be the more gracious host. Sal has always welcomed me and my friends and family with open arms. The menu and food is the very best and always fresh. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for and awesome dining experience and the best service around!",5,BobA,New York Area
"Unquestionably, this is the restaurant you want to go to when you want a special night out with that someone special, or with that someone you are hoping to make special.  The service is impeccable (Salvatore is an expert with the wine list, and Dennis, along with the rest of the staff are true professionals in their trade. The Chef knows his business as well. You will NOT be disappointed by choosing il Caproccio which is why it is always my choice for a perfect night out.",5,Logistician,New York Area
My husband and I had a great time at Il Capriccio. Our waiter Allen was very knowledgeable and he filleted the whole fish my husband had ordered perfectly.  The food was very delicious and nicely plated and served. The only thing I did not like so much is that the tables are very close together.,5,Ursel,New York Area
"I went for lunch with co-workers, and this place was amazing!  The food was unreal (try the flying meatballs) and the service was on point.  I usually don't order dessert, but I had to try it here..the canolli's were out of this world!  Definitely re commend if you like Italian food, unique ambiance, and delish food.  Be aware there is a dress code, though!",5,Foodie,New York Area
Italian food spot on. Staff all over service. Great experience.,4,PONY,New York Area
"Il Capriccio never disappoints!   From the minute you arrive until you get in your car to leave, everything about the restaurant exudes quality and service.  The wait staff Is extremely professional without being stiff and the food is outstanding.   I have been there many times and the pasta dishes are always excellent, the fishes (especially the Sea Bass) outstanding and the veal as tender as can be.  I have been to many Italian restaurants in NJ and every time I go to Il Capriccio I wonder why I ever go anywhere else!",5,Sgengaro,New York Area
"Great food, Great service, Tony continues to deliver a great dining experience.",5,602a,New York Area
This was my first time to this restaurant and everyone who worked there made us feel comfortable and treated specially. The bar was a relaxing place and the great service continued all night.,5,Cherk,New York Area
"Meatball appetizer was very good. My wife had the gnocchi and loved it. I had the seafood entree with lobster, shrimp and scallops and it was outstanding. My wife also had cannoli's and they were different but outstanding. All good. Food service, etc. what you expect at a high end restaurant.",5,Glenn,New York Area
Excellent menu selections as well as excellent when the food arrived. Beautiful and comfortable environment.,4,Marty,New York Area
"This establishment is alwayws on the short list of places to go to for a notable dining experience. It has never failed to please and satisfy. The food, service, wine, ambience combine to make an evening here satisfying and memorable. The entire staff take the time to ensure that you have a good time. It is a formula for success.",5,Logistician,New York Area
"Great location. Moderate to expensive fare but it was expected and portions are generous. I would come back to celebrate.  There was a live pianist which created a nice environment. Assortment of sales people, work groups with clients, and couples celebrating.   The owner/manager introduced themselves and asked if we needed anything. It was obvious it was my first time there to her. I am guessing there is a lot of repeat business and I can see why.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I hosted a business dinner at this venue. Everyone enjoyed the food and ambiance.  As place was quite, we were able to enjoy our conversations.",5,YogeshSatra,New York Area
"I took my wife and two sons to this place for Mother's day. it's my wife favorite restaurant in Morris county. The food is great with the exception of baby clams pasta special of the day (it's too salty). However, the waiter was wonderful. He tried to accommodate me by redoing the dish again (without clams. It ran out). When it turned out still too salty he offered me for another dish (NY steak) which I took. The fish, lamb and veal were so great! The place is beautiful. We are definitely be back.",5,ptcas71,New York Area
"The food was excellent, and table service was great, but the host was very snooty.",3,LaurenceR,Columbus
Il Capriccio is always a great place to go for a special occasion for us.  Whether it is Christmas Eve dinner or Anniversaries or a Birthday.  The wait staff are attentive to all of your needs and make good suggestions on wine pairings.  The food is top notch as well.  It is of course pretty expensive but you get more than what you pay for in service and ambiance.,5,OpenTable Diner,Philadelphia
"Me and my partner went to Sakagura on 04/01/2010. From the outside we were unsure what to make of a restaurant in the basement but as soon as we peeked through the curtain at the restaurant we were far from disappointed. Myself and my now fiance both love our food although we have very little experience of Japanese cuisine. The restaurant was lively and exciting and as we were unsure what to order our waiter was extremely helpful with his recommendations. The food was really good and we tried a sake tasting menu to get us into the swing of things. Overall it was a very enjoyable evening and if you decide to go make sure you order steak dish, the sauce is to die for!",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

$11.50 Daily Lunch offers very good value.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Lunch special's Ebi Ten Toji don was excellent- though it's a bit pricey.,3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Sakagura is the Japanese restaurant recommended to me by my friends from Japan when I asked them for a recommendation of a place where I could get authentic cuisine. The dishes aren't like what you find at other places: chilled sliced duck breast with basil sauce, deep fried mashed potato balls with sea salt, etc. And they are amazingly tasty, with incredible consistency of execution. Every time I go, the food is fabulous. The sake list is also very extensive. Hidden away in a basement you might overlook Sakagura, but you shouldn't. It is a hidden gem.",5,Daria,New York Area
"Terrific! I've been to your restaurant at least 6 times with different friends and it's always a wonderful evening! Great food, wonderful sake, terrific service! Hope to be back again soon.",5,DAS45,New York Area

"Great izakaya-style food, and an extensive sake list. The staff are very helpful and knowledgable.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I have eaten here several times, love the food, decor, and that the restaurant is hidden away. However, this visit the spacing of the food being served was very erratic - the sashimi came almost instantly, and the next dish took over a half hour to appear...even the miso soup. More importantly, my friend and I ordered the $48 sashimi plate. We asked about fish type and size, and were told it would be enough to share. When the bill came the plate was $62. Upon questioning, the waiter said the price increase was because they put 5 extra pieces of fish. This was not at all explained when we ordered, and the price increase was definitely not noted at any point in the meal before the check arrived. Not happy with how restaurant handled.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Never a disappointment here. Always FRESH sushi. Love it!,5,OpenTable Diner,Denver

"Through an anonymous Midtown East office building... down a concrete stairwell that looks like you're heading to a boiler room... through another door, and... you're in a cozy Japanese bistro with quietly efficient service, delicious (cooked, no sushi here) food, and a very impressive sake list, which you can experiment with via their 'pre-programmed' flights... It is very good, was a lot of fun, and my whole gang wants to go back next time we're in NYC.",5,JimBobGA57,Atlanta
Great non traditional Japanese// sushi,4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Sake lovers must try this place. They have 200+ sake. The food is very good, too.",4,Mmmm,New York Area
"This is a really popular place. Anyone who wants to have a try should made a reservation first, or you might have to wait. The food there is good. I only chose one plate of sashimi and noodle. The sashimi is very fresh. The noodle tastes good. But I am not sure whether I should put all ingredients and vegetables into the bowl or not.",3,sansannee,New York Area
"I can't say enough good things about Sakagura. The instant you walk in, the decor transports you to Japan. The exquisite food makes you forget where you are. There's only you and your taste buds, reveling in the magic the chefs manage to conjure out of the simplest ingredients.",5,Disappointed,New York Area
"Great food although service could be a little better. We were sake novices and waiter was unable to guide us on what to order, so ended up with beers and other drinks. Otherwise, great place! I've been a few times now and always enjoy the food.",4,nycdiner,New York Area
Food was really great and deserts. Hostess and service was just ok.,4,Diner,London
Best Sake list by far!!!!!!!! Great food!,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Food was great except for Yuba Shumai, which was very dry and tough. I think I could have made the same thing with ingredients from my local supermarket back in the boring Midwest! Otherwise, most of the seafood dishes had good flavor and tasted fresh. Grilled chicken with salt was also excellent.  Our waiter was a little awkward, however. He showed his emotions a little too much (being a little dismissive, which is a bit impolite ) because my friend was not familiar with the Sake list. He was also a bit impatient when we were ordering food, although the restaurant was pretty empty when we arrived (so what's the rush?). Not sure if he was handed other tasks to complete so he had to rush through everything.",4,Bear,New York Area
This place is phenomenal for lunch and is a well kept local secret! Get their tasting menu- its a death row meal for me! The sesame Creme Brûlée with sesame ice cream is a must.,5,Arix777,New York Area

"Never have had a bad experience here. On this last visit, I was treated to a specially reserved table (for return customers), incredibly attentive service, and a menu that always has new additions and specials. This is really one of my favorite restaurants of all time, and every time I go back I remember why.",5,DMoney,New York Area
In the basement of an office building on 43rd is this little gem: a noodle-oriented place with good sashimi and a great sake list.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

It is refreshing to find authentic Japanese cuisine at Sakagura amidst other so called Japanese or Japanese fusion restaurants in NY which serve pretentious Japanese cuisine.,5,OpenTable Diner,Los Angeles
"I was so blown-away by the quality and tastiness of the food the first time I was there, that I couldn't wait to go back again. Everything that we ordered was fresh and delicious. Staff were attentive and efficient. Even though it was busy, the restaurant was not loud and the environment was just right for an evening of good conversation. I'm looking forward to my next visit there, soon.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

"I lunch at Faces with my co workers a couple of times a month.  The menu is consistently solid with typical bar food, burgers, sandwiches etc, as well as specials which are tasty and reasonably priced. I had a smoked salmon salad which was very tasty and a lighter meal.  My co workers had the bacon burgers, black bean burger and the portabella mushroom sandwich which they enjoyed.  The curly fries and onion rings are really great.  The staff is friendly and attentive.  We are going back later this week.",4,Ienjoyeatingout,New York Area
Good food at a reasonable price. I have eaten lunch here with coworkers several times and have not had a bad meal yet. The chicken and avocado sandwich is one of my favorites and have had it on different occasions with curly fries or salad. On my last visit my coworker had the black beam burger and it was surprisingly delicious. I am sure we'll return soon.,4,Ienjoyeatingout,New York Area
"Went here after work with coworkers for a few drinks. They have a nice drink menu and a delicious selection of appetizers - hot pretzel bites, mini tacos, sliders, little cubanos, mozzarella bites. Service is very good also. Also affordably priced (as far as NYC goes).  I've also been here for lunch twice since then and both times I was back at my desk in an hour without feeling rushed.  Lunch menu is nice and food is good.",4,KK78,New York Area
"This bar/restaurant is a great, affordable find in the 50s. My friend and I ordered off the brunch menu and enjoyed our omelette and freshly made black bean burger, respectively. Jayne, our server, has a bright smile and a friendly, charming demeanor. She could not have been more helpful and accommodating. We'll be back!",4,lizzieh,New York Area
"Everyone at faces and names was super friendly so I feel terrible to say this..but the service was beyond slow. The place was not busy at all so I don't know why we were there for 2 hours just for lunch. The food was very good and again, everyone was very friendly so for that reason I will return...I will just anticipate being there longer then expected.",3,KristenS,Philadelphia
"I held a reunion here over the weekend with 30 guests. I planned ahead with management and there were very attentive to my needs. Ate a quick meal of apps and they were great. Other guests ordered more extensive items and they looked great and I was told they were good. Drinks were very good and nice staff. The area in the rear with sofas was very nice for us to hang out and talk to people we had not seen in many years. Yet, had a nice big TV for the NCAA games so no one missed out on that while having a good time with old friends. A shout out to the staff there that were very nice and that we had an excellent time.",4,eggs,New York Area

"Didn't need a reservation for brunch since it was very quiet and opened a Noon. however,, saying that the brunch was good, the price reasonable, and I loved the Bloody Mary!",4,Harriet,New York Area
"Our waitress insisted that I order off the the wine list, even though all the wines-by-the-glass are also conveniently listed on the food menu. There are only five choices, but she insisted condescendingly to help me choose, recommending the riesling, guessing with a veiled sneer that I'd order the pinot grigio, and then looking surprised that I could pronounce sauvignon blanc. We ordered dumplings and stuffed mushrooms as appetizers, and caprese salad and grilled protobello sandwich entrees. All were serviceable, but forgettable, at this place that claims to serve comfort food. Funky caricature portraits of entertainment industry celebrities are fun, but the best art in the house is on the very fine coasters.",2,Martinez,New York Area
"awful. a dark, dingy bar with a few poorly placed tables.",1,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Food was fabulous and server was wonderful. Very noisy so difficult to carry on conversation with others at the table.,4,whatever3333,Dallas
"This was our first time there. I loved how the concept of the place was pub-like, with appetisers and drinks, it was just the way to start off a weekend night in NYC! We had a large group of 7 meeting up there, and the banquet tables with cushioned seats in the back were perfect for a comfortable gathering of a large group. The waitresses were very attentive, and the food was delicious (we ordered the spring rolls and chicken mini-tacos. We loved how the appetisers come already portioned to share with a group (7 per plate) and it helped set the evening off. While the drink bill was a little pricey, we will definitely return again.",4,TneckMOM,New York Area
Good spot for lunch before a matinee.,3,CurlyQ,New York Area
"This is not a great place for dinner, but a great place for drinks. While the food they have is good and the menu is broad for a bar, the dark lighting, loud music and hightop tables (mostly) cue this more for a bar/lounge than restaurant. However, the staff is amazingly kind, helpful and fast - terrific! It's a great place to go with drinks in mind and an ""OK"" place to eat meal for dinner (lunch would be pretty good!",3,AdSmith,New York Area
"We visited for lunch and were able to relax and watch the Olympics on the huge screens. The food and service were outstanding. We plan to go back and try the dinner menu. There is ample, comfortable seating around a fireplace in the back which would be a great place to meet friends for drinks.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
An ideal place to meet up with friends for a beverage and some fun. Love the cool paintings on the walls and seating provided modern but cozy feel for a group gathering. The proximity to the Hilton made it an just fabulous!,5,DinerDame,Anchorage
"Great place, great prices. Service was outstanding and food was tasty and prompt!",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"restaurant seating was not available - we sat at bar, which was fine - glad there were plenty of seats as we were a party of 5, even tho' two teenagers were with us. The place had a tired feel about it but the food was good and the location was great as we were seeing the show at Radio City.",2,LindaZ,New York Area
"If you have been to Japan, you will definitely appreciate a place like Sakagura. Like many restaurants in Japan, it is located in the basement of a nondescript office building. Once seated, it's easy to forget you are in New York City, due to the well-prepared dishes and extensive/exhaustive sake list. I went here expecting a lot, and Sakagura delivered. The only downside that I would suggest, is that if you have a vegetarian in your party, be sure to ask them about vegetarian dishes. We ordered a fried tofu item that made no mention of bonito shavings in the description, but then arrived with some on top. Otherwise, a fantastic night out! This place will be on the ""must list"" any time I return to New York.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Very interesting menu selections. We ordered six items. The agedashi tofu was wonderful as was the grilled calamari (but way too salty) and chicken karaage. The house specialty pork belly had good flavor but nothing really special about it. The beef rib and mashed potatoes in a donut type batter were just ok.,4,Jayne,San Francisco
"nothing beats fresh soba, and this place knows just that! know that it's in a basement of an office building, so can be easy to miss...",4,GoodEatz,Chicago
"Known for its sake selection, Sakagura also has incredible food. I can't stop thinking about the uni soba seasonal special. Every dish we ordered was so flavorful and expertly prepared. We ordered several plates of the spinach and sesame (Gomaae) appetizer because it was so addictive. The subterranean entrance and unappealing ""lobby"" (where you will wait if you arrive before the dinner service starts at 6pm) may seem odd, but will make sense once you eat -- Sakagura does not need to focus on decor or getting noticed when the food is this good.",5,mojavejen,New York Area
"I love this place, but if I had to pick on a problem, it woukd be the ventilation of the place. There's not once I've been there did I not feel stuffy there. Coming out of the restaurant you would right away feel you need a shower as you smelled like you've been in the kitchen cooking for a long time.....if only there's something the management can do to take care of that, this place would be perfect!!",4,Pookeyl3,New York Area
"Amazing non-traditional food, great ambiance, exceptional service, but a little pricey on the alcohol side. Except 50% or more of your bill to be booze if you're getting sake.",5,DMoney,New York Area
"Finally a real Japanese restaurant with fantastic soba &amp; amazing daily lunch specials. Ambiance is similar to what you would find in Japan, with gracious efficient service. Huge sake menu &amp; creative desserts as well!",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Sakagura essentially serves excellently crafted Japanese bar food. For me, these kinds of Japanese tapas is the best kind of comfort food and Sakagura does theirs with such quality ingredients, preparation, and style that it really becomes a culinary art. I found out about this place 5 years ago and go there at least a few times a year and it has remained consistently good. Hope this never changes!",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
The food and service are outstanding. We will definitely be back!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Best sake menu in the USA Surprise basement venue. Best izakaya food experience I have ever had Flawless experience overall,5,stutzco,San Francisco
Amazing Sashimi and Sake! Best in the city!,5,OnTheDL,New York Area
"You know you've found a gem when you see the crowd is almost all Japanese-American...after descending a service stairway to be swept into a no-holds-barred Japanese izakaya.  The sake selection is excellent.  I wasn't a sake drinker until the bartender introduced us to a choice selection that we now get a bottle of every time.  All the tapas-style izakaya food is masterfully prepared, beautiful, and delicious.  When my family comes to visit, they make reservations here without consulting me anymore; they just tell me we're going, and I don't complain.  This is become my treat to myself in the city.  Only confusion is whether the restrooms are unisex...",5,Ryan,New York Area
Very extensive sake list and great food: like being in Tokyo.,5,piero,New York Area
Food was amazing and they have an impressive list of sake. Service was very nice. But don't try shoyu (soy-sauce) ice cream :(,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Unbelievable Sake collection!!!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Probably one of the best authentic Japanese restaurants by far! Everytime I order these dishes - it's a home run - grilled eel salad, sake-don, &amp; ribs! The peach dessert is outstanding as well! Since it is in the basement - it's an awesome hidden gem but definitely the lines will let you know it's a hot spot. Reservations strongly recommended or you will sit at the bar.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Beautiful setting. The food as lovely as it was beautiful. The waiter, a joy.",5,Mehrlich,Denver
"Unfortunately, the lunch menu is not as extensive as the dinner menu.",4,OpenTable Diner,Los Angeles
"After living for over 3 years in Tokyo, finding Sakagura on our last visit to NYC was such a treat! This is one of the most authentic Japanese places I have been in the states. The setting is pure Tokyo....down a dingy staircase to a hidden gem of a spot. They are decorated just like the places we would go in Japan. Large sake barrels, wood bar, bottles of sake, a shrine in the corner...all very authenic. They start you out with the hot towels to clean your hands/face. Again, one of our favorite things about dining out in Japan. The sake selection is ridiculous! Luckily the servers are very knowledgeable and will guide you to what you'll enjoy. Food was creative, fresh and delicious. Definitely will be back!",5,Nancy,New York Area
"I wouldn't come here for the food, very basic american menu but its a cute place to stop in for a drink with some friends.",3,jajayyyyy,New York Area
"Faces and Names was fine for a bar, but not as a restaurant. It's really just a bar that serves food. It didn't have real tables and a reservation wasn't needed. But the service was good and the food was good and reasonably priced.",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Great services. I had the buffalo chicken salad which I wasn't that crazy about.,4,Mikeyboxx,New York Area
"I imagine this place might be jumping on a typical evening, but for our early lunch it was beyond quiet. Basically a bar with caricatures on the walls (some of them quite good) and bar food that's well done but nothing special. It wasn't exactly what we had in mind when we made the (as it turns out, unnecessary) reservations, but we gave it a try anyway. The activity level picked up through our meal, which was delivered quickly and competently. I was concerned that the deep fried items might be soggy since it was so early, but the fryer was ready and the chef up to the task. For our tastes there are more appropriate eateries in the area, but if bar food is on your radar, by all means give them a try.",3,Ulysses,Jacksonville
"It was so loud we had to scream at each other to carry on a conversation. Otherwise, the place is great.",3,LYL17,New York Area
"i don't think this should even be included in your listings. the place was empty except for 2 tables of teenagers obviously in town on spring break on a tour or class trip. They were having a good time and there was laughter and noise, but that was ok - except the hostess (bartender) indicated we should sit right next to them when the whole place was empty - when we mentioned this she casually said, oh, sit anywhere...it went downhill from there.",1,rocky,New York Area
Very reasonable brunch menu. We were a little disappointed with the basic hamburger bun. Food well-prepared &amp; to our liking.,4,OpenTable Diner,Jacksonville
I made this reservation for 3am and I arrived early. I'm glad i did as the kitchen closes at 3am. My server mentioned that they never get reservations at 3am. The bar was very loud as the bartender was VERY loud as I guess he was entertaining his crowd.,2,Blacklug2013,New York Area
"Faces and Names is a good moderately priced bar/restaurant in Midtown. It is great for drinks and a meal and for after work hang out. I had a very good Alsace Reisling. The salad was pretty good but they put ""prosciutto"" in the salad that was just way too salty. In addition, they fried the prosciutto which is really confusing because prosciutto is not fried,it was like uber-salty bacon. I think it is akin to frying smoked salmon. Why would you do that? Otherwise the salad was good, it would have been better if I had not paid the additional $2 for ruined prosciutto. My friend said her tuna steak was good but was not rare like she ordered. Service was friendly and prompt.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
We had a nice lunch except for the fact that this guy next to us was laughing so LOUD that the entire restaurant can here him. It disturbed our entire meal. I wish the wait staff would have said something.,3,Mikeyboxx,New York Area
Overall I would have to say quite disappointed in the entire experience especially the service - seemed like only one wait person for the whole restaurant at noon for Sunday Brunch -Also they DO NOT have decaf coffee - hello its 2010 no decaf coffee?? At least they allowed me to go across the street to a deli and bring in a cup of decaf. Others we were with ordered eggs benedict and the eggs were hard boiled and no sauce. My burger was pretty good although I had to ask 2 times for ketchup which should have been brought with the burger.  The location was great for the show we were seeing but based on lack of service I doubt I would go back,2,FOODMOM,New York Area

F&amp;N is a Bar and Lounge. Very different food offerings. Nothing much over $10.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I can't really say as we were turned away at the door (with a reservation). Seems like a nice, hip place. We will try again.",1,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The food at Catch is very well done. We had the scallop and swordfish entrees. The swordfish was done very simple but well. The scallop dish is excellent, a menu highlight. For apps we had the hamachi tartare and the crunchy rice cakes. The ""rice cake"" on the latter was a little heavy for my taste but the fish was fresh and very good. The atmosphere is very meatpacking. At times it felt like everyone else in the restaurant knew each other.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Very hip and fun restaurant and bar with great food and drinks!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I had the mussels for appetizer and it was delicious. I love mussels and always order them where ever I go, but this by far was the best! I also had the branzino and also delicous!",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

"It was a fabulous restaurant. It was just a bit too loud for me, but it was the energy level and I managed.",5,ademp,Toronto
Catch is super hip with a menu that has traditional seafood as well as Asian-infused menu options with creative cocktails. The service was excellent as well as the food. I want to go back.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

"I was really looking forward to this meal and I was not disappointed. While the tables are very close and the noise level is frenetic, the food was extremely tasty. The crispy shrimp and lettuce wraps were delicious. Several of us shared the surf and turf which was really enough for two, if not three people. Steak was soft and tasty and the lobster cantonese was yummy too. We had the most pleasant waitress who suggested the chocolate dessert which was a great way to finish the meal. Caution.. definitely pricey but worth it.",4,wassermom,New York Area
We were a party of eleven ....our table a banquet was spacious ... The food and service was wonderful ...one dish was better than the next... Fun to share ... Cant forget the warm pretzels The desserts the best ...we were happy the entire time ...and didn't want the ratting experience at CATCH to end !,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Good food, but noise level way too high and way too expensive. Would probably not go back.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"We loved our first time at Catch! The food was excellent and our server, Jacob, was exceptional. The restaurant is a bit noisy, so not very conducive to conversation. Overall, though, it was a great experience. We look forward to eating there again soon (provided we can get a very coveted reservation!).",4,kac923,New York Area
This place never disappoints. All of the food is fresh and delicious. The menu is great as well as the mixed drinks. The service is also impeccable! I highly recommend this place to everyone!,5,OpenTable Diner,Orange County

"Not sure why so many people complained about the service. We were sited right away and the hostess was very professional. Our waiter Tim was on top of everything. I had the snapper and it was cooked perfectly. My friend had the scallops, they also were cooked to perfection. We had the oysters which were amazing and the baked clams, yum! I will go back in heart beat. Catch was vibrant and so alive. I forgot the name of the dessert, but it was three different ice creams with a banana that was cooked, oh so good. Trust me folks, we are foodies.",4,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
Very disappointed overall the service was so slow &amp; generally very poor. The attitude of the staff was almost as though they hadn't been trained.Shame because thd food was very good but the overall experience was so bad I really wouldn't return!,1,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I WAIT 45 MINUTES,FOR THE TABLE",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The food is better than it has to be for a ""hipstaurant"". We didn't have a dud dish in the bunch. However, it's hard to escape the nagging feeling that chef Hung is capable of more. The restaurant is as much trying to be a lounge and scene as it is a serious dining venue, possibly because of its location. And while the food is very good, the menu consists mostly of retreads of dishes we've seen at other restaurants over the last 10 years. Let's hope Hung takes his considerable talents to the next level, and opens a serious restaurant that showcases his full ability.",4,LPSNY,New York Area
One of the better meals I have had in living memory.,5,maximman121,New York Area
"Food was solid, done well. Host staff is atrocious. Sat us in a section that the server didn't start working in until 12 minutes after we sat down. For 12 minutes, no bread, no water, no drinks, no wine list- nobody even approached the table. After server approached the table, we were rushed. Not rushing to get back.",3,Justaguy,Washington DC
"After hearing great things about Catch, we were anxious to check it out. We dine out frequently and enjoy trying new spots every Friday. Unfortunately, the food was mediocre, and I believe our waitress was new. People who sat after us all received their courses prior to us. That wasn't a big deal as I understand we all have to start somewhere. The crab cake was full of crab ""filler"" or imitation meat with a thick fries layer on the outside. The snapper was ok, nothing special. I can say that the drinks were good. We selected 2 of the specialty cocktails. Overall. The experience was average and we are not in a rush to return.",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
The service was not good. We waited 30 minutes past our reservation before being seated and 60 minutes until we gave our order.,3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Very good food and service. Way too noisy and too much of a scene. The bar overwhelms the dining space! Also, the hostesses could do well to lose their attitude. My dining at your restaurant is paying your salary so you could at least present to be nice.",3,Pmharry,New York Area
"This was my second and last time at Catch .. There are so many better choices in the Meatpacking District of the city .. My entre was undercooked and needed to be sent back .. the ""lavo-styled"" eatery/nightclub atmosphere and crowd is tiring. Go elsewhere.",2,lostinjerz,New York Area
"great food from all parts of the menu (sushi, hot plates, pastas, entrees). very attentive wait staff, fun vibe (but loud), great cocktails and the food is still the star of the show. crispy shrimp, crispy rice, crab pasta, lobster mash &amp; snapper were delicious. can't go wrong here. dessert great, too. we'll be back very soon. thanks again.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The location was EXTREMELY, EXTREMELY noisy. Too noisy, especially given it was after 10PM when we sat down to eat. Definitely NOT the place to go when on a date or you want to talk without shouting to the person sitting across from you. Be prepared to become best buds with the people sitting at the tables next to you since tables are closely situated to one another to take advantage of the valuable real estate. Food was good. Service was polite, but not as attentive as it should have been. Pricing of food was actually reasonable. Drink pricing was higher than expected. If you want to people / celebrity watch, it's the place to be....at least on a Monday.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
food was tasty but WAY too expensive for what it is!,3,wendrwoman,New York Area
"Churn and burn. This place just wants you to come in, eat and leave. Service comprised of slamming plates on table, leaning over to pour water and try to push you out very quickly. One of party was actually poked in the arm by wait staff to gain attention to ask if she had finished! Pity, as the food was actually quite nice. Would never go again though.",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
We didn't get the seating we had hoped/requested for.  As noted in the special requirements section.,3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Every time I take people there we get the best service in town. They give us plenty of time to select items and to linger over coffee.

"I love one sandwich and the ambience at Faces and Names, but I swear, I'm going to start ordering what I DON'T want because I think I'll have a better chance of having what I do want come out of the kitchen. This place has never, not once, not screwed up my order. This time, chose salad option instead of fries and fries came out. The wait staff is surly and they don't know their own menu. Me: no cheese on that please. Waitress: it doesn't come with chess. Me: we it say mozzarella on the menu so can you please make sure it doesn't have it. I'm not entirely sure why I keep going back. Once they do get the mushroom sandwich order right, it's really good. Super loud this time around tho. You couldn't hear anything but yelling.",2,Elfields,New York Area

"We had two vegetarians in our group. We both ordered the mushroom sandwich, which I've had before and is very good. We ordered one without cheese and one with. Waited repeated the order back to us. Both came with cheese, so we sent one back. What came back was a reuben, which made us check the other sandwich: also a reuben. Luckily, my friend hadn't bitten into it. We tried to send both back, and the waiter argued that even the mushroom sandwich has meat on it (it's not listed that way on the menu, and it doesn't come with meat). We had to argue with our waiter just to get what we ordered!! Still, I'll come back because maybe he is one bad egg. The food here is really good and fairly priced for this area. Plus, the ambiance is pretty cool. Sit by the fireplace.",3,Elfields,New York Area
"What a wonderful, fairly-priced place in Midtown. The hostess was kind enough to seat us by the fireplace even though the table was huge and we were only a party of 3. The atmosphere was comfy and casual.  My only complaint is the shrimp cocktail,  which tasted like, well, nothing. The other food was so so, except for the mushroom sandwich, which was surprisingly delightful. I'd come back.",4,Elfields,New York Area

When we did get our food, it was not correct &amp; one of the meals had to be sent back. When it came back, it was still not correct &amp; I told them to just take it off the bill.

"I've been there after a matinee and it's packed with a young-ish after-work crowd. A friend told me brunch is a great bargain so we went on Saturday before our show two blocks west.  ""Great bargain"" is the correct term. You have about eight choices for a brunch costing $12.95. And that includes a very good bloody mary, normally $10 on the bar menu. And when of the two sides is a mound of crisp bacon. Two fillings I picked for a good omelet were prosciutto and swiss cheese. Plus home fries. $12.95! Despite blaring rap music and the going-through-the-motions hostess who doubled as our waitress, I'd definitely go back for this deal.",4,Jude,Philadelphia

It is in a great location and the restaurant itself is very nice and ambient.  There is great artwork of celebrity faces .  The waitress was extremely sweet and attentive.

Les fenêtres qui donnent sur la rue étaient grande ouvertes permettant une bonne aération de la pièce, c'est très appréciable quand on mange. Nous recommendons vivement cette adresse à tous les touristes de passage.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
We went to Faces for Fathers Day brunch .  The menu was very limited and is probably more suited for an evening pub venture . It is in a great location and the restaurant itself is very nice and ambient.  There is great artwork of celebrity faces .  The waitress was extremely sweet and attentive.  The price was reasonable for brunch with coffee and a breakfast cocktail.  The food was ok but not something I would put on my most memorable list of have to have again.,4,WendyB,New England
"Great pub food; but the crowd was too young and noisy for us.  If you are not old fogeys like we are, I highly recommend it.",3,ihatenicknames,New York Area
I love this place! The spicy shrimp is superb! Great service and good value for money! Will be back!,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Food was outstanding. Very noisy and closely packed tables. This is clearly a popular restaurant.,4,Worldtraveler,Philadelphia
"Surprisingly unique for primarily a ""fish"" restaurant. But the many ways they prepare the ""catch"" of the day were creative and delicious! The mix of Asian spices brought with them an explosion of flavor and aromas. We had the hot and spicy roll, the whole Snapper (divine!), a beet salad (yes, beets) with greens and feta cheese that caught us by surprise. Fun place too - lots of great energy! From other diners, wait staff, and the thriving meat packing district!",5,LindaLane1,Miami
Just too expensive for what you get.,2,SM1234,New York Area
"Hip place with shortcomings. Given the fact that prices are above average should not startle anyone - great food in cool surroundings in a hip neighbourhood does not always come cheap. But the fact that this restaurant does not know how to tie the ends on a truly great dining experience is annoying. Serving a miserable Gin and Tonic that reeks from alcohol and poor tonic is not the best way to begin a great dinner and finishing by serving the worst espresso I ever had at a restaurant is a downright lousy finish. It's simply nothing short of sloppy. Add to this that you are being paced through your dinner in ordre to turn tables - not uncommon but still annoying. To sum it up: great food, mediocre experience and a high price.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Had a great time! The only thing was we had ordered some sides, and after a while, they remembered that they ordered them, and it was another 20 minutes before we got them.",4,Foodie100,New York Area
Way too expensive fo what you get. they serve very little food. only three shrimp in an entree!!!!!!!!!,2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Definitely eat Hung's signature dish (dish he won on Top Chef),5,ENCBV,New York Area
"Horrendous service, mediocre food and uninspired space. We waited 30 minutes to sit (even though we had a reservation). It took almost another half hour to see a menu and flag down a waiter to order. The food was poorly executed and not worth the wait. Booooooo",1,Jhansen,New York Area
Food was amazing!!! Got the sauteed snapper and will come back again!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Fun, hot spot. Food was good. Lots of energy. Though service was fair. Would definitely go back with a group!",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Excellent seafood in Manhattan!,5,OpenTable Diner,New England
Great food and wonderful service,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
The entire experience was terrible. We got to the restaurant at around 10 for a drink beforehand and once we checked in at 10:40 - we still had to wait until 11:00 to be seated. Every time I went up to check on our table the hostess would ignore me or walk away. Our reservation was at 10:45. The server was INCREDIBLY rude and not pleasant in the least bit. I was bringing visitors from out of town and EVERYONE was complaining. We ordered our meals and they were out of the Mahi Mahi which I wanted. We also ordered a mixed seafood appetizer for the table and it NEVER came. They also didn't bring a side we ordered with our meals.IT WAS JUST ALL AROUND TERRIBLE! And not once did the server say she was sorry for any inconveniences or error,1,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
No customer service. Would never return to this restaurant. A waste of time.,1,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Best dinner I ever had. The lobster was amazing.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Great for groups. Especially if planning on going out afterwards. As opposed to other restaurants from mark and Eugene (co-owners) where food is mediocre, here they actually did a really good job. All the appetizers are very decent (oysters, belly-fat salmon and tuna stickyrice niguiris) and main course was outstanding (whole red snapper). Would definotely go back.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Catch is a fine seafood restaurant with excellent food in a beautiful setting,4,gourmetdiner,New York Area
The restaurant kept us waiting for a long time before sitting us. However they did buy us a drink. The food was great.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Worth the hype. Yes, it's the place to be seen, but the food is delicious, so it's worth waiting for the reservation, crowds, etc. Two complaints, however, are some of the dishes are quite heavy and rich, which I found surprising. Stick to the grilled menu if you're looking for light. Also, skip the cookie basket on the desert menu - very disappointing.",4,spfnyc,New York Area
Food was cold and incorrect. Staff leading to club was rude,1,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"amazing food and impeccable service, cannot wait to visit again =)",5,Karianne05,New York Area
"The sushi and sashimi was incredibly sweet and tender. I had the red snapper with truffles and lobster mash. Big chunks of lobster in mashed potatoes-- who wouldn't love that? And perfectly prepared succulent snapper. The apple pie was yummy with a perfect flakey buttery crust. The service was exactly what it should be-- attentive but not cloying. We ate upstairs. We had one of the few four tops. There were mainly larger parties (including one huge table) in a full restaurant on a Monday night but somehow, the wait staff was always there when we needed them. It is a little loud-- especially with large parties-- so don't expect an intimate dining experience. Expect a fun time with great service and outstanding food.",5,okcfoodie,Oklahoma City
The lobster Mac &amp; Cheese was outstanding. The branzino was great as well as all the other appetizers we shared.,4,daisy,New York Area
The food was very good - The Red Snapper was cooked perfectly and the tuna sashimi was excellent. The high prices are what you would expect for a place like this in Manhattan.,3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
The food was ok. But we were placed under an airco and it was freezing. I asked staff 3 times if something could be done but they did not return with feedback. With the place half empty they should have offered me another seat or just tell me it could not be changed.,3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"An excessive amount of waitstaff but surprisingly poor service. My guest and I moved tables because the banquet is so much lower than the chair and it was uncomfortable for the two of us to be at such different levels sitting across from each other. Once we sat at the new table, we could see the two waitresses literally fighting over who would get our table. This same scene went on with the bartender and cocktail waitress when we first arrived. I do not recommend.",1,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"When you arrive at Catch and see the scene you might think the restaurant will just be another trendy Meatpacking spot, but you would be wrong. They did an amazing job combining great food, a beautiful industrial looking space and cool scene. Everything we ordered from raw bar was fresh and delicious. The lobster mac and cheese really differentiates itself from the 100 other restaurants that have attempted this dish. The Cantonese Lobster had a perfect flavor. Our waitress was very personable and gave great reccomendations. My second time to Catch and I will be back.",5,Ezuke22,New York Area
"Bar is crowded, Drinks too expensive, plenty of uptown Ladies on a man hunt which creates a vibrant ""saturday night, live is allright"" energy (even on weekdays). The food is good, no surprises but of high standards, wine menu more with unreasonable prices than with its variety. In fact catch is less of a restaurant and more of a stage for wannabes with some good food. After the restaurant wie want to try the rooftop bar, access denied by an unfriedly doorman "" only guest list or reservation"" - not the right way to treat Clients who spent 400 bucks on a party for two. Sorry - Catch has not caught us.",2,OpenTable Diner,Berlin
Service is so poor that it really makes it difficult to swallow an otherwise great tasting meal. It's too bad. I won't go back.,3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"We had a 7:45 reservation and were seated closer to 9pm. Yes we were given a round of free drinks, but over an hour wait is crazy! What's the point of making a reservation . Appetizers were good but diner was questionable. My Guest had the grilled Tuna and it lacked taste. Overall I would not recommend the restaurant and have such mentioned that to my coworkers in our office.",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
FOOD OVERRATED. WAS'NT IMPRESSED AT ALL. OVERPRICED,2,FOODIE,New York Area
Good find. Nice decor and good fish....,4,JollyRogers,Los Angeles
Went to Catch to celebrate our anniversary. The food was excellent - service impeccable. Even the hot pretzel basket rather than typical bread was a treat. Would definitely recommend,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"nice ambience in meatpacking. Food, avarage.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Everything was excellent,it was my wifes birthday and we drove in from Long Island,I would reccomend the catch to anyone who wants seafood and willing to go into the city.  Thank you",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
This is my 5th o 6th visit to Catch in 4 weeks. I LOVE IT. The food is fantastic. The service brilliant and the cocktails spectacular! I'll be better equipped to write a review after I eat there about 20 more times!,5,OpenTable Diner,Los Angeles
We loved our dinner!! Evertything was delicious!! The desserts were also unbelievable. There is nothing bad to say about this restaurant. We also brought our kids and they loved the place also. Its definitely a trendy scene so book your reservation early.,5,OpenTable Diner,Miami
Fun place to go with friends. Noisy because everyone is having such a great time. Would definitely go back. We even got to meet Hung!,5,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
Loved the food but was kind of pricey for the portions. Will def come back again for the scallops. They were beyond awesome.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Attentive service, but steep prices",5,JosephS,New York Area
"LOVED our experience at Catch. Pretty typical Meatpacking scene, so if that's not your thing, then you wont like this place. However, if you like that scene or at least dont mind it, you'll enjoy. The food was excellent. Id highly recommend the whole snapper - was one of the best fish Ive ever had. We also loved the rice cake appetizer. I found the food decently priced for what we were eating and the area of town we were in. Overall, great experience.",5,LiLOx,New York Area
This is the type of energetic restaurant that makes the Meat Packing District so special. No expense was spared and they did it right.,5,BasaltBob,New York Area
"Expensive for what it is, lack of finger bowl for cleaning hands whilst eating seafood was unpleasant. Lobster ok but had better for the the price",3,Wedgegirl,London
Terrible meal. Be careful not to get stuck in the horrible smelling elevator.,1,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
3rd visit in as many months. Fantastic way to spend an evening with friends. Get the rice balls!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Went in on a recommendation from a friend. Great tapas menu and sushi. Only downfall was thenoiselevel was very high.,4,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
"No doubt, even after the reservation I had to wait about 20 mins at the bar but it was well worth it. I ordered a lobster and hands on it was so good I ate until nothing was left in my plate. Good drink menu but just feel like a HUGE loft with tables.",4,OpenTable Diner,Dallas
"We went to Catch with another couple (four of us total). Food was amazing and gorgeously presented. From the hot pretzel basket with a delish buttery mustard, to the incredible tasting and looking desserts (we wanted to order all of them!) and everything in between, the food was EXCELLENT. The Hamachi appetizer with avocado, cilantro and baby potato chips was soooo good. Little rice cakes with tuna tartare also excellent. We split a ""big fish""(the Black Bass) and also the Branzino. Flavors were out of this world.",5,OpenTable Diner,Charleston
"Outstanding and friendly service, with non-intrusive but excellent suggestions from the waiter lead to a great food experience. We brought foreign guests who are temporary New Yorkers and they had a great time. Located in a great lower Chelsea plaza, with lots of activity around. Part of the adventure is finding your way in. The only caution -- very high noise level, nearly intolerable for dining.",4,ClientAdvisor,Atlanta
Put up the AC higher!!!!! It was so humid in the restaurant,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"NOTHING SPECIAL.. OTHER RESTAURANTS HAVE SIMILAR APPS &amp; ENTREES..TOO NOISY..SLOW SERVING..GAVE ME THE WRONG ENTREE!!! SEATING ALONG WALL IS TOO LOW..BENCH SEATS ARE TOO LOW...THE SERVERS &amp; HOSSTESS ARE VERY NICE &amp; TRY TO ACCOMIDATE, BUT..DIDN'T HELP THE LACK OF FLAVORFUL FOOD. . . SUSHAMI IS GOOD . . SOMETIMES",3,denise1,New York Area
"The food was pretty good but very expensive. The service was just OK, our waitress was a bit stingy with the wine. She also neglected to tell us that there is a full charge for a third of a refill in our wine glasses. We did find the host to be very nice and accommodating though.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"We decided to meet friends near the High Line and Catch was recommended. We loved it! The service was what we love - very friendly, gave suggestions regarding the menu and gave us beer to try since we weren't sure which we wanted. We ordered sushi rolls, excellent mussels and the ""big"" fish that four of us shared. Would absolutely come here again.",5,Ricky,New York Area
I thought the staff had attitude that was not necessary at all!!! Rest was great.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Great food! Menu was excellent. Our server was helpful. Hostesses at front desk were not very friendly.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"An excellent menu if you feel like fish. The Halibut was outstanding, and the Branzino was also a winner. Service was friendly and on the mark; only criticism is that their wine by the glass menu needs work (limited, and too expensive for what they are offering) . All in all, a great place to dine if you want to eat in and then walk around the MPD. You can park on the street if you're careful to observe the signage.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"much better experience than our first time dining at Catch .. though the ""velvet rope"" nonsense at the door still bugs.",3,lostinjerz,New York Area
The Cantonese lobster was fantastic!,5,Roross,New York Area
Food was very good and service excellent. TOO loud. Once it gets crowded the buzz of the chatter is enough. Do you really need to play the music THAT loud...on top of that???? We were screaming at each other across the table.,4,Ellie,New York Area
"def all about the ""scene"" but the food more than holds its own, very good fresh and well prepared food. service, not so much, young, inexp., but food and atmosphere carries it",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Wine list is very overpriced even for Manhattan Sake list is very limited for a restaurant with seafood, sushi and sashimi Service people are very nice, but can be very slow and fall very behind at times which is okay at times but not while waiting for things like coffee, tea or your first drinks Food is okay, but relative to price there is much better within 5 to 10 minutes by taxis Difficult to have a conversation unless you are shouting Not the place to go if one gets tired of overweight nearby white male diners hitting on the waitresses and bragging to their friends about themselves",1,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Exceptional food, excellent service.",5,Janie,New York Area
LOVED THE FOOD amazing fresh seafood,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Food was great, place is very loud tho",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
I plan on returning.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Very good/great food and environment...although the appetizers are significantly better and more imaginative than the entrees. Great atmosphere and the wait staff was very good. The hostesses could have been a little more pleasant and a little less like they were doing us a favor. By about 7:00 it was extremely loud and a huge scene.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"We enjoyed the evening....busy, busy, crowded, but did not have to wait more than 10 minutes to be seated...Service was slow, but the food and presentation was fine.",4,JONZBOI30,San Diego
"Overall not impressed. My boyfriend took me to Catch for my birthday dinner and we both walked out extremely disappointed. Putting aside the $400 bill, the quality of the food was not that good. We had a 7:30 reservation and we were running late so I called them and they said that if we werent there by 7:45 our table would be given away. We actually got there exactly at 7:45 and to our surprise the restaurant was more than half empty. Then they had the nerve to make us wait 15 minutes before we were seated. I heard great things about the restaurant prior to going so maybe we had an off night but will def not be back- there are so many more restaurants in the city that provide better quality food and service for more reasonable prices.",3,Jn1621,New York Area
"It was very good. The ceviche was extraordinary, as were the grilled prawns. Waiters were a little clumsy though.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Gorgeous &amp; understated interiors with incredibly delicious food - fresh, perfectly prepared. If you can ""catch"" a res here, you won't be disappointed. We came in with 7 pp at 5:45 and stayed hours - did not feel as early as I worried. The Zeus cocktail was unique &amp; amazing, as well as the rice cake appetizer &amp; snapper entree with lobster mash. Yum yum yum will be back!!",5,onestylishmama,Las Vegas
Be prepared to have a cocktail or 2 at the bar even if you're on time for your reservation. Nonetheless it's worth the wait. We waited an hour for our table but were rewarded with a round of drinks and a dessert on the house which is unheard of in the MPD. The seafood is fresh and there's such a variety of menu options that your best bet is to order a bunch of selections and share. Service both at the bar and at our table was friendly and consistent. Dessert - to die for. Overall 3 snaps with a twist.,4,Jakeys,New York Area

My Hubby took me there for Mother's Day 5/12. Did not like where we were seated however our server was Excellent!! She was so patient and gracefull... Over all Great service!! He loved his Steam Lobster and our lil ones went crazy for the Steam Mussels we had to order them twice! my king Crab Legs were not steaming Hot ...However overall the meals were fresh and tasty and we all had a great time!,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
there is a world of difference between the staff that mans the phones and the waiting staff. our meal was delicious and the waiter knowledgable and helpful. On the other hand speaking with the people on the phone is not a pleasant experience. I had a 615 reservation on a sunday night. When icalled in the afternoon to make it 15 minutes earlier i was told no changes were allowed because they were fully booked. no logic to this. it was empty when we got there and filled in later. being there earlier would have allowed them to turn the table sooner but the person on phone was not allowed to use common sense. Another time i had made a reservation on the phone and they put it down for their sister restaurant and they would do nothingto accomodat,3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"New scene restaurant.... decent food, a bit pricey, but hey that's the meatpacking district where you come for the views vs the food!",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"If you want to ""be seen"" go here but if there is any part of your being wanting to experience great food - get out of the meat packing district!  Being a ""tv"" chef does not always translate well into the real world and it's very apparent with this culinary venture.  In a city with so many James Beard Award Winning chefs and fabulous restaurants, this flash in the pan overpriced Red Lobster should stick to what Mepaw does best - a bridge and tunnel nightspot.",1,OpenTable Diner,Portland
"Had a celebration dinner at Catch for the first time. Was excellent! Highly recommend, everything we ordered was great.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The food was fantastic at Catch along with it having a great location in the Meatpacking district. The service on the otherhand was horrible, very inexperienced young waitstaff. No recommendations were given on the menu no was there any explanation reagrding some of the dishes. For the amount of money your are spending on a dinner like that you expect much better service.",4,Kriss,New Orleans

"I celebrated my birthday there Tuesday night and couldn’t have been happier! The service was amazing, great music and food! Can’t wait to come back again soon",5,OpenTable Diner,Palm Springs
"A delicious meal, with excellent service. It was Super Bowl Sunday so the restaurant was empty, which meant it was quiet and easy to carry on a conversation. The complimentary warm flatbread with a Boursin-like spread was addictive as was the simple baguette they brought us when we asked for some ""plain bread"". Appetizers were a superb beet and Roquefort salad and a delicious mushroom millefeuille, which was served with a curry sauce that perfectly complemented the mushrooms. Mains were cod and scallops - beautifully prepared and perfectly cooked. We shared a wonderful banana and pineapple tarte tatin. Really a nice evenin, albeit a bit pricey. We will definitely be back.",5,EVFoodie,New York Area

"We had a wonderful brunch at Dirty French. Loved the atmosphere of the restaurant. Instead of a bread basket, they serve a sweet basket consisting of delectable treats like a lemon glazed donut, pecan sticky bun and another pastry. Meal started with the Ahi tuna tartare which was excellent.....Spicy tuna served with an egg crepe. I had the eggs Benedict and my husband had the duck hash. We both devoured our meals as they were simply delicious. Service could have been better but it didn’t ruin the meal. Our waiter was a little out there and I had to ask more than a few times for things we should have been served but not a deal breaker. Will definitely go back.",4,OpenTable Diner,Philadelphia
"I LOVED everything about ""Dirty French"" and so did the rest of our small party. (4 of us)The setting is superb and the food is DELICIOUS with drinks that have that ""extra"" edge, making it ALL very special!! I highly recommend it!!!!!",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I absolutely loved the food, the service was impeccable! Betty",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
The food was delicious!  Au jus sandwich and eggs Benedict were truly awesome. GF bread available and most can be made GF. Warning they offer beautiful donuts/baked treats to the table with no GF alternative.,4,GlutenfreeMom,Philadelphia
"Worst service and staff ever. Walked in, the greeter was not particularly friendly. Made us feel like we were bothering her when we asked to sit away from the door on a cold morning. Ee we’re given the wrong menus. 15  minutes later I waved the water server for water. He told me to wait. Another 10 minutes and th waiter came by. Asked for coffee and the right menus.  No apology. Coffee never came. Man sitting to our left said it’d probably be best if we just left. He’d been waiting for coffee for 15 minutes and the service was awful. It must be the corporate culture. How about training your team to have smiles, be friendly, appear to be happy at work. I don’t get it. We left.",1,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

Pre cooked food for Christmas dinner was a great disappointment.,1,OpenTable Diner,Tampa
Xmas dinner,5,OpenTable Diner,Los Angeles
"We dined at Dirty French for Christmas dinner, and the ambience was fabulous. Our food, however, was less so. Both chicken mains were undercooked/pink and when the waiter cleared the plates, there was no comment. The steak meal was INCINERATED.  Given it was Christmas lunch, the restaurant was busy and service was a little lacking, slow, drinks didn't arrive for ages and needed to be followed up - could do with tightening up.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

"Wonderful staff, beautiful room, terrific food.  A place to have a good time, great food and forget your worries.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Very disappointing.  I was looking forward to taking my out of town friends to Dirty French.  While the food was good, the service was simply awful.  We had a 8pm reservation (and arrived on time), but did not get seated at our table until after 9pm (hostess was at least apologetic - - but that is much too long a wait for a Monday night!).  Our waiter seemed uninterested at best.   Long periods of time would go by where we could not locate him  - - my guests' drinks did not arrive until after our appetizers arrived (and only after we inquired of those that brought out the food).  A restaurant of that caliber (and expense) should have much better service.  On the bright side, food was quite good and the setting is comfortable (particularly the lounge where we stayed while waiting  . . .and waiting . . . and waiting for our table).  In short - - there are much better places to go in this neighborhood.",2,MarkR,San Francisco
It was wonderful and we had an amazing time!  The service was unparalleled and the food was just scrumptious!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"They have 7 entrees and we’re out of 3. On a Friday! They have 6 appetizers and we’re out of 2, on a Friday. So we had 2nd choices for everything, and definitely did not get their best dishes. Quite a shame for a destination dinner.",2,OpenTable Diner,Los Angeles
"Trout and pork chop was amazing. French 75 was great. Stay for after dinner drinks in the hotel lounge in the back. Cozy, fun vibe.",5,OpenTable Diner,Tulsa
"Food was terrific and loved the ambiance btw the cozy lounge, which served well for pre dinner drinks, dining room for dinner, then moved to the romantic and quiet garden for after dinner drink.   Service was consistently appalling. Gentleman at check in barked at me that he doesn't take coats and offered no solution. Later when he escorted us from the lounge to dinner he pointed out coat racks, but didn't offer to take and hang them up. Someone came and plunked down and walked away what turned out to be menus and a wine list on the table, even though we still had half of glass each left.   Server was lovely, but young man came to remove our plates even though we said we were not done. Our server was kind enough to reserve a table for us in the garden &amp; since we weren't escorted, we just sat down where she told us it would be. A new young lady came over and the only comment from her was, ""these tables are reserved."" We said we knew that &amp; it was for us. Beginning to ask her questions about the menu, she said she could not help us, but would get someone. Another lovely young lady arrived and saved the night. A very very disappointing experience, especially given cost.",3,Foodminded2,Chicago
The highlight of my NYC visit and one of the best meals I’ve ever had! Our waitress Pamela made the experience with her passionate and detailed description of each plate: lamb carpaccio and grilled oysters were the standouts followed by the tuna tartare and millefuielle.

"My experience at Catch was memorable. From the moment I walked into the building, I felt welcomed. The staff was incredibly friendly and the transition from the elevator to my seat was quick and easy. Our waitress was very friendly and definitely helped with the recommendation. However, she wasn't around for parts of the experience because she had other tables. There were other staff wondering around and they also helped as well. The food was amazing and I absolutely had an amazing time. The entrees were not as good as the appetizers. I'm just going to order appetizers next time. I absolutely love the place though.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

"Went here on a Friday night for dinner with guests from Europe. Main level bar was very cool. When our table was ready, we were brought upstairs where there was another bar and a fabulous view of the kitchen. My husband got distracted watching the kitchen and he spilled a little of his drink and the hostess made a rude comment to him. The menu had great variety, and the food came out timely. Entree portions were just right sized if you had appetizers to start. We finished with the s'mores pizza which was amazing! Definitely can get pricy, one Bloody Mary was $28, which was a surprise, but it must be the new manhattan prices. Service was excellent save for the hostess and the scene and food was great.",4,OpenTable Diner,New England
"The food was great, especially the red snapper with lobster mash. The server and hostess were also very friendly and knowledgable, though they recommended too many starters for us, which meant we weren't able to order dessert. They were also very quick to clear plates and glasses, which gave us the impression we were on a clock. Maybe best to go on a Wednesday or Thursday when it is less busy. Overall, a good experience though and good value.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Sushi was wonderful!!! We had a lot of different sushi and all was outstanding!!! I can't wait to go back.,4,Lovehiddengems,Chicago
"Thouroghly impressed. I've eaten in a lot of great restaurants around the world, and this was truly a great experience, the flavors were great.  Not the cheapest not the most expensive either!",5,Jlevs,New York Area
Tried the spicy tuna and the grilled salmon entree. Roll was great but the salmon was very salty. I would suggest doing without the sea salt. Server was so nice and helpful. Great drinks but plan to spend some money as they aren't cheap.,5,Jbnyc,New York Area
"Its a nice restaurant but its very expensive. We were a group of 3 an we spent more than 300.00. No many choice of meat If you are looking for a romantic restaurant, this is not what you are looking",4,chefmyrtaperez1423,New York Area
It was beyond our expectations. We really enjoyed every single detail. Congrats.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Food was excellent and definitely unique. Had a reservation and although place was packed we were seated quickly. It was WAY too loud I was celebrating my 2 year wedding anniversary coulndnt even hear. Also I asked for a romantic table and got a 2 top along the edge of the wall. For food and for atmosphere ambiance it's great the rest really needs adjustment,3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
nice place - food and service superb,5,ZJ1122,New York Area
"The NYTimes food critic was right on, writing: ""Catch has its pleasures, but the bill is a cold shower, and when you leave, no one meets your eye. You paid your fare, you got your ride. They are already moving on, to the next wave of high rolle.....You can’t help feeling slightly used."" We try and avoid the meat packing district, although we live a few blocks away in Chelsea. But a dinner companion really wanted to go there. If your quest is to be seen and be in the midst of ""glamor""' this place is for you...while waiting to be seated, a woman in super high heels tripped and fell right in front of us. Now,that glamor!!!! Oh...the food was good, and service was pleasant.",3,Erwin,New York Area
"Went to Catch for my birthday with a group of 5. The basket of pretzel rolls &amp; dijon was a great start. The Mighty Aphrodite was amazing &amp; after a couple of them they certainly snuck up on me!! We ordered to share...the Parmeasan-Truffle fries, Crunchy Rice Cakes (YUM!), Beef Potstickers, Lobster Rolls, Hamachi Tartare, MRC Roll, Hellfire Roll (my favorite), Strawberry Shortcake, Fresh baked cookie bucket and a S'mores Pizza. All the dishes we ordered were so flavorful &amp; incredible! The ambiance was very energetic &amp; they played great music! It was certainly a great way to ring in a new year!",5,OpenTable Diner,Los Angeles
"This week's happening restaurant ... won't seat you until your entire party is present... I'd much rather start my drinking at my table, not in the press of the bar scene. Entree came out before we finished our appitizer.. although I will say our server offered to take it back and have another cooked so we could pace our meal... and we did that. Food was good - I had dover sole with lemon butter and it was delicious. Didn't really feel a reason to ever go back.",3,missmanners,New York Area
Food was very overvrated. Most food came cold. Very posh ambiance. Overpriced. Would not recommend.,2,OpenTable Diner,Orange County
The service has improved since the last time I was there. We all enjoyed our food and had a great time.,4,peggye,New York Area

The food was very good- flavorful. The atmosphere was lively. Will definintely return.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
2nd visit and loved it. Great service and awesome food. I always request a table on the 2nd floor where it's quieter and great for conversation.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
I love this place. It was my second time and i plan on coming here again!!!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Food fine. The place is very nicely decorated. Hostesses clueless. Service slow.. Drinks and wine by glass were not good. Did not have a good experience although the food was good, Won't be back.",2,Nt2209,New York Area
Was there on friday August 17th and it was an AWESOME experience. Food is out of this world. Service is good and the place is very nicely done. This is a MUST visit if you like good food.,5,OpenTable Diner,Montreal
"What an amazing evening! Definitely on the pricey side, but totally worth it. The restaurant is known for its seafood dishes, so to fully experience Catch, try the lobster mac and cheese, the fresh oysters, or the scallop and cauliflower dish. I would avoid dishes like the beef pot stickers. Our server, LeeAnn, was knowledgable and fun; Chauncy the manager was just as charming.The restaurant is great for dates or small groups--definitely not a kids-type restaurant though.  I highly recommend the experience!",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Loved the food...the meal came out too long after the appetizers though. Waiters were nice.,3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Great food and ambiance! Wine selection is awesome. We had a great time overall.,5,Monyvm06,New York Area
Waiter was fabulous but the hostess was incredibly rude.,4,Madal,New York Area
"I heard Catch was good but I had no idea how good it was. It's located on a place that makes me skeptical already, the MeatPacking District. Many places popped opened there for the last years and some of them are just show off places with an OK kitchen. Catch is a total different thing...great crowd, good service and AWESOME FOOD! I had the Red Snapper with Mashed and it was divine!",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Our 8:45 reservation turned into a 9:30 table. I found the 3 different hostesses I dealt with to be somewhat dismissive and insincere. Our server, Chris, saved the day and turned an otherwise negative experience into a positive. However, I will think twi e before returning especially if I am taking guests.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
I didn't love it! I really wanted to - the bar downstairs was wonderful - had a great cucumber infused martini The service was very pleasant - but the food was just fare! Probably just return for a cocktail.,3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"fabulous meal. spectacular setting. great bar area. met friends for a drink. fun specialty cocktails. wonderful service all around. dined in the main dining area. very beautiful. food presented very nicely. all delicious. salads, rolls, ceviche, whole fish, grilled fish, sides. super yummy. great wine list-- not the usual cast of characters. and reasonable choices, too. my new favorite seafood spot in the city. no room for dessert---can't comment. went straight to the highline for a lovely post- dinner stroll. doesn't get any better.",5,Deidz60,New York Area

great food - great service - fun place,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
air condition not working well with summer heat. very uncomfortable and no recognition or apologies!,2,Thaliaf,New York Area
"Normally, I would rave about my experience but currently the A/C is barely working at Catch. Whatever you do don't sit upstairs as between the open kitchen and ventilation problems it's a sweat fest! The host will lie to you and tell you that everything is working normal but ask a server they are trying to find a cool spot like the rest of us.  In all my visits, the wait staff have been outstanding but the host stand is a totally another story.",3,RIONY,New York Area
"Spaghetti bolognese was disappointing as the spaghetti pasta type was too thick and had a weird consistency - it was more Hokkein noodles than spaghetti. Otherwise, overall the food was good.",3,Llll,Dined 3 days ago
"We got to Sauce late for our reservation and  they were able to seat us right away. That was really appreciated. However, the food was just okay. The music and general ambiance is what you would expect for a trendy restaurant on that side of town. I wouldn’t go out of my way to go again though",3,LANYC,New York Area
Delicious! Well paced and fun atmosphere!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Had an easy and pleasant Saturday lunch here. Enjoyed the Gilt City promotion that includes 3 brunch cocktails and an entree per person. The fried egg risotto was mouth watering and the pairing of the cocktails was an amazing add on! The promotion was $39 total for 2 people! Such a great deal for such wonderful food!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Loved the experience and vibe! Will return!,5,OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 3, 2018"
"The bolognese, lasagna and everything really are fantastic but the staff is always in a rush to get you to leave as soon as you're done with your meal which is unpleasant as customers spend money to have a nice evening out and don't want to be pushed around.",5,MariaA,Washington DC
"Too dark, too loud. Arugala Salad was ordinary Mushroom tortoloni was great as was classic pizza",4,amyloidbeta,New York Area
"The food was excellent, and the service was good--after we finally got the host's attention to be seated. The hip-hop soundtrack was awfully assertive for Sunday brunch.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Small portions but good overall,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"This restaurant does not match at all what is on the website. Most of the reviews are correct that the  food is bland. I met friends for lunch along with my daughters. I chose this place because the site looked to be a casual place and didnt have the ""bar"" vibe that many LES places have. I was wrong...they didnt give us the size table we needed. In addition, at 12:30 during the day, it was super dark and they were blaring rap music loaded with curse words. They saw we had small children and not only sat up near a speaker but didnt even have the courtsey of lowering the music, let alone putting on better music. The meatballs were ok but the service was horrible. we had one waitress, never saw her after she took the orders and kept having different people.",2,AngyNYC,New York Area
Waited 50 min for our reserved table. Insane.,2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"We were sat next to a heat-conducting pipe. We sweated to death. We ask to be moved two tables over (which was a two-top, like our table and distanced from the heater) but we were refused on the grounds that a party of five was about to arrive and they would be sat at this table (pushed together with the table next to it). Within 7 minutes after we were told by the hostess that we could not move to that table, a couple was sat there. We were miserable throughout the entire meal. Even though my husband and I pulled off all our layers (my husband went down to his undershirt) we were so overheated and uncomfortable that we lost our appetite and could barely eat. We will not patronize this restaurant again.",2,David,New York Area
I knew it'd be good but it still blew me away just how good!,5,ANNIE,New York Area
"food amazing.  service, one of the beat waitresses weve had in years.  downside is dont get seated in the back room during winter, big time draft. No where to sit or stand if it aiting for the rest of ur party to arrive if bar is full. Other than all this great rest.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Excellent food,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

Great place. Good food,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Great ambience and very attentive service but I’ve had better food...  .. we didn’t hate it but felt if the food was amazing it would have left us very satisfied and super happy as opposed to feeling “It was just ok”.... Some  plates were great while others were just so-so... The lasagna was very good.The  Burratta appetizer was great.  Rigatoni was a tasteless and dry.   We would definitely go back and give it another try...,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Great as always,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Good meatballs.  I enjoyed the steak.   Courses served to close together.  Need to space out more.,4,Alwaysout,New York Area

Fun place to try. Food was good. Vibe was cool. Not sure I would run back though.,3,foodiemom,Miami
food had no taste-*ordered bolognese sauce watery and no taste you think if you name your restaurant Sauce..you make sure all the Sauces are tasty.  white wine served warm,1,nycresipro,New York Area
Great date spot with amazing italian food. Came on the Gilt City voucher and it did not disappoint. The house wine isn't the best but for $89 what do you really expect. Food was outstanding from start to finish!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Great little spot! Pasta was amazing. Interior was cozy.  Would return!,5,OpenTable Diner,Philadelphia
Noise level extremely high. Food only fair.,2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

"Music is a little loud, especially if you're trying to have conversations on a date.",4,Renato,New York Area
"Fries where overcooked. cripsy but dry. Snapper was mediocre, and the lobster mash I can make my self at home. Lobster mac &amp; cheese was just too salty.  I expected more for not just because of price point and repuation, but my home cooked meals taste just as good.",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Tables very close to each other. Good food service.,4,Kara,Las Vegas
The restaurant was very hot and I was expecting it to have more ambiance and maybe background music considering it has become such a hotspot. The food was very good though.,3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Try the mac n cheese, it is delish!  Great drinks!  Dessert was awesome too Loud environment and staff were hustling so service could have been better.",5,OpenTable Diner,Toronto
"The second time around the food was even better than the first and I love the ambience. While I've never brought kids there, I've noticed them, so I would say it's kid-friendly if you're there early. Overall, even though it's on the pricey side and often hard to get a table during primetime, it's a great place to start your evening, so I'd definitely recommend!",4,Ellen,New York Area
Our first time eating here. Overall very good.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"A great all-around restaurant,great food, ambiance was very nice.c Cannot comment on bar scene as we ate very early, although we've heard its a real hot spot.would defiantly go back, and recommend One complaint( my wife says I wrong) But, if you ask for a glass of Pinot noir, shouldn't they mention it's $21.00 per glass? Maybe it's me, otherwise, a great dinner!",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"A.M.A.Z.I.N.G....the lobster mac'n cheese was too die for, the Halibut was amazing, just overall fabulous. Definitely would go back.",5,Jenny2282,New York Area
"The appetizer portion of the menu is outstanding with a lot of creative and well executed dishes. The tuna crispy cakes stands out from the pack. Unbelievable lobster mashed potatoes and the snapper was very good but snapper was only food item that was not outstanding. The desserts all looked great but went with pizza smores as our waiter called them ""out of control"" - which they were! A few criticisms: we did not get the pizza bread noted in othr reviews and there appears to be no specials - which they absolutely should have to keep things exciting and test new items. Waiter noted other Hung ""catch"" locations are being planned. Next time will try scallop and cauliflower entree which won Hung the Top Chef title.",5,OpenTable Diner,Miami
The food and ambiance was great! The restaurant was hot . I'm not sure if the AC was working or if they didn't turn it up.,3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

Great restaurant,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Obviously a place that proves the unfortunate maxim: youth and non-Italians do not provide good Italian food. The hip hop music was loud and jittery. The service was manic. The crowd was Cleveland bowling league. No Italian grandma of any integrity would associate herself with such watery sauce and tasteless meatballs.  But the LES youth and Cleveland ate it up. I’ll pass and tell anyone who cares about good Italian food and not eating at a dimly lit 3rd rate nightclub to sail right by Sauce. I wish I had.,2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Our waiter, Henry, was very helpful. The salads and main courses were excellent. Garlic bread not so.  Noise level (loud recorded music) was annoying. If that is the norm and is appropriate for the age group then we shouldn’t return.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

"They serve very quickly, but the food is great!",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Oh I had such a bad experience at Sauce.  We walked in with very high expectations — the place is just adorable and the menu looked fantastic.  Sadly, the experience left us unhappy.  First, they play very loud hip-hop music - not necessarily a bad thing.  However, we were treated to an onslaught of songs with the F-bomb and the N-word. It was totally inappropriate.  We politely asked if they could turn it down or change the station.  For some reason, this must have offended the server because her demeanor went from “charming” to “downright rude” in about 2 seconds.  In fact, we never saw her again.  We had to flag down other servers and bus boys for the rest of the evening — to clear plates, refill waters, bring silverware, bring a check, etc.....  It was one of the most uncomfortable dinners of my life.",1,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
"Literally love this place, the energy, decor, and the FOOD is something else. :) Came here to celebrate a special night with friends and had a blast. Food came out really fast too!",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Very good pasta and steak. Quick and efficient service. Music was way too loud and our request to turn it down was not heeded. We couldn’t hear each other so we ate one quick course and left.,2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Very good food.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Arrived late but was still courteously accommodated.  AWESOME food and very reasonably priced.  I will be coming back for more!,5,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
"Our reservations were for 11pm, we were seated at 11:40pm. The table was constantly bombarded with wait staff moving around chairs and delivering food. Changing our table helped and about 45 minutes the place thinned out a bit. Mahi Mahi just okay. Lobster mash very good. Would not hurry back.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Dining at Catch was an experience that I'll never forget! The flavors, the sauces just everything was amazingly delicious!!! I will absolutely return &amp; I have already recommended this restaurant to friends &amp; family. Catch will see me again on my birthday!!",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"We went for an early dinner after work (6:00) so we didn't get a taste of what the scene/ambiance is like, but we were EXTREMELY impressed with the food. The complementary soft pretzels were to die for! Wine was on the expensive side but overall we had a great time. I would highly recommend this spot.",5,SarahRNC,New York Area
expensive but worth it great scene and crowded with beautiful people,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
This Top Chef restaurant was a real disappointment. Signature lobster mac and cheese was greasy. Other dishes lackluster.,2,NinaK,New York Area
"The place was wonderful. Great food and great vibe. The only thing was bad was that we saw a mouse run by our table on the dining room floor. When we approached the manager about this, he did nothing to make us feel better about the food we just ate and paid for. He did nothing about the rat, pretended like it didn't happen as if we lied about the incident. Besides that the service from the waiters was really good, they made us feeler warmed and welcomed.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Overall very good. Very Very expensive! Now that I tried it because I heard so much aboutbit, not sure I would go back. Too crowded,tables too close to one and other , very loud!",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Amazing! The food is absolutely divine. Catch is one of the best places I've ever gone to and I've dined at the best all over the world. Congrats to the chef and his team for creating a unique and fabulous meal....the dishes were all wonderful.,5,Chappaqua8,New York Area
"Appetizers much better than the main courses. Service is sloppy at best. We went with another couple and they got their order wrong and by the time they brought out the correct order, we were finished with our meals. And this was on Sunday when we were one of the few in the restaurant at the time. We had to keep flagging down our waiter, even to get the check. Definitely need to tighten up the lackluster service. There are too many other choices in this area now.",3,diner4ever,New York Area
"Upon arrival we were barely greeted. The hostess took us to our table, but we didn't like it because it was blocked by a wall on one side and backing into a column/ beam. She didn't even wait for us to be seated, she laid the menu on the table and walked away. So we had to get her attention from across the room to express that we wanted seat at a different table, she didn't bother coming back to tell us where, we took it upon ourselves to seat at a table by the window.  It took the waiter forever to come to our table to take our drink orders. Once we placed our order we saw him 2 more times...one to ask if we needed more drinks, the other to give us the check. The check suggested at a minimum of18%, we gave him15% and that was generous",1,OpenTable Diner,Washington DC
"My husband and I took our 6 year old daughter on a Saturday night, and not sure how we would be greeted. The staff could not be nicer!!! They made her cucumber and rice sushi rolls with soy paper, and spaghetti. Our meal was delicious, and we will definitely be back.",5,Sharri,Atlantic City
Started with sushi which was fresh and creative. The hot appetizer that we got was the crispy shrimp which were perfectly fried shrimp in a spicy mayo type of sauce. We also got the lobster Mac and cheese which was the best that I have gotten out at a restaurant. They weren't cheap with the lobster the way STK is and it also was one third of the price of STK without the wateryness. The main course we split the lobster Cantonese which gave generous amounts of lobster along with the Parmesan truffle fries and lobster mashed potatoes. The lobster mashed potatoes were another delicious lobster item they had on the menu that contained generous chunks of lobster in a creamy and lumpy bowl of mashed potatoes. All in all great dining experience,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
A place to enjoy. it surprised us with its culinary creations. Great service and ambiance,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I was really looking forward to trying Catch and left just feeling ""ok"" about the experience. There are definitely some great food options, the ambiance and service were great, but I just didn't leave feeling ""wowed"" by what I had eaten. We had a party of 4 and we all shared, so we got to try a good portion of the menu. I wouldn't argue if someone wanted to take me there again, but I definitely won't be running back on my own anytime soon.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Catch is a catch. Great food, happening place, good drinks and did I say great food? To top it off the prices were reasonable compared to other trendy spots. We will definitely be back.",5,JohnnyB,New York Area
"excellent tasting food - the rolls were fantastic with a wonderful combination of flavours. The sauted snapper was perfectly cooked. Flavours of the fish combined great with the lobster mash and brown butter - compliment to the chef. The chocolate pizza with the mashmallow initially sounded a bit crazy, but it came with great tastes and good textures. Food overall fair priced, wines comparably expensive. Friendly and attentive service.",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago

The food and service was impeccable! Loved it so much!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Very large restaurant over two levels...a bit impersonal. Food was definitely better than expected.,3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The food was delectable, the service great, the energy high. My only negative is the noise level was so high that I even found it hard to hear our waitress' descriptive menu recommendations. I also had trouble hearing my friends right across the table however, due to the closeness of the tables the party next to us drowned out my friends with their extremely LOUD voices. I could hear their conversation better than our own!",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
the place to go in NYC,5,FogoFan,San Diego
another make you wait forever meat packing district restaurant. We waited almost 45 minutes for a table and many were open when we sat. Food was good but not worth the wait. Would not go back.,2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Sushi is WONDERFUL!,4,Lovehiddengems,Chicago
"Catch used to be great, but not this time. Waiter was had the energy level of a dead cat, the table was ""blah"", they gave us no preference for access to the lounge, which would be fine until I saw who they were giving preference: groups of women (I get that) but the men were dressed like construction workers just off their shift.  Don't get me wrong, I would like the all inclusive nature of their door policy if it were such, but it wasn't. That and the guy at the door was too ridiculous to take his cherry-picking people seriously.  It's kind of expensive and annoying to put up with this much for good mac and cheese with lobster.",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Was not too impress with the food...I was not expecting diner size serving but for the price the restaurant charges, they can be a little mor egenerous on the potions...least price on the fish entree was $26...will be awhile before I come back...",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

"We had a birthday dinner there on a Sunday evening and everything was perfect. After reading the other reviews, I expected a good time, but was also prepared for some MPD 'tude -- which we (thankfully) never received! Everything we had was delish, and we especially enjoyed the whole snapper (enough for 3 or 4 to share) and the green beans. Hot apple pie for dessert was amazing and we crawled out of the restaurant stuffed and happy! I highly recommend for couples or groups. A great time!",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"We had a lovely dinner at Catch. After a dozen raw oysters, my husband and I had the whole fish with garlic sauce, which was perfectly done (not overcooked which is often a problem), with snap peas (wonderfuly crispy) and lobster mashed potatoes. Service was friendly and very attentive. The place had a happy buzz going on, but it wasn't so loud you couldn't hear your dining companion speak. We loved it and will be back next time we are in NY.",4,BaltimoreSharon,Baltimore
Would recommend &amp; will be back...,5,pato,New York Area
"This started out as a good dinner and ended up,as Great! The menu did not wow me but the choices were adequate. We tried a roll and a couple small plates, signature cocktails and simple fish entrees. The roll was excellent and got me excited for each following dish. We asked for our simple fish blackened and were told ok but when it came there was no spice in sight however the fish was very good, just the way they served it. Everything became outstanding when dessert showed up. Don't usually order dessert but figured we had to try and it was awesome. Before the meal was over we were touring the restaurant, with the very attentive manager, for group dining settings and I had already picked out my next meal there! Bravo!",4,313dine,New York Area
"We received a 545pm booking on a Friday at short notice which was lucky as we were visiting for a short time. We were not rushed in any way to finish our meal. Food was excellent. Sashimi, Clam bake, lobster macaroni and cheese were all exceptional. Only disappointment was the wine chosen with the meal was served in a very small glass and less than half-filled. For such an expensive place I cannot understand why they would try and skimp like this when our total outlay for two people including the tip was $300. It left a bad impression unfortunately.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Catch has a great menu for sharing. The Dover Sole dinner special was amazing. Save room for dessert! I recommend the S'mores Pizza or the Peanut Butter Cup Souffle.,5,KDF21,New York Area
"We had to wait 55 min for our table. Not ok. We talked to 5 different staff-girls and boys and not until we said that we were leaving, we got a table.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The place is a great scene to be a part of. The food is good, but slightly overrated. Asian fusion needs more wide selection of options however the lobster mac and cheese is a great choice, red snapper has great meat, branzino is not worth ordering. Rock shrimp appetizer w/ mayo has a nice kick to it. Ordered the French Chablis white wine - it was great. Waitstaff is a bit too business-oriented and table turnover-focused - it is too obvious. Learn to relax New Yorkers - you will get more business long-term that way, I am a New Yorker too, but originally from Europe (thank God!). I'd come back just to make a little, quick impression, but not just for the food. I'd go nearby to Buddakan for better Asian fusion. Very beautiful staff though!!!",3,Timerius,New York Area
"Loud, over priced and bad service. Would not go back.",2,DennisO,New England
"We had a reservation at 11.30pm and arrived on time, but the bouncer made us wait for more than 15 minutes. When we got upstairs the hostess dare to tell me that because we were late our table was not ready...we were late because of the bouncer... Food good but lots of garlic. Prices are ok. After paying a huge bill they did not let us go to the bar upstairs.",3,Carlos,New York Area
A very special trendy restaurant in the heart of the Meatpacking district. Like coming out of Vogue.,5,AShley,New York Area

Absoutely one of the best seafood restaurants I have ever eaten at. The appetizers and main courses are all incredible. This was a business dinner and it was really good. The waiter was very good - the busboy needs a little more training. But overall good service. Try the Mahi Mahi - very fresh and a very good presentation.,4,CharlesB,New York Area
"Food is good and the crowd is beautiful! If you´re looking for the best fish place in town, this might not be your place. The food is great, but by no means outstanding. But still very good and therefore fit for foodies. Don't get the surf and turf...first of all way too much for just one person and the steak is soso. The Lobster on the other hand is very good.  This is a place you go to for the glamour factor, the beautiful people, the in-crowd, the people watching etc. A nice side effect is the good food. So if you want to have a fun night, go for it...this is your place. If you want to leave a restaurant and crave about the food for the next weeks you probably will want a different location.  I definitely will be back!",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Too many empty tables even though when you try to book it says it booked and no resos the time you need it. They lie about resos. Not cool!,3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"This place was great!  Quiet, but we did go on a tuesday night, right after Labor Day weekend.  Everything we had was really good except for one dish which we sent back with no dramas.  We heard it was the new hot spot, but maybe next time we'll try it on a weekend!",4,OpenTable Diner,Denver
"I made a reservation for 3 people, for dinner on Friday morning for Saturday at 9:15 on OpenTable. Great experience so far! On the day off, we ended up being 4 so we arrived at 8:35 to make sure to be able to add one person without a problem. The pretty faced blonde at the ""door"", after telling me  what beautiful name I had, told me ""absolutely no problem just let me know when you are all here and I will sit you"". My party was complete at 9:00 so I told her that we were ready. She told me ""I'll get you seated in 5 min."" First of many lies. After asking her twice more and after getting the same answer (""the next one will be you"") we decided to leave at 9.50 after she told us ""I'll sit you in 2/3min for the 3rd time"".",1,Pipposplaces,New York Area

"Overall a very good night. Front of house were a bit stressed at the start of the night and much more relaxed at the end. Table service was outstanding. Why can't you start a tab in the bar and carry it through to the restaurant, what's that all about?",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

"I found the place according to reviews, and it was beyond my expectations. The service was great, I booked a table for 2 for a friend that came to visit from out of town and for me, but we were 6 at the end since other friends want to join.   The host was so lovely, and we were told that we get the table for 6! The food was delicious, and the cocktails were excellent.  I'll be back for sure.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Service was excellent. Host was accommodating and friendly. However, the layout of the restaurant is odd. Tables are arranged too close to the restroom. The food was ok. Rice ball was lukewarm. Cacio e Pepe was salty and oily.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Too much average quality - pasta over cooked and not flavor some,2,OpenTable Diner,London
The food was authentic and amazing! The staff was friendly and attentive. We will he back...the antipasto is simply to die for. 😊,5,LTT1,Raleigh
"What a great evening! The fun and charming ambience, the food, the service were terrific. Everyone we came in contact with that was associated with the restaurant was super friendly and so eager to make sure our evening was enjoyable. Everyone truly went our of their way. The pastas and fish we had were very good as was the watermelon salad. The desserts we ordered were outstanding. After dinner we went downstairs to the bar and had a fun time. A very memorable evening for all of us and we can't wait to return !",5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"We order the octopus,  Cacio Pepe,  and the mushroom pizza.  The food was good.  Pizza was a bit over priced for the size.   Service was slow,  not so attentive.  We had to ask for our water to be refilled.  They did not check if we needed anything else or if anything was alright.  We sat waiting to wave down someone to pay our bill.  They had the Halloween theme going on right now.. not so much a fan.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Small restaurant with interesting menu. My kind of place. Family run with great food, good service. Decent wine options.",5,CarrieLou,San Francisco
Myself and a couple girlfriends tried this place out for late night dining. The food was great although it seemed only Italian (we thought it would be an Asian fusion restaurant). The place was extremely loud and towards the later part of our meal the bar became really crowded and it seemed the wait staff forgot about us. We were waiting so long that we decided not to order dessert although we initially wanted to.  It's not a restaurant for conversation but it was a fun vibe if you want to party.,3,KitR,New York Area
Truly fell in love with their house made mozzarella. Devoured the whole pizza and a pasta between two girls Will definitely come again for their truffle pizza 😍🙏🏻,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I wish I was informed that there was a large party at a tiny place...we waited 40min to be seated, which was a very cramped and uncomfortable table. The large party of 8 took the whole restaurant and was extremely loud. Terrible situation for a date; We basically had to yell the whole time. We were so hungry from waiting we just wanted to get out of there as soon as possible. This is not acceptable. When a restaurant is tiny, it should let the other guests know of any large parties that can damage their experience. The food and service was great. No bad comments there. I eat out pretty much every night , and I never been in a situation I can't enjoy my meal like happened tonight.",2,Jeweats,New York Area
"Pasta was amazing and my husband had the steak, also delicious.",5,OpenTable Diner,Houston
Pretty good food at reasonable prices. The uni tagiatelle is delightful but a little on the pricey side. The octopus is good but the vegetables and dressing it's served with don't pair the best. The service was good until it got busy at the end and the waiter repeatedly forgot about us. It took half an hour for our party of two to get the check then have it returned.,4,OpenTable Diner,Miami
"La comida es extraordinaria. El tuétano (marrow) para mi una excelente entrada. Las pastas en general mi y buenas con trucha, con erizo, frutti di mare.  He regresado 3 veces y lo volvería a hacer.",4,Luistri,México

Amazing food. Great ambience -- but: noise level was insane... we could hardly hear each other. Might be a reason not to come back.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I was looking for a last minute reservation at a restaurant with really good food.  Luckily, Louie and Chan had a reservation slot open.  Not only is the food, delicious, but the Happy Hour is a great deal!  The bone marrow was AMAZING, I've been craving it since we finished it.  I also had the cacio e pepe,  which is one of my favorite dishes, and as a result, I am normally critical of it.  They executed it well! We also had a salad with arugula and artichokes, it was tasty, and light.   The dining room is small, but there didn't seem to be a wait the entire time, and people moved in and out at a comfortable speed.    Will return for another meal and/or happy hour.",5,FoodieandWineo,New York Area
"Been here several times over the past year. Food was great, as per usual. The drinks, however, seemed to be a bit off as opposed to previous meals here. Also, there was a large table of children, making a great deal of noise. Not the most appropriate place for children IMO. Ruined the ambiance a bit.   However the food continues to be excellent and the service fantastic.",4,Jwwhite10,New York Area
Phenomenal time!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Louis &amp; Chan's has been the first place that I visit every time I visit New York. It is consistently well prepared food, in a comfortable, relaxed space, which puts me at ease after my travel to the city. Not only do the Food and ambiance of the restaurant keep me coming back but the Staff are always upbeat and cheerful. witch is contagious. You guys are great! Keep it up.",4,OpenTable Diner,Washington DC
"Went to Louie and chan on a Friday night just to meet up with a old friend and grab some good food. Had a reservation at 10:45pm but wasn't seated until 11:20pm. It's a pretty small, intimate spot so it was expected to not be seated right away, but was also hungry so was getting ready to leave until the host offered us a free glass of prosecco (wahoo).  After our table was ready, our waiter apologized a few times for the wait, and they were really attentive to serving my table.   The pasta and pizza we ordered was delicious (can't remember what exactly) but I will definitely be visiting again soon!",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Came here for dinner, ordered food and no alcohol. Felt ignored by staff because they checked up more on other patrons around us who ordered alcohol. Waited over 30 minutes for main course. Food is okay, but certainly far from the good ones I've had (Michelin stars). Very very loud, music selection is horrible.",2,GinL,New York Area
"My now husband and I went to Louie and Chan on our second date and we now travel 45 minutes into the city from the burbs to enjoy a date night there whenever we can.  That's how good it is! The food is always excellent and incentive, the ambiance is charming and the service is always wonderful.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

My 3rd time back to this restaurant and unfortunately food wasn't as good as it used to be...not sure what happened?,2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I think the food and service was terrific but they have a HUGE draft problem with the front door. We sat at a table 4 feet from the front door..which opened every two minutes with people coming in and out. It was a freezing cold night, so we got very cold. Two of my guests sat with their coats on all night. Unacceptable! They have to fashion a velvet drape or something at the door to stop the draft. OR don't have a table there. Bad planning. It's too bad to, because the cold air ruined the meal.",2,Rusty123,New York Area
"Great neighborhood restaurant.  Excellent food.  Attentive waiter.  Nice atmosphere.  Wood fired stuffed sardine was well prepared, Louie's salad was a great combination of veggies with a very tasty dressing, delicious mushroom risotto (with a veggie base),  fusilli alla caprese was amazing.  Eat here!",5,Lovetocookandeat,New York Area
"This place was just okay for dinner with friends on a Saturday night. We had a 930 reservation and weren't seated til 1015, and then it was freezing sitting by the door. We did eventually move to a new table at 11pm, but imagine earlier in the night would not be an option as this place is incredibly small.  On the bright side, the staff was very nice and attentive, and the food was hit or miss. But I probably wouldn't go back.",3,LexieG,New York Area

"Would have given 5 stars but for some reason there wasn't a trace of any type of air conditioner present. Night would have been more enjoyable if it wasn't 95 degrees inside the restaurant. Overall , great place, burratta was amazing , pizza was great and desserts were off the charts. Would go back if they rectify the air conditioner issue.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Salad and pasta way too salty! Awful awful food. Could have easily died from the sodium intake.  Good service and good music they play there.,1,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The food was very very good and the setting was great because we were the only people in there except for a few at the bar. The mixology drinks were delicious as well. The service was terrible! Not the kitchen, the service! Our food came out quickly and was prepared fantastically... but the waiter was horrific. He was rude, (attempted to be) condescending, and extremely unpleasant. The worst part was, he was treating us as if we were a waste of his time and we were the ONLY table in there. And, to make matters worse, we racked up a $300 bill and he was acting as if we were in there asking for water and free bread! All 4 of us there have been waiters and waitresses so we were kind enough to leave him a 17 percent tip.... he deserved maybe a 5 percent tip. I won't be returning based on the service alone.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

I mentioned that we were celebrating a friend who has survived cancer and the restaurant staff completely took care of us. They provided a glass of complimentary champagne and a shared dessert. I was positively shocked. I was just hoping for a better table :)  They exceeded my expectations and I will definitely add it to my regular steakhouse rotation.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

"We celebrated my wife's birthday and had such an incredible meal/experience.  The food was phenomenal, service exceptional and Devone (Manager) went out of his way to make us feel welcome and appreciated.  The steaks were cooked perfectly and the duck lasagna and ricotta appetizer was crazy good.  We can't wait to go back again!!!",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Crowded Saturday night. Despite having a 9pm reservation, we weren't seated until 9:45. The staff was pleasant but I was surprised they didn't offer a complimentary drink while we waited or something for being so late. We did ask for a free drink to the manager who agreed but I was surprised this level of restaurant I needed to ask for something rather than be offered automatically.  Additionally, it is strange a fine restaurant doesn't know how to time it's reservations properly after being open for a while.  The food was very good and well priced for the quality offered. I would return but NEVER on a weekend!",3,SelectiveFoodie,New York Area

"Overall - everything was very pleasurable.  We took ricotta,  Foie Gras, hand cut steak tartare,   tomahawk and t-bone steaks.  The steaks were done perfectly.  Wines were perfect match to the steaks, thank you sommelier for the great suggestions.  However, the tartare and side dishes were over salted, some of the sides were simply over burned (mushroom, and broccolini were not edible at all).  That's why I rated 3 stars only.  Service was very pleasant and professional, atmosphere in the restaurant is very warm.  We are glad we had our event here.",4,GalinaY,New York Area
Food is great. A real NYC experience.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Perhaps it is the NY steakhouse that is dead - then again maybe it’s just Bowery Meat Market that is DOA...  I suppose that all restaurants in New York have been reduced to the same - get them in, give them the check- model, maybe it’s wrong to single out this one. But it was my brother’s 30th birthday tonight. We ordered cocktails - only one came on time. We had to cancel the other 3 to accommodate the wine we ordered. Appetizers - only one of three arrived on time. Then two bottles of wine - the 2nd took 25 minutes to come to the table. Only 2 of 4 main plates arrived on time. Then the desert, was the saddest scoop of ice cream I have ever seen, and an underdressed strawberry cheesecake. The price tag - 480$ for 4, and sub par service.... pick another steakhouse..",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Thursday night dinner packed and very noisy.  You have to shout to have a conversation. Understafed for the crowd.   Ambience is reminiscent of 1955-63 mad men era decor. Panel wood abound, lighting, curtains and mirrors all of the circa design. Well done!  Food unfortunately was sub par. 3 in our party, ordering a bone in ribeye (very fatty beyond normal and not tasty), tender filet (dry and plain) and a delicious sirloin cooked at a good temperature . Sides were fried brussel sprouts that was like eating charcoal, cream spinach swimming in butter and good french fries. Did not bother to have dessert.    Oveall attractive ambience, loud, over priced with food below a quality steak house norm.",2,EpicureanXP,Hong Kong

"Great meal!  Was disappointed we didn’t receive the mini arancini as an amuse like everyone else seemed to.  Also had to had for bread.  Other than those two issues, it was really nice.  Probably couldn’t go wrong with any item on the menu.  The broiled oysters were outrageous!  The squash appetizer was unique and the combination of flavors and texture was a great feeling in my mouth.",4,Blondie,New York Area
I loved it and it’s great for groups however in our group 2 were vegetarian so they have no problem eating with meat lovers but your menu has no options  One of us had to ask for plain pasta with olive oil and was charged a ridiculous price - she did not eat fish either maybe in these times when more and more people are becoming vegetarian you should add a little more option - it makes business sense surely to cater for all Otherwise we all loved it but overpriced plain pasta!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
My husband and I enjoyed a wonderful anniversary here! Everything from food to service was top notch. Pricey but well worth it.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Somehow, every year our anniversary dinner is at a steakhouse. The last two years were Delmonico's, so this year I chose Bowery Meat Company for our 24th wedding anniversary.  The place is loud and packed. Still, we were quickly acknowledged and seated at a small corner two-top. We ordered water, and then some beer along with our meals.  We started with an amuse bouche of small cheese arancini, which were OK. Then I had the chicken liver and foie gras parfait, which was a nice thick slice of paté served with a small frisée salad and brioche toast points. Yum! Hubby had the baked oysters, which were rich with butter, garlic, and breadcrumbs.  Then, for our anniversary, the kitchen sent out two mini dishes of the famous Duck Lasagna. Let's just say that this is what we will get next time! The rich sauce of duck jus with tomato reduction, along with a stronger cheese, thin duck slices, and perfect sheet pasta was just wonderful. I was getting full and ate the whole serving!  Then entrées - lamb rib for me - two nice double-rib chops grilled perfectly rare with a cucumber yogurt sauce, and hanger steak for hubby that was topped with fried onions. For sides we had the roasted brussel sprouts, sautéed mushrooms, and the sour cream and onion hash brown (a large latke covered with soft onions, sour cream, and green onion. Portions were huge, and we brought home enough for a full meal.  The two small toffee ice cream balls that came with our check were overly sweet and too rich.  Other thoughts - They need some less rich desserts. While a deconstructed s'more with marshmallow ice cream, or a pudding-filled chocolate chip cookie with ice cream, is generally right up my alley, not so much after a high fat and high flavor meal. How about a fruit tart? Or a sorbet trio?  The space is super-loud, and several tables of tipsy and large white boys in suits managed to shout over the music. They only stopped when they were eating!",5,LyndaLippin,New York Area
"Food was amazing as usual, the steaks were perfectly cooked and the thin chips are crispy just the way I like it. All the staff were second to none, they were polite and made sure we was satisfied. My wife booked this for my birthday and it truly made the evening",5,OpenTable Diner,Birmingham

"The Tomahawk steak was excellent (cooked Medium Rare).  Other recommendations include ricotta spread, brussel sprouts, and ribeye.",5,ngs206,New York Area
"In my experience as a foodie I have never experienced the level of  service that you receive at the BMC.  This venue uplifts the NYC steakhouse scenery by bringing it to the casual  and vivrant style of conteporary ambiace coupled with unique flavors, crafted cocktails, and a sofisticated wine list. As vivrant as it is it does not fail to satisfy complex and sophisticated palates and demanding clients that expect nothing less than unforgettable service.",5,Wowbque,Palm Springs
"All in all, I had a wonderful experience at Bowery Meat Company. The service was outstanding. Our waiter was very helpful in recommending ""fan favorites"" from the menu, as well as options that would suit our personal tastes. The food was out of this world: lots of unique cuisine and options beyond the typical offerings of most steakhouses. Lastly, the ambiance of the restaurant was a nice balance of soothing, yet lively.",5,ScatAutotune,Greensboro
"I suppose it's not fair to bemoan the loss of the East Village of my youth, but there is a decided millennial and millennial wannabe vibe here. Loud, a bit pretentious (parading around the raw cuts of meat is an exercise in excess and not a little insalubrious), and somewhat superficial. Sides were actually quite good. Solid salads, decent shrimp cocktail, great parker house-esque rolls. Our steak, requested as rare to medium rare, arrived solidly medium, but we thought of having to grapple with our out of touch waiter and wait longer for our food so sucked it up. Good but not great. Sommelier very knowledgeable and concurred with our choice of an amazing Jura pinot. Sadly, there are too many joints in town to make this one a repeat.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Excellent! Chef/Owner clearly has a deep respect for his restaurant, his ingredients and his customers. Food quality, presentation and creativity were superb.  Not your father’s steakhouse.",5,Spinalis,Kansas City

"I found the restaurant extremely expensive compared what I have eaten (3/4 items) choosen in between raw fodd and sashimi. I walked out with a check , including tip, over 340 dollars. I have been at Catch twice in the last 2 months , and in both cases I made reservation before , and I have been seated regularly after 30/45 minutes than I supposed to be seated and where the same hostess was totally rude instead to be nice , like was my fault the delay form the organization. I would'nt never experience again a dinner there if they dont change something in management and reviewing prices.",3,OpenTable Diner,San Diego

I have been twice &amp; the main courses are better than the appetizers by far. The smores pizza was fabulous,4,OpenTable Diner,Miami
"LOVE it, my new fav in NY. Love the bar after dinner.",5,OpenTable Diner,Sydney / NSW
great scene but wish they had more gluten free options,3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Food was good but had a very bad table,3,Bart,Miami
"While the Waiter was very nice, The tall and skinny hostess who manages the comupter leaves much to be desired-rude and annoying. They could greatly benefit from classes in ""just being civil"" ....Decent food, nothing to write home about. People should not confuse the hot new thing with long term sustainability.",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Food is always good and wait service is always prompt. However, I have consistently felt the host and hostess staff are extremely rude and demeaning. They are impatient, inconsiderate, and extremely cold. They refuse to make eye contact and speak in a condescending manner. I thoroughly enjoy the food and the atmosphere, but having to deal with the terrible service when you first walk in is almost enough to make you want to avoid the restaurant all together.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Restaurant was NOT easy to find. The address is on 9th Ave. , but the restaurant is on a side street and UPSTAIRS. We had to do some digging to find it. However, the hunt was worth it. The food was delicious,try the scallop entre that the chef won an award for, yumm! Expensive, however, as everything is a la cart and it's difficult to not want to try new things. Would definitely try again.",5,OpenTable Diner,Central Coast
Definitely a big fan of Catch. My sister and I went and loved all of the appetizers that we got (we got a bunch of them and shared for our meals). The seafood was all fresh and delicious and the place is really fun and a cool spot to be at for right now so I've been back and will continue to go since I like their lounge as well.,3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"We went at 5:30pm (pre-theater), so I am not sure what it's like at 9pm, but it was excellent -- the food and the waitstaff.",5,EarlyLBI,New York Area

"Arrived late in the night. Table was ready, menu was discussed in its entirity. Service was perfect, food was good, great for a datenight, light eats, and some ppl watching",4,OpenTable Diner,Miami
"A very good surprise ! The decor is trendy, the service young and friendly ,may be a little bit to quick (the bill arrived before we have asked for it),and the food very good. The fish either raw or cooked was perfectly fresh and the creamy rice with vegetables a delight. Definitively a place to go back to.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"We had a great time BUT we felt really rushed!All 6 appetizers were served at the same time, the plates were picked up while we were still chewing the last bite, immediately thereafter they have us the dessert menu, served it and yet again, while still chewing, they cleaned up and handed us the check. We celebrated my husbands b'day and I was dissapointed that the overall experience wasn't relaxed and festive but more like a fast food one...",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Definitely one of the most delicious meals I have eaten in a long time. Can't wait to return!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"This restaurant was nothing short of fabulous! Server was great and made it clear that he wanted us to be happy. I couldn't decide on the martini I wanted , server suggested one and then said if I didn't like it I could choose another, no problem. Great food, service and an overall great experience.",5,boahmoran,Detroit
Amazing restaurant but heavy wait staff presence made dining experience feel a bit rushed. Too many waiters coming to our table too often to either bother us to see if we were finished or clear plates that we were still working on,4,Foodielove,New York Area
LOVED!!!! Mushroom spaghetti is to die for.,5,CliffP,New York Area
"Always a great spot, A bit noisier than usual this time, but still great.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"always a fantastic time, very fresh fish which is always a treat. Fun and energetic as well, we finished the night at the rooftop bar, quite a cool scene.",4,DavidDinesOut,New York Area
"The atmosphere makes this place good for a special occasion and a hot spot.  The service was very bad - and i don't say that lightly.    First off, I had a reservation for a birthday on a Monday night and they didn't seat us for 45 minutes - and we made it known it was for a special occation.  Then, once seated, the servers were very confused: one server would lay out silverwear, and minutes later another server would take the silverwear away.  They did this at least 3 times.    Service aside, the food was delicious and it was a great atmosphere.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Meatpacking hot spot if you are looking for something lively. Best dishes: The Catch Roll, hamachi tartare &amp; the tuna crunchy rice cakes",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

Fantastic food. We really enjoyed our experience &amp; the overall feel of the meat packing district. We look forward to visiting Catch again when we get to return to NYC.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I was disappointed. The food was decent, but the service wasn't up to par. Overpriced.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Dinner, in my view should be at least a two hour proposition, with time to savor your food and company. As long as you don't mind being rushed along from appetizer through dessert in an hour and fifteen minutes, then everything else about Catch is fabulous.",4,jatwom,New York Area
"Food was perfect, restaurant was a little dark for people with worse/older eyes.   5/5 will come back very soon",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"I celebrated my birthday there Tuesday night and couldn’t have been happier! The service was amazing, great music and food! Can’t wait to come back again soon",5,OpenTable Diner,Palm Springs
"A delicious meal, with excellent service. It was Super Bowl Sunday so the restaurant was empty, which meant it was quiet and easy to carry on a conversation. The complimentary warm flatbread with a Boursin-like spread was addictive as was the simple baguette they brought us when we asked for some ""plain bread"". Appetizers were a superb beet and Roquefort salad and a delicious mushroom millefeuille, which was served with a curry sauce that perfectly complemented the mushrooms. Mains were cod and scallops - beautifully prepared and perfectly cooked. We shared a wonderful banana and pineapple tarte tatin. Really a nice evenin, albeit a bit pricey. We will definitely be back.",5,EVFoodie,New York Area

I love Dirty French! The food is fantastic. 80s music 24/7. Great decor. The staff is fantastic. Being there makes me happy!,5,BretteGoldstein,New York Area
"We had a wonderful brunch at Dirty French. Loved the atmosphere of the restaurant. Instead of a bread basket, they serve a sweet basket consisting of delectable treats like a lemon glazed donut, pecan sticky bun and another pastry. Meal started with the Ahi tuna tartare which was excellent.....Spicy tuna served with an egg crepe. I had the eggs Benedict and my husband had the duck hash. We both devoured our meals as they were simply delicious. Service could have been better but it didn’t ruin the meal. Our waiter was a little out there and I had to ask more than a few times for things we should have been served but not a deal breaker. Will definitely go back.",4,OpenTable Diner,Philadelphia
"I LOVED everything about ""Dirty French"" and so did the rest of our small party. (4 of us)The setting is superb and the food is DELICIOUS with drinks that have that ""extra"" edge, making it ALL very special!! I highly recommend it!!!!!",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I absolutely loved the food, the service was impeccable! Betty",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
The food was delicious!  Au jus sandwich and eggs Benedict were truly awesome. GF bread available and most can be made GF. Warning they offer beautiful donuts/baked treats to the table with no GF alternative.,4,GlutenfreeMom,Philadelphia
"Worst service and staff ever. Walked in, the greeter was not particularly friendly. Made us feel like we were bothering her when we asked to sit away from the door on a cold morning. Ee we’re given the wrong menus. 15  minutes later I waved the water server for water. He told me to wait. Another 10 minutes and th waiter came by. Asked for coffee and the right menus.  No apology. Coffee never came. Man sitting to our left said it’d probably be best if we just left. He’d been waiting for coffee for 15 minutes and the service was awful. It must be the corporate culture. How about training your team to have smiles, be friendly, appear to be happy at work. I don’t get it. We left.",1,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Amazing food!! One of the best places ever!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

"Avoid New Year’s Eve.  Difficult evening.  Set menu.  All food came out cold and ltd waitstaff made it tough. Not in the mood to complain on NYE, so...just didn’t eat much of anything,  Too bad.  Usually like Dirty French but not for this kind of evening",2,CL5011,Las Vegas

Pre cooked food for Christmas dinner was a great disappointment.,1,OpenTable Diner,Tampa
Xmas dinner,5,OpenTable Diner,Los Angeles
"We dined at Dirty French for Christmas dinner, and the ambience was fabulous. Our food, however, was less so. Both chicken mains were undercooked/pink and when the waiter cleared the plates, there was no comment. The steak meal was INCINERATED.  Given it was Christmas lunch, the restaurant was busy and service was a little lacking, slow, drinks didn't arrive for ages and needed to be followed up - could do with tightening up.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
The food wasn't worth the prices they charge.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Wonderful staff, beautiful room, terrific food.  A place to have a good time, great food and forget your worries.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Very disappointing.  I was looking forward to taking my out of town friends to Dirty French.  While the food was good, the service was simply awful.  We had a 8pm reservation (and arrived on time), but did not get seated at our table until after 9pm (hostess was at least apologetic - - but that is much too long a wait for a Monday night!).  Our waiter seemed uninterested at best.   Long periods of time would go by where we could not locate him  - - my guests' drinks did not arrive until after our appetizers arrived (and only after we inquired of those that brought out the food).  A restaurant of that caliber (and expense) should have much better service.  On the bright side, food was quite good and the setting is comfortable (particularly the lounge where we stayed while waiting  . . .and waiting . . . and waiting for our table).  In short - - there are much better places to go in this neighborhood.",2,MarkR,San Francisco
It was wonderful and we had an amazing time!  The service was unparalleled and the food was just scrumptious!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"They have 7 entrees and we’re out of 3. On a Friday! They have 6 appetizers and we’re out of 2, on a Friday. So we had 2nd choices for everything, and definitely did not get their best dishes. Quite a shame for a destination dinner.",2,OpenTable Diner,Los Angeles
"Trout and pork chop was amazing. French 75 was great. Stay for after dinner drinks in the hotel lounge in the back. Cozy, fun vibe.",5,OpenTable Diner,Tulsa
"Food was terrific and loved the ambiance btw the cozy lounge, which served well for pre dinner drinks, dining room for dinner, then moved to the romantic and quiet garden for after dinner drink.   Service was consistently appalling. Gentleman at check in barked at me that he doesn't take coats and offered no solution. Later when he escorted us from the lounge to dinner he pointed out coat racks, but didn't offer to take and hang them up. Someone came and plunked down and walked away what turned out to be menus and a wine list on the table, even though we still had half of glass each left.   Server was lovely, but young man came to remove our plates even though we said we were not done. Our server was kind enough to reserve a table for us in the garden &amp; since we weren't escorted, we just sat down where she told us it would be. A new young lady came over and the only comment from her was, ""these tables are reserved."" We said we knew that &amp; it was for us. Beginning to ask her questions about the menu, she said she could not help us, but would get someone. Another lovely young lady arrived and saved the night. A very very disappointing experience, especially given cost.",3,Foodminded2,Chicago
The highlight of my NYC visit and one of the best meals I’ve ever had! Our waitress Pamela made the experience with her passionate and detailed description of each plate: lamb carpaccio and grilled oysters were the standouts followed by the tuna tartare and millefuielle.  I can’t wait for my next trip to NYC to come back for more!,5,LoreneB,San Francisco

"Food and service good, but is was extremely noisy and you dine bery close to the next table. Not recommended for special romantic occasions.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Was a nice place, although since it is in the basement the noise level of other patrons can be quite loud at times in the small low ceiling seating area.  But it was a nice cozy space temperature and spacing between tables was good.    Food was good, flavorful and served quickly and with enough time between appetizers and entrees.  Server was helpful with recommendations.   Server was great - I accidentally spilled something on my sweater and thought no one had noticed seconds later he arrived with a bottle of clothing soap and a bottle of soda water...for me.  Thought that was a little above the normal level of service and quite a nice gesture.  Would definitely return based on service and food.",4,LadyCinnamon,New York Area

"While the food was great except for the branzino, we had an early reservation. I asked for a table by the window on the main dining room level and even though there were only a few tables seated and most of the restuarant empty, they still had me sit upstairs in order to be by the window, which I really didn't appreciate.",4,daisy,New York Area
Great food and wonderful service. My only complaint is that it's really hard to get a reservation -- we ended up eating dinner at 6 pm which is really early for us. My recommendation is to make your reservation early!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Great service! Everything we ordered was top notch. Worth every penny. Reservation was also very prompt.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Took clients here for dinner and it was great. Excellent drink menu the pink Venus is a must to try!,5,OpenTable Diner,Houston
"Was seriously disappointed in the meal. I had high expectations going in....the ambience is fun, but the food a totally different story. The sushi was horrible...probably some of the worst I have ever had and the fish and side dishes subpar....if you are coming for drinks and the ambience, great...if you're coming for a great meal...go somewhere else.",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

Hot spot in the meat packing district,3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Went to Catch for a ladies night. Very crowded but great scene. Our reservations weren't until 11pm but even at that time the place was crowded. The food was great, we chose small plates like sushi and appetizers. Outstanding! If you want to go to the club afterwards make sure you get your hand stamped by the downstairs doorman. The club is the top floor with roof access, that place was crazy, loud dance music, dark, very clubby type feel but fun!",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"My second time dining here. The food is really good, but the service was lacking this time. Had to wait at the bar for over 45 mins for our table, which was about 30 mins too long.",4,Kristie,London
"The restaurant was nice, but after going to many other restaurants in the Meatpacking District, I had better expectations. The food was good, but I did not have a memorable experience and was not blown away. The waiter was ok and service between the app and entree was incredibly slow. I'll give it another try.",3,Capriessence,New York Area
"Fun place with a relaxed but vibrant vibe. It is definitely a new ""scene"" near the meat-packing district. Really interesting and varied menu. You can order for the table if you want or just for yourselves as individuals (which is what my friend and I did). You can eat very cleanly, too, if you prefer (i.e., steamed lobster, grilled fish, etc.) or one of their many other choices with fabulous sauces. The ""smores pizza"" dessert is amazing!",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Catch was great. The food was amazing. You can only get in early as its such a hot spot. Not cheap but what in NYC is?,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
I was pleasantly surprised that i wrote a note when making the reservation and the restaurant acted on it! Limited menu but food was great. Waiter was helpful and honest but service was slow. Would definitely recommend!,4,nycdiner,New York Area
Excellent overall experience but for one thing: the tables are cramped right on top of one another-no privacy,4,DanW,New York Area
Always good. Sword fish was little bit dry. But the rest was perfect.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
The food was good but not great. The starter arrived so quickly that it was obvious that it was heavily pre prepared. This was reflected in presentation and taste. The main course was much better but dessert was the best. It (banana brulee) was stunning.,3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"All was good except for the price, which is a tad too high for what you get. It is mostly a young crowd and very busy. I tend to prefer quieter places where you can talk to your friends without having to yell.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"where do I even begin?? Avoid this place, trust me, you'll thank me. The food would have tasted decent if it came out hot, instead we ordered about 7 dishes and they all came out cold and service was horrible (prob one of the worst I've ever experienced). I will never get back those 2 hours and $$$ back.",1,Foodielover,New York Area
"Small portions and extremely overpriced. With so many great restaurants in NYC, stay away from this one.",2,OpenTable Diner,New England
Great food and love ambiance,5,OpenTable Diner,Houston
"Very attractive, comfortable ambiance, a real old Italy feel to the environment, staff and service was great, quite good menu selection, food was okay but considering how highly we liked everything else, thought the food was certainly not bad but not up to the standards of the rest of the restaurant experience, meat and cheese platter were just okay, grilled shrimp with pasta were soft and over done.  Good wine selection.  Improve the food preparation a bump up and it would be a favorite place.  For now I'll just maybe come back.",4,Fromtheneighborhood,New York Area

"I came here with my husband. We were very surprised when our Uber dropped us off because we didn't really pay attention to the address and thought the restaurant was in LES but it's actually Chinatown. It's a casual but cozy spot with great food and very friendly service. We had a variety of apps and main dishes, they were all quite tasty! We would come back if we're even in the area.",4,NYEats,New York Area

Place is amazing. The eel sauce in pasta is so gpof,4,OpenTable Diner,Cincinnati
"Bacaro as become our go-to eatery. We love the ambience and the food and picked it, this time, for a special occasion - a birthday. It was much appreciated.   Love the food choices and the wine list, brick walls, unusual layout. We travel a fairly long way to get to Bacaro and it is always worth it.",5,Foodie,New York Area
Ask to seat us at 8:45pm for our 9 pm party but one person was missing from our party so they would not seat us. When our 4 th showed up at 9 pm they did not have a table for us and waited for 35 minuets to get seated.,3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Restaurant was very kind to accommodate changes to my reservation time, and the food was very good. But we found the service indifferent to cold. Waiter came over once and we ordered a bunch of small dishes and asked they be paced out. Almost everything arrived at once (there was literally no room on the table) bussers cleared our plates and we never saw that waiter again until he brought dessert menus. Does look like a lovely space for large parties. We just had an off experience.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

Bacaro is amazing!!! Great food tucked away in nowhere with refined service and low key excellence. Please don't spread the word...,5,Eatlinger,New York Area
Overrated.  The food nor the service warrant the hype.  Very average Italian however the cellar environment is plus.,3,Laurag,Melbourne / VIC
"Come here for the pasta but not the loud dinner crowds. Acoustics in the downstairs seating area are very poor. Our waitstaff needed to repeat something 4 times for several trips to our table due to the noise level.   Do not order the fried vegetables and shrimp - very average in flavor and was not worth the $17. I had the whole wheat pasta with duck ragu and the portion was a little small for the price tag, but it slightly made up for the noise and bland appetizer.   Dine before the 7PM dinner rush or request to sit in the semi-private lower floor dining area.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
We recently ate at Bacaro when visiting New York City with friends for the weekend. We were staying in China Town and it was great to find this place tucked away within walking distance of our hotel.  We had a wonderful leisurely meal with delicious food and wine. The service was excellent.,4,Lewmax,New York Area

"Bacaro is well worth venturing into Chinatown. The food is absolutely delicious - highly recommend the crab salad, duck ragu and lambrusco.",4,AllOvrNY,New York Area
"Rustic NY restaurants are my favorite - Bacaro takes ""rustic"" to a level beyond rustic (in a bad way) - more like old, unimaginative, and cramped with a feeling of being in my neighbor's basement.  Love the sister restaurant, Peasant.  Actually had to leave Bacaro after the appetizer to go to Peasant. Service at Bacaro was slow and overly casual.  Our appetizer of mozzarella and tomatoes was excellent, cocktails severed very slowly and at different times were only OK.  Will not go back, but if the area will certainly go back to Peasant.  Hard to believe these restaurants are associated.",2,ekfoodguy,New York Area
"Unfortunately , my dinner entree of mahi-mahi was very dry and disappointing , which was sent back, the scallop dumplings , though delicious we're Luke warm , and sent back re ordered and were amazing. The waitress was pleasant and understanding ..was just a little disappointed that the restaurant didn't offer to have a coffee or desert sent over. We didn't ask and they didn't offer. I was visiting my daughter who lives in NYC and she raved about the restaurant , I think she felt bad that catch was under par ..",3,OpenTable Diner,Philadelphia

"I went on a Friday. It was extremely crowded and noisy so we had to practically yell to hear eachother. Our waiter was also not too great. Other than this, I was happy with the restaurant.

"Absolutely amazing! No complaints. Although I would have liked to see belly dancers. Or at least, more of them",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I've been waiting for a trendy seafood focused restaurant that delivered. The bartenders were busy either chatting with the waitstaff or plainly ignoriong customers. The menu looked fantastic but didn't deliver - the mussels were luke warm at best, the tuna presentation a bore, and the sushi description had lots of ""bells and whistles"" in the description that didn't translate into flavor. I will say the handmade pretzels were delicious and the brussel sprouts were excellent. Glad I tried, no need to go back.",3,NYCDiner,New York Area
"Simply put: food was very fresh/good, but the service at the table was extremely poor. Unfriendly, impolite and unsatisfactory. A huge disappointment especially when the food was solid and my guests were looking forward to dining here.

The food was great from beginning to end. The little pretzels for the bread basket with the mustard butter were an awesome start. Great appetizers; I recommend the mussels in white sauce.

"A small but lively upstairs bar with stairs that lead you into the catacombs of private, candlelit dining downstairs. Bacaro seems unchanged in decor, but with all the modern services and charm expected to compete with NYC's elite. Highly recommend the Spaghetti Nero and Broccoli Rabe. The staff is friendly, patient, and the absolute opposite of pushy, making this neighborhood gem great for any kind of occasion. Highly recommend.",4,JessicaNoel,New York Area
"It was a busy evening when we went because of a party in the main room. We weren't able to sit down for 50 minutes after our scheduled reservation because some guests before us decided to loiter after the check came, but the restaurant's staff were apologetic and provided us with free prosecco and dessert. The food was so great it made up for the wait!",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"It was ok-  service was good, the place was nice. The food was underwhelming at best.",4,OpenTable Diner,Birmingham

Great Coffee and Brunch! Loved celebrating by birthday brunch here! Thank you!!,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"3rd time we’ve dined here. Each time the staff was friendly and accommodating. Ambience and decor is extremely nice with carved wood bar area. Menu changes seasonally, keeping some specialties. All Food has been outstanding from appetizers to main meals to desserts. Chef Eric L. Pays attention to every detail of a dish and the flavors are outstanding. Bar menu has some interesting and delicious cocktails. If you can visit the lounge after dinner, added bonus!! Enjoy!! We always do",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Great vibe. Lots of candlelight and cool music. Food was top notch and they have a creative cocktail list. Attentive service.,5,OpenTable Diner,Washington DC
Loved Esther and Carol’s! The food was amazing! The buttermilk fried chicken was delicious...salmon great too! The salads are huge so you can probably share. Would go back,5,Buffalove,New York Area
Pleasant ambiance with great service and good quality food.,4,OpenTable Diner,Belgium
We had a fun time there. I brought my work team there to celebrate a deadline and we had a great Time.  The cooked oysters are delicious! The service was super friendly and attentive. Love this place!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Second visit, great Food and Drinks, Order took 50 minutes although it was a Monday and half empty, one ordered side was missing and was served 10 minutes later, would come back anyway, super friendly service",5,julianocapo,New York Area
"Great food, great service, great decor! The owners came to our table and introduced themselves as well.",5,Jeniusj,New York Area
Friendly staff and delicious food. But we were visiting with friends we hadn't seen in a while and we couldn't hear each other because the overall ambient noise level was deafening.,4,Bowerycat,New York Area
"Was a sore disappointment. While not easy to have a bad meal in the city, I’m sorry to say that this was one. The oysters were great so it’s good to know they source well, but anything else cooked was overdone and flavorless. Mac n cheese was mushy and held zero flavor. Steak was overdone. Service was the highlight (relatively speaking) yet slow, but let’s give it a pass as the kitchen was perhaps behind due to an office holiday party happening concurrently. Speaking of, because of that, was at shouting level with my mates until that party was over. The vibe felt a little too forced. Will not be back, but thank you for polite service.",2,ERudd,New York Area
"Service still needs a lot of work, from an awkward host, unhelpful hostess, servers not knowing who’s table was who’s...",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
I came here with a group of friends.  We had reservations and needed to change it for a later time.  I spoke with Kevin who was so kind and easily changed our reservation.  My partner and I arrived before my entire party and we were allowed to be seated straight away.  The food was good.  Our waiter was Malik who was kind and made my experience very special.  I would definitely return for a date night.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"My friend and I had dinner and drinks here and the vibe, cuisine and price were all awesome! Great, friendly service, too. We had a table near the window, a nice full banquette all to ourselves and we totally dug the decor, including the very cool wood bar and countertop. The food was exceptional. I had the burger, medium, which came with bacon and sweet potato fries and my date had the fried chicken with mac and cheese. SUPERB! We started out with a caesar salad, not the haircut, that had some red romaine lettuce and carciofi fritti which were very tasty and quite a nice surprise as we made our way through the dish. Downstairs is a very cool music venue and we will definitely return to hear some vibes in the future. I would heartily recommend Esther and Carol 100% for a chill, sexy, not-over-the-top, romantic spot in the city.",5,OpenTable Diner,Los Angeles
"Great service, food and drinks. Will be back very soon!",5,AlliH,New York Area
I went with a large group and we all left completely fat and happy. Definitely will go back again. And again.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The food, drinks, service and music were all delightful.  A great place for a casual and delicious Sunday brunch.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Doesn't feel like a hotel restaurant at all.  Service was slick. Buttermilk chicken was delicious and the poached fish a complete  contrast but equally good.  Vibrant bar scene too.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Cardell and Kevin rock!!! So do their moms!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Great people, great food and great ambiance. A wonderful experience. The staff is upbeat and knowledgeable. The food was excellent and well prepared. The fact that one of the owners was present all evening and spent time circulating throughout the restaurant and engaging guests is probably why everything hums.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Fabulous Staff and Owner, Great food and energy! Amazing lounge downstairs. A definite must do!",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Esther and Carrol is nice. It's definitely good food and friendly service. We happened to go on a Sunday evening, which was a bit unfortunate as the music was very loud and made it quite hard to hear. The mix of bar and restaurant was definitely slated towards bar that evening. That said, if you are looking for a  mid week meal with friends or to have a date, it's perfect.",3,Jamesdotkelly,New York Area
Amazing food and customer service!  The manager went out of his way to talk to my family and showed us the basement concert space as well - really friendly!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

I can without a doubt say this is the best meal I've ever had in NYC. Every single dish we had from start to finish was unbelievable. Not to mention the service was impeccable. I cannot wait to go back and try the rest of the menu!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Food was incredible! Great music - but not too loud. Staff are so welcoming. Very very cool place!  New fave NYC restaurant for dinner with friends or special occasion!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
I split the fish fillet (red snapper) with a friend. It was outstanding! Garlic spinach was off the hook. Everyone at the table thoroughly enjoyed their meal. We had to beg for the check because the wait staff was slightly understaffed. The new decor was hip but the noise level was high. The music downstairs in the lounge was fantastic (long time NY jazz favorite Vanessa Trouble.),5,HealthNut,New York Area
The food and service were good.  It was a very quiet night so I think the servers were not quite sure what to do with themselves.  Everything was tasty and the service was attentive.  Really cool ambiance.  Hope they can get busier and make it.,4,BruceE,New York Area
The  food  was outstanding. Wonderful twists to American comfort food with healthy options. Service was attentive and drinks were great. Atmosphere was a really great vibe. Excellent addition. To nyc dining.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Great everything=-- atmosphere, design, food, service, all of it was execllent",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I've been visiting this place since July and like many NYC restaurants I was really excited re: their offerings. I went two nights in a row this week and was disappointed that I brought some new folks with me and both times the grain salad included an avocado that was half brown. The first night I ignored it, but the next night it was the exact same issue. I didn't bother to say anything because I don't feel I should need to. It was a bit embarrassing.   What's most unfortunate is that the food has been spectacular from July through August.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
I think this place is a solid 4.5 and the pork chop was a 5.  It was the best one I've had. Service was very friendly and the room had a fun vibe.  I'll go back for sure.,4,scottykeats,New York Area
"This is my second time dining at E&amp;C. Great food, great drinks, owners stopped by to greet us. It was our waiters second week so he wasn't familiar with many of the dishes nor the wine selections so he wasn't able to assist in that regard but overall the food was great as was the atmosphere.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The ambiance is very welcoming despite it being a good-sized restaurant. The service was excellent as our waiter was informative, not shy with suggestions about both food and drinks and just very congenial whilst not being overbearing. The poached snapper, grilled oysters and bread pudding were excellent.  The Branzino wasn't bad but since I'm a Branzino grill master I am hard to please when it comes to this fish.  The drinks were also excellent . I will definetly return. I didn't check out the lounge downstairs but will do so next time.",4,briggie,New York Area
The club downstairs is the real gem,3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Ambience was nice, food was so so. Service was great as they made a special effort to put a dessert plate together to celebrate a birthday. However, I ordered the fried chicken and after it was served and I had almost finished, the waiter came with another piece of chicken and said it was supposed to go with my dinner as I was a piece short. THAT was weird.",3,JenniferK,Dined 4 days ago
"Stopped by to meet an old friend for dinner. Great healthy options (they both had Green Bowl with chicken, which is supposed to be what Coco &amp; Cru is known for) and I had mushroom toast, which is one of my favorites. You only get one slice, but it was enough for me.   Kind of a quirky spot for a dinner restaurant, and was very uncrowded when I was there. They also close at 9, so our 8pm reservation started to feel a little rushed. Overall, a good experience and a nice spot for a casual, healthy-ish dinner.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Delicious brunch options! My friend and I really enjoyed our food.,4,LeeLee,Toronto
Love going here for a casual lunch or dinner. The green bowl is delicous,4,OpenTable Diner,New England
"I’m so confused why would you take a 8:30pm reservation when your kitchen closes at 8:45? And if that is the case, inform me when I am making the reservation. Being rushed to put in an order for food within 30seconds of sitting down is just not my idea of a good evening esp when it’s a birthday dinner   While the food was good, we were so rushed, and So disappointed. Won’t be back",2,AziN,New York Area
Even though we had to wait a bit we didn't mind at all as the bartender was genuinely friendly and attentive and the hostess and wait staff kept checking in with us.  Really friendly and engaging.  The good food was just an extra plus.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

Really horrible service and cold food! So bad! I couldn’t believe how small the food was to the price,1,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"This eatery is very health conscious but the food is great. Their chicken sandwich is amazing and they give you a hefty heaping of fries with every burger and sandwich order so it's awesome. The staff is very accommodating and friendly and they are always trying to help with whatever you need. The decor is also very welcome and every customer seems to be in their own little world, but friendly. I can't wait to go back for the 3rd time.",4,Nana,New York Area
The green bowl was incredible!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The mushroom toast was perfect for lunch on a wet, raw day.",3,OpenTable Diner,New England
"After reading all the amazing reviews, I was super excited to try out Coco &amp; Cru, but we were kind of underwhelmed. We had the avocado toast to start and it was just not fresh. The avocado was very bruised, old looking and there was way too much lettuce and onions on it and super under seasoned. We also had the green bowl with Salad which was good not great. Service was fine, the restaurant it self is super cute but the food really wasn’t that special, I won’t be back",3,AziN,New York Area
Love the food. Casual. Definitely a good place to visit in soho,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Good food, great service!",5,Taramizoo,Washington DC
"The food was delicious and healthy. I would highly recommend the green bowl. I went for brunch, but their dinner menu also looked good. My only complaint is that it was very crowded.",4,OpenTable Diner,Washington DC
"Came here with two friends on a cold night - the maitre d (or perhaps owner) was a bit rude, but other than that everything was great! The food was great (especially the specials) and it was nice atmosphere. Didn’t feel like you were packed in like sardines as can be the case with some of the lower east side restaurants. Be forewarned - they only take cash!",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"One of my go-to spots. I come here pretty regularly. They have an extensive menu and I hear from other people that various things are great, but I always end up getting the 3 for $10 empanada deal because I just LOVE their empanadas and that is such a great deal for quality food in this neighborhood! If I'm super-hungry or someone is willing to share them with me, then I also get some avocado fries. I just wish they had a bit wider variety in their drink selection, with more traditional liquors; their mainstays are sangria, one or two soju cocktails, and one or two sake cocktails-- and the sake-based mojito I had, while tasty, was not very strong. So I usually just get wine here.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

Great brunch place in Noho. A little noisy but the food is amazingly fresh/farm-to-table.,4,Katie,Philadelphia
Australian-style brunch. The really great thing about Coco &amp; Cru is that you can make reservations for brunch which is perfect with a bigger group. It's also very light and welcoming. I had the veggie breakfast - unfortunately the poached eggs were overdone. Would be great to see the addition of halloumi and a small hash brown instead of the American-style breakfast potatoes.,3,Appleisletobigapple,New York Area
"They had a good assortment of drinks (and food, though we didn't order). The atmosphere was fine, a bit nondescript.",5,OpenTable Diner,London
Good poached egg and avocado toast and other brunch items.  It was loud due to all the people talking and a bit cold because they had the doors open.  Nice servers and staff.,5,FoodieFun,New York Area
Great food and great atmosphere. The tables were a little close together but overall great,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Second time to Coco for brunch.  Wonderful options for a healthy brunch.  Excellent and attentive staff.  Will visit again when back in the neighborhood,4,outoftown,Philadelphia
The food was good at Coco &amp; Cru but the music volume was inappropriate for a saturday morning. We asked our waiter and the manager to turn it down but they all replied that it was the owner's preference to keep it loud. We're a group of twenty somethings and this music was club volume and made it impossible to hear one another. Won't be returning.,2,abigailk,Philadelphia
Good comfort food. Nice buzzy atmosphere,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

The food was good for the price. Service wasn't great and the music made me want to leave.,3,jgal131,New York Area
"Adorable! I met a few friends here for dinner. The waitress was very friendly and helpful when we had questions. They have a great range of beers, so even though they didn't have half of the 6 listed, the ones available were still great. I also had the green juice, which tasted mainly like cucumber and I liked a lot. There's such a nice range of menu options that I wanted to try everything (and really appreciate that the steak in the steak salad is grass fed!), but went with the portobello mushroom sandwich, which was solid, and the side salad (choice of salad or fries) had a nice lemony dressing. My husband had the pulled pork, which he liked, and the rest of our party had steak and chicken burgers, and we all cleaned our plates. I really wanted to get a savory grain bowl for the table to share too, but didn't have takers, so maybe next time! I'd like to get to try the juice and coffee options with booze too. Pretty place with nice tables and open-air front. Definitely hope to come back soon.",5,Halli620,New York Area
Good food and atmosphere but slow service,3,OpenTable Diner,Washington DC

"Amazing food; the staff was a little awkward through the meal though they seemed to want to be helpful. Incredibly, unbearably loud, and I'm ok with general dining bustle. The music was so loud everyone had to shout. I'd go back but maybe for lunch.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

Recently went here for brunch which was my second visit.  The first was for dinner.  I cannot find anything I don't love about this little place. The vibe is trendy and It feels like a little secret gen of a place. The cocktails are fabulous. The dinner food was incredible and I have to say the same about brunch.   The restaurant is a bit out of the way from where we usually like to go downtown but it is well worth it. The restaurant only takes cash but they do have an onsite ATM.,5,MW65,New York Area
Food was great. Not expensive. Great neighborhood vibe. I expect to go back often.,5,OpenTable Diner,Miami
"Restaurant had French Cafe ambience, menu was small but had good choices and very reasonable.  The only down fall was that service was extremely slow due to lack of staff (one waitress only).  Waitress was very pleasant even though she was servicing at least 30 people during brunch.",3,Joyce,New York Area

"Went there for the 1st time on a date with my wife. We were received by the host and sat down immediately. The host wanted to make sure we had the best 1st experience and we surely did. Every dish we ate was fantastic! So flavorful. Here is what we were recommended: steak tartar, crispy duck and tender beef. I honestly wanted to repeat the dishes since I enjoyed them so much. Fortunately that wasn't necessary since we were pretty full. We opted for the home made apple pie for 2. Honestly the best dessert to complement the dinner. We loved it and will definitely go back.",5,AnaamShahjahan,New York Area
"This small, unassuming place in the Lower East Side serves unbelievably delicious food. The cuisine is best described as healthy French. The three if us loved  our selections - gazpacho, tomatoes wth burrata, salad with assorted greens, duck, and Alaskan salmon. The salmon melted in your mouth. The veggies at this restaurant are amazingly fresh and flavorful. Highly recommend.",5,1stdiner,Washington DC

"Can't say enough goods things about V-Spot.  Everyone in our party of 5 loved the food, including the one non-vegan/vegetarian.  Servers got just a little harried when the place filled up but made an all-out effort to meet everyone's needs.  Creative dishes with just the right levels of spice.  Possibly the best vegan restaurant I've eaten in!",5,Delfuego,New York Area
Amazing food and generous portions. A great place for vegans to bring their omnivore friends. Everything is delicious and satisfying.,4,kait,New York Area
"The food here is always reliable for casual dining. The service, however, seems to get worse and worse every time I go. It used to be the 'go-to' spot in that area. Now, I kind of dread going there because I know I'm going have to deal with some slow or surly or understaffed situation.",2,emjaem,New York Area

A good East Village choice for good food in a nice environment,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"This was my first time at the vspot. I had bought 2 tickets for an online offer I found at $55 each for a 3 course organic dinner which included 1 appetizer, 2 entres, 1 dessert and a bottle of house wine. We ordered avocado fries which came with a spicy sauce, a bandeja paisa entre which is a Colombian based dish, and the taco entre dish and for desert the carrot cake. The portions for the entres and desert were HUGE and we didn't finish our plates. The food was amazing. The service was okay. There were only two girls working and they rarely checked up on you, had to wave them over a few times to get their attention. Also when they bring your water and wine (we got a rose) they did not pour your water for you nor did they open the bottle of wine, we had to open it ourselves. We also drank the wine out of regular glass cups as they did not have wine glasses, or at least we weren't given any. I would definitely go there again because the food was really good and you get a lot of food for the money. I paid $110 for two tickets but the bill for our food was about $90 when we added it up, so we def paid extra and their promotion should include at least two appetizers or at least two desserts instead of one.",5,OpenTable Diner,Houston

"I wish my experience with VSPOT was better than it was. Although I am not a vegetarian/vegan, I enjoy getting together with my friends to have a meat-free meal. Both my friend and I had heard about VSPOT from outer sources, but this was our first time here. The food is fantastic; it always pleases me when the texture of faux-meat is comparable to actual meat- in addition to the scent and taste! I’m sure that if I brought my meat-lover boyfriend here, he would not be able to tell the difference. Hooooowever, we were very disappointed and upset that we had to wait almost an HOUR for our food! Ridiculous, considering we went at a time when it wasn’t really busy. Our waitress also failed to check up on us and didn’t give us an update until I asked, 45 minutes after ordering. She wasn’t really knowledgeable with the menu either; I asked to substitute something from my entrée and she didn’t know the right answer and kept having to check with her peers. Then, would give me a vague answer which I would then have to ask a follow-up question on.. and have her go through the cycle again. At the very end, when she handed us our plates, she asked me to “help” her take my own plate because it “heavy”. I understand that plates are heavy… but if you’re a waitress, you should be able to figure that out, right? Put it on the table next to me! Make several trips!   Needless to say, the poor service I received lowered the rating I would have given this place. I’m sure it was a one time incident, but still disappointing. I will be returning, though, since I really enjoyed the food. Maybe takeout next time.",3,JennyC,New York Area
"Waitress was excellent, empanadas were fun to try, lasagna was vegan!",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Made a reservation here &amp; when we arrived was informed that the restaurant was closed for a private event.  Very disappointed that open table did not communicate with the restaurant to know this. We were then stuck because this was a time sensitive business meal, and we had to scramble like crazy.  Restaurant owner/manager was useless &amp; based on his handling of the situation I doubt I'll ever go back OR recommend to any friends.  #fail",1,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Nothing short of spectacular. Definitely a local find in NY that got our stay off on the right foot. Would have  eaten even more, but since they only take cash we had to limit our intake on what cash we had and what the ATM in the bathroom was willing to dispense.",5,Dane,San Francisco

"The food was extraordinary.  Thea, our server, our server was delightful and friendly.  When we arrived at 6:15, the dining room was quiet and intimate but became louder as the night went on.  The ambiance was warm and inviting.  We were celebrating our 20th anniversary and the experience was better than expected.",5,JoyB,Dined 3 days ago
"Gramercy Tavern is a must do dining experience. One of USHG’s Crown Jewels expectations were high. Generally they lived up to them. Service was a little slow to start. They took a drink order right away but it took a little to long for our server to get to us with the menus. Once he did though all was well. The pace, after the slow start, was perfect. Service was impeccable.   The food (tasting menu) ranged from excellent to transcendent, save for the dessert, which was just okay. We enjoyed both tasting menus, allowing us to sample twelve different dishes. So glad we did. Chef Anthony’s vegetable tasting menu is not to be missed. He treats vegetables as a star, not as an obligation to fill the needs of vegetarians.    About note on the dessert course. The beet sorbet, served as a prelude to the listed dessert course, was far superior to our two desserts. Mind you, they were quite delicious, but underwhelming when compared to all of the other amazing flavors we were served.  The beet sorbet and pumpkin spiced truffle saved the dessert course  All in all it was a spectacular dinner and we would, without hesitation, return.",5,OpenTable Diner,Washington DC
"My wife and I were celebrating our 2nd wedding anniversary.  We elected to have the tasting menu, and I had the wine pairing.  The food was good, but the service was lacking.  The paired wine was often poured 15+ minutes before the paired dish.  Things completely fell apart with dessert.  We waited over an hour for our dessert to show up.  When it did (poached pear with ice cream) the pear was cold.  And the table directly next to us, received their dessert before we did, even though we had been waiting longer.  Disappointing service from a restaurant known as a high-end institution in New York City.  We were offered a small discount on our check, but for a $470+ meal, I expected much better.",2,AndrewQ,Dined 4 days ago

"Gramercy Tavern was wonderful. My husband and I went there the day after my 50th birthday, we are from Northern California but love to celebrate our big milestones in NYC, and this was our first time at this restaurant. We got the prix fixe and every dish was incredible. I loved the elegant waitstaff and how discreet and non-overbearing they were, I loved the setting, and we thought each and every one of our dishes was spectacular--I had the squash salad, which was really a lobster salad with shaved brussels sprouts and a squash-based sauce, and it was heavenly, and my husband had the cavatelli which had the most amazing bolognese sauce either of us had ever tasted. And our main courses were incredible, too. Would return in a heartbeat, if we didn't live on the West Coast.",5,Minnams,San Francisco

"For a long time, Gramercy Tavern was one of my top 3 restaurants in NYC.  However, I was stunned by the price increases in the past year.

The server helped us order and create a lovely meal to fit our needs and even had the grilled oyster Florentine brought over from the tavern side. Every dish was done to perfection with the best ingredients and the flavors are just right. We will remember this meal and shall return the next time we are in the city!",5,ChicagoFoodie,Chicago
"I have eaten here several times over the last 10 years and I am amazed that the experience, particularly the service, is always able to hold up to (or exceed) the last time. The staff is friendly and accommodating while still maintaining excellent table service. I had set high expectations for my friend and I think she was surprised that I was not exaggerating. They accommodated her sensitivity to red wines for our pairings with the tasting menu and knocked it out of the park for both of us (because I definitely wanted the reds!) The extra time and effort this took never came across as an inconvenience. We have both spent many years in the restaurant business and often get spoiled by friends when we dine out locally. This meal felt like we were friends with the owner and being given special treatment. The food was thoughtful, seasonally perfect, and expertly and creatively paired. Can't say enough about how much I love this NY institution. Thank you!",5,OpenTable Diner,Richmond

"Without a doubt, the best ambiance in NYC (in my opinion). A candle-lit, sultry, and cavernous gem tucked away on Division Street in Chinatown.

I'm hollerin' at everyone to check this place out.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Bacaro had the best food I had my entire summer in New York. The ambiance was really interesting and so great for a night out. We had dinner at 9 o clock and the restaurant didn't start filling up until 10 o clock so it's definitely a late night place. It looks like a hole in the wall from the outside because it's in the middle of China Town but it is definitely a place worth visiting! I would definitely go back.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Bacaro is consistently wonderful. Try the zucchini flowers and when available the rabbit lazagna. I love the ambiance.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

"I love the informality of the bar upstairs with the communal table near the open windows. Downstairs, the tables are beautifully lit with candles and are nestled in corners of the wine cellar-like basement. Great for groups, or rent the entire downstairs for a party. Love the personal service, making you feel at home.",4,Adamsmull,New York Area
"After reading some mixed reviews, we were a bit leery about eating here. I have to say the food was very good- we had the chicken milanese and I guess it would be hard to mess that up! Appetizer special,of stuffed squash blossoms were very good ,but needed some kind of sauce . Same could be said of the mini meatballs- good, but screaming for something to dip them in.Service was great and the downstairs rooms are inviting. You will be seated with strangers if you are a small group, but it was not a problem for us.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"We really wanted to love this place. Sadly, the laughably horrid service and some missteps from the kitchen put a damper on our meal. We wanted to order a few plates with wine, then order more as the evening progressed. However, we were informed by the waitress that the policy is for the kitchen to not accept partial orders, and we would have to place our full order all at once. Of the food we ordered, most was delicious, but the crab salad was engulfed in so much mayonnaise we couldn't taste any crab. A pasta dish had to be sent back because the spaghetti was crunchy instead of al dente. When we told the waitress, her response was ""OK."" and she turned her back. We had to ask for the dish to be replaced. She then avoided our table.",3,OpenTable Diner,London

"This was my second time at Bacaro and it was just as memorable as the first time. The food is excellent and the service is friendly. The restaurant is on two floors, the street level has an amazing long table next to the window and the lower level is an intricate group of rooms with stone walls and pillars. Stunning. The down side is that it can be noisy when the restaurant is full. Despite that, I warmly recommend this restaurant.",4,MCSi,New York Area
"loved the decor...was told by friends that it was not expensive and delicious. It's not expensive which is great but I found the food OK, not as good as I was lead to believe...spme thigs great , some things just ok. very nice bar tender lady When I booked I was told there was only a 6:00 reservation possible for 5 people.....the entire time we were there (about 1 1/2 hours) we were the only ones downstairs so not sure where the heavy bookings were.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"This place was amazing. Food was delicious, the wait staff was chill, and the ambiance was something that is almost impossible to find elsewhere. HIGHLY recommend this to any couple/date night!",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Small Plates of food was perfect for sharing since there was a larger group (6) of us.  We were there for a post work dinner with some out of town co-workers.   Our seats were in the basement which had a great cavernous feel but a bit on the dark side.   It got very loud as the placed filled up so if you're looking for something quiet, stay upstairs or non-prime time.   We had shared few salads and they were so crisp and fresh! Added to the mix, we had some fried stuffed zucchini flowers and other fried offerings.  They were surprisingly light and airy.  Pasta portions were generous and the Fish was charred beautifully and very simply prepared.  Would go back again with a smaller group.",4,WeilingC,New York Area
This restaurant gem is tucked away on a side street in the outskirts of Chinatown. The small bar where you enter belies a cavernous yet cozy downstairs dining area. Food is excellent. This is a great place to bring a date. The dark and intimate romantic setting inside is enhanced by the juxtaposition of mysterious Chinese wholesale stores up and down the same block.,5,theflash,New York Area
"Everything is wonderful about this place--the subterranean decor, the friendly waitstaff, and the consistently good food. I have had a few larger group dining experiences here and find the group menu not as enjoyable however, and the need to book from a different menu with a minimum payment for each person has detracted me from organizing larger group dinners there. Overall though, a wonderful gem.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Absolutely perfect in every regard. Never rushed, always helpful, completely outstanding. Food and wine arrived promptly, and the ambiance and seating was absolutely marvelous for our large gathering.",5,Srella,New York Area
"Great ambiance downstairs. This has such a rustic yet chic feel. Selections of wine by the glass/quartino/carafe is excellent, and all of the wines are very unique and of high quality. Our third time here, Bacaro does not disappoint on food. The razor clams are downright delicious, the pastas are delightfully al dente, and if you can catch the stuffed zucchini blossoms on special, don't pass them up! They are deep fried in a very light batter and stuffed with the lightest, creamiest ricotta. Plates are all fairly small but great for sharing and sampling lots of different dishes.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Lovely dining experience. Felt like a secret gem in the middle of lower Manhattan. Ambiance was cozy and romantic - dim lighting, candles and a feeling of being tucked away in someone's fabulous wine cellar.

"Service makes a difference, people! Waited a good 10 minutes before our waitress showed up. Asked if we were ready to order. When we asked to see a wine list she acted surprised. 10 more minutes and then she had no idea about the wine we were thinking of ordering. More time goes by as she checks with the sommelier. Brings the more expensive bottle  (naturally). After that service proceeded just fine. Well, except that we said tap water was fine, yet they poured Fiji water and that was $10. The steamed artichoke was delicious as was the burger and the broccoli rabe. Maybe give it another chance.",3,Cville,Richmond
"First, foods are too salty. Drinks make me full. Who gave 3stars to Jean?  Second, they are very unfriendly to foreigners who is not fluent in English.  especially server named Emily, she was sucks. From beginning to end, she is unfriendly With unplasant face, because our English isnt good.   (How many languages can you speak, Emily?) Also they guided us to worst seat, just infront of the outer storing place.   Not recommanded. Definately.",1,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

"Everything was great except for the way we were seated. We were a party of two, we sat across from each other at a long communal type of table that could fit about 18 ppl total with high bar type chairs. We could hear conversations of both the parties to our right and to our left. Next time I’ll be sure to request a private table. Food was excellent, absolutely no complaints.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Go to this place and you won't regret it! It's amazing.  It was good but got a little crowded.  Vegan options only available if you order the side dishes. To be honest the vegan side dishes were ridiculously good, had to order 4 of them, but maybe that's even better because i got to try a couple of things rather than 1 course. Very good. Good place for a date. P.S. I wrote a special request on the reservation along with my number, and received a call just as requested to clarify what it is I needed. Excellent place.",5,Russel,New York Area
Great location and venue.  Loved the downstairs.  Only problem was change over of staff/shift during our meal meant that our entree didn't arrive until 50 minutes after our starters had been cleared away.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Overpriced poor quality food. Our server never checked on us and rushed us to order. My $55 steak was way over cooked. I asked for Med rare and receive almost well done. My boyfriends salmon was bland.,1,OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 3, 2018"
There was a leak in the ceiling and there were strange umbrellas containing the water. My pasta had too many potatoes. The hostess was a little rude.

"We went here for Restaurant Week and the three course,  $42 dinner. Usually NYC restaurants like to showcase their most excellent items as they pick up new customers who've never tried the place previously. Unfortunately, everything our group of 4 ordered was average at best, except the desserts which were very good. Evidently, Mercer Kitchen wasn't able to handle the larger RW crowd on a Friday night and retain their high quality food standards. The mushroom salad had way too much parsley and was just ""OK."" The pizza was burned. The salmon was mushy and under-seasoned. The pasta was al dente and flavorful but the portion size was skimpy. Mercer missed the mark here big time.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I haven't eaten here for 5-6 years but in the past I went as often as I could afford to and always invited friends &amp; family to dine there for lunch.  I never had a meal there that wasn't special and tasty. I insisted on taking 3 guests for lunch and while some of it was good (pizza, tacos and dessert), the salads and salmon were just so-so.  One person wanted the Mercer Burger but that was no longer on the Restaurant Week menu. Nothing stood out with that delicious, scrumptious taste you don't want to leave your mouth.  That was a big change and a bigger disappointment and I felt a bit foolish, having raved at how good it was going to be.  The service, regretfully, did not change: it was slow and inattentive.  I feel bad that I did not enjoy the experience as I did in the past and probably will not return.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Went for a late lunch during restaurant week. Waited 10 minutes between being seated to anyone coming back to see if I needed water or a drink. The restaurant was not busy and I was wedged between two other tables of diners when other tables were open.  At that point I decided to leave because I didn't think 3 courses would be served in a timely fashion.,1,Bishkop,New York Area
"Enjoyed a lovely lunch with friends. Impeccable service.  One woman in particular, knew the menu so extensively and had a talent for describing it in such a way, that literally, everything had my mouth watering.   It did not disappoint.  Fresh, high quality ingredients prepared in creative, innovative ways.  Warm olives, yes!  Shrimp salad with, not one but, two different vinaigrette dressings ... Highly recommend.",5,OpenTable Diner,Tampa
"For an upscale restaurant/bar, it was appalling that the staff was cleaning out our table when we had not even asked for our bill. It was a rude way of telling us either to leave or order more. This is the kind of treatment I expect at a Chinatown dimsum place but not at a resto marked $$$$.  The peekytoe crab on lettuce cups was waaaaay too salty. I should NOT have ordered that. This was my second time to go here because the first time I was here, the service was excellent. Clearly, it was a big mistake coming here again. For sure I am never coming back to Mercer Kitchen.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

"We won't be returning to Mercer Kitchen. We've liked it in the past. We made a reservation on OT, they offered a table in a rough location (under the stairs), we requested another table... And then it went downhill. The host was annoyed, rude and belligerent to us. The upstairs Cafe staff and manager were very cordial and offered to help, but by then my wife wanted to leave. One toxic host can turn things upside down even for a great restaurant.",1,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"They booked me at a lousy table not a communal table. Boring restaurant with food overpriced and underwhelming. They have a lot of customers so your individual satisfaction is not important to them. Go to a restaurant that will wow you, not take your business for granted.",2,CustomerReview,New York Area
"Terrific location and space.  Service staff couldn't have been nicer - we stayed there a long, long time for dinner on a Saturday night and they let us without pushing us along.  Food was delicious (group had burgers/salmon/roast chicken), atmosphere is cool but not oppressively so.",5,StuR,New York Area
"Very nice place but noisy. People congregate between tables and speak loudly. None of the restaurant staff  intervenes. Otherwise, good food and nice service.",4,DrDan,New York Area
I brought my very special date for his birthday. We were treated like royalty. He felt very special. THANK YOU!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The food and the ambiance were amazing! Worth every dollar! However the service was super slow! The waitress was nice but the food took forever, over 2 hours for lunch! In the end it was worth the wait!",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The ambiance and service was great but the food was not up to standard for the price. My friend and I went there for my birthday. We shared our dishes. We were very pleased with our appetizers but our mains and dessert left a lot to be desired. For dessert we ordered the chocolate cake and apple crumble, I could not fault the chocolate cake but the apples in the apple crumble were hard they needed to be stewed for longer. Service was great and their drink menu has a lot of variety, we had plenty to choose from. If I was to go back it would just be for a drink and some apps.",4,LRose,New York Area
Restaurant week Great value for the three course meal Loved the apple crumb desert And the grilled shrimp,5,lala,New York Area
Sommelier chose a very appropriate wine to our taste.  The fish and chips were incredibly light and crispy.,4,Epic,Toronto
Food was good and service was very good as well. They had a gluten free menu which a friend needed but the server didn't seem that well versed in it. It ended up being OK but semi frustrating. She was very friendly though.,4,Jess,New York Area
"Mercer Kitchen Waitstaff are top notch! Very personable, helpful with menu explanation, and attentive. Restaurant is basement level, beautifully lit with candles, very cozy.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"We were given a table  right away.  The waitress came over pretty quickly considering there were not too many people at the restaurant when we walked in.  We sat 15 minutes with your menus,  The bottle of wine was slow to come.  We waited another 15 to 20 minutes for the appetizers after I complained, they came right away,... 2 were cold, the  runners came out with our entrees one minute after our appetizers arrived!!!! Never got bread, oil, salt and pepper water glass refills and I an not just exaggerating!  The waitress came over and halfheartedly apologized, and continued her conversation with her waitress companion.  Seriously,  will we go back there again ?",1,Mary,New York Area
"The ambience was great. Presentation was amazing. I had mixed baby lettuce, fusilli pasta with mushrooms, warm chocolate cake. Pasta perfectly done and the mushrooms were nice and meaty..mmmm. however, the vinaigrette for the salad and lemon cream for the pasta were bit heavy in salt. But aside from that great experience",4,SeekingGoodEats,New York Area
Good vibe. Food and drinks were very tasty. I got great feedback from my co-workers on my dining spot choice for our dinner..,4,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
"As usual Mercer Kitchen lived up to it's well deserved reputation.  The service was excellent.  The food delicious and abundant. I don't care for olive oil with my bread, I asked for butter and a generous pat was brought immediately.  Recommend for young,old and in between",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Nice place for brunch. Food is good. Drinks are ok. Unlimited minosa or Bloody Mary for $15 with meal. Not strong but exactly what you normally get with those types of deals. Overall they do everything well enough for an everyday type restaurant,5,OpenTable Diner,Raleigh
Brunch was awesome,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlantic City
Great place for whiskey lovers! The servers are super knowledgeable. Ask for recommendations if you can’t decide what to order.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Nice outdoor seating.. Great drinks and snacks,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"A group of 5 of us came for Brunch at noon on a Saturday and for a while, we were the only people in the place, but around 1-2 it started filling up more. We did the unlimited mimosas and they did not disappoint. Our server was lovely and the food was really delicious.  A successful brunch and we weren't crammed and could hear one another talk.",4,Tallgirlschram,New York Area
Very limited food menu...huge whiskey offerings...nice bar scene but very loud..not a place for conversation,3,Chatham33,New York Area
Awful on a Saturday night. Too noisy. I would never go back on a Saturday night  Great selection toon of scotch,3,Debbylovesfish,New York Area
"Good food, good vibes, the whiskey selection was great.",4,SeeLee,New York Area
"Food was terrible nothing like their website showed, we did not finish a single dish yet our waitress never once asked if the food was okay.",2,OpenTable Diner,Houston
Small but well managed food menu.  Very impressive inventory of scotch and rye whiskeys.,3,Smlcpa,New York Area
"The waitress was obviously very new, so I can't hold it against her and we still tipped her well, but the management could have done a better job training her. For a bar known for its bourbon selection, she didn't know a thing about bourbon and had to ask questions about the menu. She did ask, and I give her a lot of credit for that. But the restaurant should have either trained her better or provided a buddy to train her while she served customers. Thankfully, it was slow when we were there so it didn't delay service too much. Overall, the food is amazing and I'm sure with the right staff this is a great place to go.",4,OpenTable Diner,Baltimore
"Love this place! Their focus is on whiskey, but they have a large selection of other cocktails, beer, and wine. Love the Gin Float and Antioxidant Martini! Food is amazing. I especially love the mac and cheese, fried chicken, and lamb burger. The vibe is classy yet easy-going and fun. Good music. Can't wait to go back!",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
What a find! Expert food...excellent wine...perfect service.  In the hood for a show at the Abrons Art Center -will make it back just for this restaurant. Perfection.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Gorgeous little french restaurant with delicious traditional dishes and lovely serving staff. Would recommend to anyone! Wines are a little pricey but worth it for the pairing possibilities.,5,Faebot,New York Area
"The food, ambience and price are all so wonderful!!!!",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Went here with a friend after seeing a movie at the nearby Metrograph Theater. Small cosy space that is not too loud but also busy w/lots of other people dining. Great food and they also had a great wine list (by glass and bottle) plus a cocktail menu.  The creme brulee was awesome, as was the wintery beef with carrots and onions. I will definitely return.",5,OpenTable Diner,Washington DC

Food was very very good. I will definately be back because of the very friendly service and very good food!  Thanks!!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

"Great place. Our second time. Last time had Cote dE Boeuf, this time the mussels. Both meals were excellent.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Very cute place at the corner of Henry and Jefferson. Sat at the bar and chatted with my wonderful dancing server Megan and a friendly fellow customer. The steak tartare was exactly what I was looking for. Got tipsy from a couple cocktails (two bridges and quite strong) and the addictive bread and butter that came with the table. Will definitely be back and would recommend.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
A place to have an affair.,5,Knoops,New York Area
"We reserved for a special occasion but upon arriving, there appeared to be a holiday party occupying the entire restaurant. We couldn't find a server to even ask for our table, so we had to make do with another restaurant nearby.",1,HannahOs,Atlanta
It's my holiday season home where joy and warmth pervade.,5,Knoops,New York Area

A fabulous place... where all the cool kids go.  Truly a neighborhood landmark,5,Knoops,New York Area
The restaurant and Open Table need to communicate better that the restaurant accepts CASH ONLY. This came as a surprise and fortunately we had enough cash to cover our meal.,3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
The waiter forgot my order. Half way into my meal. I reminded him that I ordered an extra side. The chicken was a bit salty.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Great food and service, but would’ve liked a cozier table.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Friendly, fun and the food is perfection.   The servers are all really professional and wonderful.  The atmosphere is great and I highly recommend this restaurant.  We had the best time and will do it again soon.   Kindest regards,   Melissa",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
We had our friend's bachelorette dinner. It was a lovely service. They accommodate a large party. The food was delicious!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Did not realize it was cash only. They do not take credit cards. Food was ok. I would go again if I was in the neighborhood.,3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Fabulous, convivial bistro with wonderful food and service.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
This restaurant is a secret.  It has excellent food in a casual setting.  Service is friendly and competent.  We shared the mussels and the duck breast.  Both were delicious.,5,CLSIMON,New York Area
"Very disappointed in this selection. My wife and I needed to meet a couple friends in the neighborhood, and they like French food. I had hoped the food would be better; some dishes were better than others, and I feel like the portions were way off on some things. For a charcuterie board, they gave us 5 slices of each sausage (small logs, not a big slice), which I thought was very stingy.  The wine list was WAY overpriced, especially considering that the restaurant is CASH only. There weren't really bottles under $50, which, for a bistro, is absurd. Their rose, which was good, was at $52 from Corsica. I just felt taken advantage of, which is not what I look for in a neighborhood bistro.",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"This is a small bistro hidden in the edge between the Lower East Side and Chinatown.  The food is always excellent, and the prices reasonable. The owners live locally, and the clientele is quite diverse, as is the staff.  The bar has a good selection of nouveau mixology drinks, but they also make a good, no-nonsense martini.  Note: it is CASH only, so bring some dough, although there is an ATM in one of the restrooms!",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Service and food was very good. Nice low-key place to meet friends. Love the big open doors to let fresh air in.,4,adest,New York Area
"The food, ambiance and service were all great. We had a great experience.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Overall, mediocre. The food is pretty good but for the price point, in a fairly isolated part of Chinatown, I would have expected more. What really brought the experience down was the indifferent waitstaff. Might be worth a second try for happy hour.",3,NeighborhoodEater,New York Area
Always a great experience.  My favorite place for summer oysters.  The wines are great and reasonably priced.  Authentic food and a great neighborhood find.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The place is cute, my friend and I went early, so it wasn't very crowded.  We both felt that the service could have been better, the food came quickly, but the attitude was lacking.  When I go out to a restaurant I like to feel welcome, our waitress was kind of a downer.  I didn't love the salmon, but to be fair, I'm picky about fish.  It was well cooked, but the seasoning was minimal, and it was served on a small side portion of chick pea salad, it felt like something was missing.  The menu is small, it didn't really thrill either me or my friend, although she had the chicken and she said it was good.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Stefan and his team do a fabulous job of curating a little piece of neighborhood France.  Warm and inviting.  The food is first rate, with the best tartare and tartine we've had in the city.  The wines and the food are authentic and reasonably priced.  We've taken parents and friends, gone on a date night and a lazy evening when we are too tired to cook ourselves.  Never a disappointment.  And one year in, they are getting better still.  Merci beaucoup!",5,MSFridayDec15,New York Area
Stefan has an incredible recipe for delicious fun and culinary delight!!,5,Knoops,New York Area
Classic neighborhood French bistro.  Good reasonably priced wines. Great tartare and tartine.  Boeuf de carottes and other French home style fare.  A warm and comfortable place to share a quiet romantic meal or an evening out with the kids or parents or a group of friends.,5,MSFridayDec15,New York Area
"Last minute find for Sunday Brunch.  Delicious all around with the thickest steaks properly cooked I've seen for a Steak and Eggs brunch.  Not too busy, attentive service, great food all around.  Bonus solo acoustic guitarist playing classics while you chat and enjoy your meal.",5,Sundeep,New York Area

Damn that was tasty,5,OpenTable Diner,Philadelphia
Had a solid meal and great drinks! Especially enjoyed the roasted cauliflower! Cant wait to dine there again..,5,Leogirl,New York Area
"Like that this place is spacious, but it took awhile before a server got to us. Then the waitress forgot we order fires until I reminded her and then ketchup for the fries.",3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Very crowded and noisy.  Table for 3  was too small.  Food and service was very good especially the potato chips,5,JoAnn,New York Area

"Pleasant atmosphere, very good service, good food, competitive prices.  Really diverse menu, something for everyone, and they take reservations!!",4,fudy66,New England
"Could be the loudest restaurant we've ever been to -- couldn't hear each other or our waiter.  We were seated right next to the restroom (a one person one at that) so constant stream of people in and out around us.  Food was ok, not great.  We probably wouldn't go back.",2,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
"Great place to eat...fun atmosphere. The fired chicken was amazing, and great to share as an appetizer. You certainly walk away feeling full and satisfied, and not too overly expensive.  Would definitely recommend to a friend.",4,OpenTable Diner,Las Vegas

Best burger! I love The Smith!,5,GabrielleA,New York Area
Great food and service!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Always an amazing meal. We had out of town guests in, with their child, and The Smith WOW'd everyone. Chicken Parm was great and not super heavy.  Pork Schnitzel was so good (who knew?)!  Pepper burger was awesome, jalapeño cheese grits out of this world.  We love coming to the Smith.",5,DLVATL,New York Area
Our server Emily rocked our socks off.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I had quite a large group of people in my party, and The Smith was extremely accommodating, quick service, and delicious food. This is one of the smaller locations, so expect to wait on a busy weekend night. Love the blue cheese fondue, mac and cheese, gnocchi, and prosecco. It's one of the best meals I've had in the city.",5,Cassie,New York Area
We've been to the East Village location many times and never disappoints.  A little pricey but the food is tremendous and the portions are generous.   The  service is always prompt without being intrusive.  A good time and we will definitely be back.,4,JonathanB,New York Area
Always a perfect neighborhood meal!  Authentic and original cuisine.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

"Just an all around great time. Excellent food, excellent drinks, excellent service.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Great food and time!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"A great spot for a group of friends or a family gathering. Lots on the menu for sharing, which is what we chose to do. A few apps, a few mains, and some desserts, and we were filled to the brim. The wine seems expensive for what it is and everything is a bit overpriced, but overall we enjoyed ourselves. This is a reliable spot that I suggest for groups and I'm rarely disappointed. We ordered the calamari, the tartare, a dozen oysters, duck wings, a kale salad, and cocktails to start. Then we had the NY strip, brick chicken, chicken meatballs and spaghetti, ragu pasta, another salad, and everything was great. We let them know we were sharing and asked them to cut up the chicken and steak into strips for us, which they obliged and it was exceedingly helpful. For dessert, we ordered the bread pudding and some chocolate dessert, I can't recall the name. We were completely satisfied and would definitely return.",4,deekay,New York Area
"been to the smith many times always love the energy, the chips, and cocktails",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

"Perfect way to spend New Year’s Eve! The open bar had great liquor choices and drinks. And the food was exceptional. I got the salmon and my boyfriend got the filet mignon. Our waitress, Emily was the best!! Would definitely recommend and go back again!",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Very good service and food. I have been there several times and the wait staff always friendly and attentive.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"First time at The Smith and was not disappointed. None pretentious American menu that fits many tastes and done and served perfectly.  Loved the spicy salmon, gnocchi, short ribs and branzino.

Food was excellent service average despite the large # of people in the restaurant. The place was cold not sure if they had a heating issue,3,Tonye,Austin
"The service here is second to none.  Patrons are actually cared for by a team.  Kudos! The food is excellent.  Soup, salad, main dishes and desserts were all superb. What I did not like and would stop me from returning is the noise.  One cannot engage in conversation.  Some acoustic panels set into the ceiling squares, a carpet and some cushioned walls would reduce the volume.  And please get rid of the cheap flower arrangements.  They look funereal.  Better to do none than cheap mums and carnations.",4,Maddie,Philadelphia
"delicious food, good wine selection, good vibe. definitely will return",5,OpenTable Diner,London
"My fourth visit to this establishment , as the previous three had been excellent. Dined with friends and family. We were subjected to a ""Meal Auction"" of who is having this and did you order this , for Appetizers and Entree's. Clearly the runners had not been provided with a table plan by the Server. Restaurant Service 101.... Wine suggested by the Sommelier was not available, as the one bottle they had in inventory the previous day had been Sold. Four of my party ordered Oysters and Shrimp Cocktails (2 of each) and for some bizarre reason, these were served together and not on individual plates. *Not every Guest likes to share plates. Steak entree was under seasoned and tough. Check back was relatively insincere and my hardly touched Ceasar Salad went un-noticed. There would have to be a compelling reason for me to return or recommend.",2,OpenTable Diner,Los Angeles
"The lunch menu prices are the reason this place is so empty $24 for a pasta? That's dinner for sure, and with so many other options in Soho, this is worth skipping",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

"Waiter didn't come around to take orders for more than 20 minutes and not a single staff member was to be found when looking for one.  Food was middle of the road and overpriced.  Also, the lunch menu was very sparse.  I get it--you may not want to have too many items on a menu but they needed a few more options.  Would it kill them to offer the chance to add chicken or shrimp to a garden salad?  I should think not (and if it was offered, it wasn't apparent on the menu, nor did the server make reference to it being an option).",2,Anonymous,New York Area
We loved Sessanta. Great food and service - definitely check it out.,4,Michael,New York Area
Service was t great but the actual food was very good!,2,Karina,Atlantic City
"They had a Sicilian inspired menu with authentic Italian dishes and reasonable prices. Some of the best bottarga pasta and cannolis in town. Now they've changed chef and veered into pseudo Italian (new Italian-American?), with poor taste founded in no tradition (red peppers with pasta and squid...). Closer to LI than to Cefalu'. What a shame. Go for a drink, or sit in the front-door patio, but avoid the full meal!",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Overall great food and ambiance! The pistachio tortellone and the Orata were our favorites.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
We really enjoyed our time at Sessanta. Friendly and extremely attentive service. Thoughtful cocktails. Delicious pasta.,5,AMjp,New York Area
Service was good and manager was apologetic for the horrible food preparation.  the appetizer was way too salty.  The manager agreed and delivered a new order that was adequate.  The main courses were both disgusting.  The fish was stuffed with some kind of pureed vegetables.  This was not part of the description on the menu and was an unwelcome surprise.  The meat was swimming in butter.   They have recently introduced the menu and new chef.  We ended up without a meal or a bill....,1,mara,New York Area

"Chef Adam prepared a truly amazing meal for our birthday celebration. Each first course was better than the next, beautifully presented and utterly delicious. The pastas were amazing! Fresh, perfect amount of sauce, cooked to perfection. I particularly liked the lemon pasta. The entrees were great (although I stopped at pasta, I tasted a few). The steak was melt in your mouth flavorful, so too was the hanger steak. Hurry quick to the restaurant Chef Adam has just begun and word will be out soon about the wonderful food.",5,OpenTable Diner,Philadelphia

"Visited Sessanta for the third time to experience Restaurant Week with a fellow blogger friend. Overall, the meal was delicious! My octopus was overcooked, but the flavors were spot on. Other dishes were superb and included the tuna crudo, fettuccine bolognese, grilled salmon and tiramisu. Also, The Gatsby was a great drink choice!",5,Ashia,Washington DC

We went this place during testaurant week. There wasn't much option to select from the restaurant week dinner. There was no option for vegeterian choice and simple pasta was under cooked. My wife only eat veg and chicken but no item in menu was chicken dish. Service and ambience was good but food was not something my wife and I liked.,2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Came for brunch around 3:00 on weekend.  Place was largely empty and we were seated right away.  Ordered and food never came.  Waiters kept walking by avoiding eye contact.  After 30 minutes I made a scene, manager investigated, something had gone wrong (probably the order wasn't entered).  I wanted to leave, he asked us to stay and comped us the entire meal.  The food (when it came) was all very good.  The manager did the right thing, which was appreciated.  If this was a once-in-a-great-while screw up, which happens to every restaurant, I would recommend.  But since I have no way of knowing if this was symptomatic of common problems or a stuff happens, I can't recommend.",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
It was fabulous! Went for my birthday with a group of 6 girls and we had our private area right near the wine cellar. Food was delicious and the service was great! They were extremely attentive yet never rushed us. The ambiance was incredible. Highly recommend!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Amaizing food , great value , truly Italian  Just a little be noisy , not sure if music in the ambience helps or make Americans be even more loud than usual :-)",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Delicious food, some offerings slightly over-salted but still very good. The ambiance is a touch shy of perfect. The service is stellar. I'd definitely do it again!",4,Jeff,New York Area
"Excellent food and drinks with a very nice ambiance -- good for dates, special occasions, or just a great dinner!",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The service was great, the decor reminds me of a low budget Freeman's alley but, the food was just fair. We tried a bunch of apps and mains. First, the razor calms had too much breading, pasta with duck ragu didn't taste like duck ragu, and everything had the same flavor of garlic and red sauce. Cute place but the food was so so,",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"There are so many amazing things about this place. The service is impecable! The food was amazing, I had the cuttlefish ink pasta and my date had the duck ragu pasta dish. I am a regular restaurant goer in the city, and this was one of my favorite dining experiences. The drinks were also great! My date and I tried to sit downstairs (really romantic!) but there was a large party and it was very loud. We ended up sitting upstairs (which is still very nice!). The waiter and wait staff was one of the best I've seen in New York. Very highly recommended.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Don't love the location....neighborhood is disturbing, and there's no sign! People call it romantic, but it's a bit like being in a scene from The Count of Monte Cristo. Noise level was unbearable, so we moved upstairs, where smoke from the outside wafted in. Duck ragu was very good, as was the gnocchi.",3,Mopman,Los Angeles
Amazing atmosphere! Would definitely recommend this place!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Lovely restaurant , buzzy ambience and pretty noisy but without large groups would have been romantic. Good menu and not typical fare. Waiting staff friendly.",4,Clazza,London
"Cool space, bricks, low lights, and cubby hole ""rooms"" but hard surfaces make for a bit of sound if it's crowded. Semi-communal tables (two parties to large but not huge tables) means getting some of other parties' conversations but not sitting in your lap. Mostly had specials - quite good - menu-listed pork shank excellent. All Italian wine list reasonable to ""special occasion"".",3,Excellent,New York Area
"Overall a decent night out although the food portions were a bit small and the service was a bit impatient. The communal tables aren't so bad but I did request a stand alone table. I realize it is a request but letting me know would be nice, instead of just leading me and my date to a table. The atmosphere is clean and pleasant which is a plus.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
I love the rustic decor and food here. I have passed this place a thousand times in our neighborhood and now will be back for sure.,4,missleonyc,New York Area
we really were surprised when we went down stairs. The food was excellent and the whole experiece is one i look forward to having again.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Amazing food, amazing service in a wonderful romantic atmosphere.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"One of the best Italian meals I have had in the city! Would highly recommend, especially for a date spot!",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"A hidden gem in the odd neighborhood that borders the Lower East Side on the south and Chinatown east. From the street, Bacaro looks like a small four-table restaurant with a marble bar. But the treasure is walking downstairs into the cavernous wine cellar where the rest of the tables are. You're immediately transported to an antiquated scene in Venice. All of our food was outstanding, including all the specials we ordered. Mainstays that I would recommend are the Spaghetti Nero (cuttlefish ink), Creamed Codfish and Polenta, and the Sole.",5,Siena,New York Area
"this is one of our favorite restaurants in NY. The food is superb, and the atmosphere very friendly!",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"A couple of friends went to Bacaro a few weeks before we arrived in NYC. I thought it looked cool, so I made some reservations for my wife and myself along with another couple who went on our trip with us.  After trying to find the place (which looks like it's in a horrible neighborhood, but surprisingly, we didn't run into any problems), they weren't too happy with my choice. They complained the whole time up until we received our food. After that, they thought the food was great. It wasn't pricey at all, but it had the sense of a really nice upscale restaurant.",4,Beanjug,New York Area
"What a find! Real Venetian cuisine on the outer fringes of Chinatown! The neighborhood is a bit run down, and the restaurant is hard to find (no sign outside), but once you're in, what an experience! The downstairs is a romantic, candle-lit, brick cellar with arches, and the cuisine is the real deal. Great experience all around.",5,Fabulous,Washington DC
My favorite restaurant in New York! Enchanting medieval atmosphere A hidden treasure! Loved it!,5,Cdrocco,New York Area
"I have been to Bacaro (pronounced, by the way with the accent on the first syllable) twice. The first time the place was packed. The food, while excellent was expensive, and the noise level was tremendous - eating in the basement felt just like that; eating in a crowded basement. I did not enjoy the experience. However, there are so few good restaurants in my immediate area that are not crowded and noisy, that I decided to go there with a friend the other night. It was less crowded, the noise level was much reduced, the food was still excellent and while expensive, was more in keeping with what I have experienced in other NYC restaurants of equal or lesser quality. I had exactly the same table as I had the last time, and it was wonderful.",4,Donaldcabaker,New York Area
"What a neighborhood gem this is. Food was excellant, and well priced. Loved the ""cellar"" dinning room, very quaint. Staff was great, and provided good tips on what to order and what was ""sharable"".",4,ATLGAL,New York Area
"I came here on a recommendation from a friend. SO glad I did! I brought my fiance here for his birthday and he was pleasantly surprised by the taste and quality of all the food. And a big bonus, the prices were extremely reasonable. More than reasonable actually. Our server, Regis, was wonderful as well.  The olive oil served with their bread was amazing; strong, fragrant and delicious. The fiance also couldn't get enough of their bread... so yummy. If you like snails, you must order their baked snail appetizer. Ridiculously tasty. If you don't like snails, you should get it anyway. It just might convert you. Our entrees: spaghetti vongole and marinated steak... NO complaints there!  Thank you, Bacaro, for making the birthday dinner a h",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"We went for my wife's birthday with a group of 5. The restaurant is really small and cozy, but the staff was very accommodating. They are very used to birthday celebrations. The food is high quality and reasonably priced. They did not rush us and let us bring our own birthday cake. The pasta dishes were very good. The menu had some flair but not pretentious like many restaurants these days. I do not need to know that the pork belly came from a pig named Bill. The grilled pulpo was perfect. Only complaint: Since the tables are small, do not serve the meals straight from the skillet. Transfer them to plates and save some elbow room.",5,Runoto,Chicago
The restaurant kindly waited for us for 30min as we faced trouble of subway and delayed.  Very good Italian tastes and Friendship .,3,SATOSHI,London
Dominic was a great waiter and the energy and entire staff were simply fantastic. The food was spot on in taste and texture. I could close my eyes and be in Sicily.,5,BigD,Raleigh
Had to leave before we could eat because the table where they sat us was so uncomfortable. Probably should have been a table for two (I think they may have brought in a table from outside to accommodate four). Since we were so close to the door it was also freezing.,1,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Fantastic service. Great food. Fun time.,5,OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 2, 2018"
"Any place that makes their own pasta, has lots of specials, and is not too pretentious is worth a visit, and this place fit all those bills. It's a small little spot with only about ten tables, making it cozy, but not too cramped. Also, as a note of distinction, all their pasta dishes (and many others) are served in a small sauce pot. It's a nice touch. Prices are reasonable, especially since they make it themselves. It's worth a try if you are in the neighborhood.",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Amazing Italian food. Great service, great atmosphere.",5,Cody,New York Area
"First off let me start off by saying the food was amazing.  For apps we ordered the calamari and it was perfect to share for three. I was very impressed with the variety of pastas they had, not only on the menu but the specials as well. The pasta was fresh (pretty sure it was made in-house) and flavorful and served in creative iron cast pans. Definitely will be going back until I try All the pastas on the menu!!!",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Always great food, friendly staff, a pleasure to dine here.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
My mum’s birthday,5,OpenTable Diner,Miami
Pasta was extremely salty. Prawns were bad! We had a stomic flew in the morning after. Not value for money at all.,2,OpenTable Diner,Montreal
I had a great time at Piccola Cucina. I must say if you do decide to come on a first date here the music is quite loud and you need to do a bit of shouting for your date to hear you. There isn’t a variety for you to choose from the menu if you're vegetarian. Overall the place is really cute and they had great music.,4,Jocy,New York Area
"As Italian I can only say this is my favorite Italian restaurant ever! Very good food, super service and cozy atmosphere!",5,DeniseR,New York Area
"WOW! What a Find! This atmosphere was very intimate. All of their food was very authentic and delicious! They had a great wine list, along with a drink menu. The staff was awesome and fun. The prices were very reasonable for the quality of food. Can't wait for my next trip to Piccola Cucina!",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The staff were very nice and extremely attentive; however, the food was bad. My wife found several completely raw pieces of pasta in her dish and the eggplant was unable to be found by either of us. My dish was ok, but it was nothing special. The other big issue was that the tables were so cramped that anytime the people sitting around us needed to get up, we would have to move our table and hold onto our stuff so that it didn't get knocked over.",1,OpenTable Diner,Richmond
"We enjoyed an absolutely wonderful experience at Piccola Cucina Osteria.  Yes, it is tiny, crowded, and noisy, but it's all part of the experience.  The food was absolutely terrific--arancini as good as we have had, and brilliant, bright and flavorful pastas.  The wait staff does a great job in conveying an authentic Italian feeling to the place.  We will look forward to coming back.",5,Danar,New England
Very tiny restaurant. Amazing food!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"My favorite Italian restaurant in NYC - actually it may be my favorite restaurant, anywhere. We go several times a year and are never disappointed. In fact, we are consistently surprised that every time the food seems better than the last. Linguini Neri is authentic and really quite amazing. Best I've had. Stuffed zucchini blossoms were outstanding.  Staff is great, attentive but not overbearing.  We took our friend for her birthday and afterwards she said it was her new ""death row dinner"". Can't get a better review than that.",5,OpenTable Diner,Philadelphia
"The best spot I could take my girlfriend for a romantic 21st bday. Reasonable price and the candles were perfect with the wine, which made it as romantic as it get. This spot is very underground and made me think but once Walked down, I was impress. It's a must go and customer service was great and even though the food wasn't a wow but the setting accomadtes for it.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
The black spaghetti was spetacular!!! A real romantic place with a very good food!,5,Romeu,New York Area
"One of the coolest spaces, a dining catacomb on the fringe of Chinatown and LES. Super nice and friendly staff. Delivered us a complimentary glass of Proseco for our anniversary. Food is good, a little rich for my taste. But the ambiance and staff are what makes the place.",4,Mtizzle,New York Area
"The ambiance is wonderful and the food was delicious: but both times I've gone, the waiter rushed us along during the meal. It's SO close to being a great restaurant, but with a waiter that pushy, I would never recommend it as a date spot. The waiter single-handedly killed the mood! They were in such a rush to get us out of the restaurant that they re-set the table with new settings, water glasses, etc before we'd even finished signing the check!",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The food was excellent (especially, the olive oil that came with bread). However, only one thing I didn't like about this place was the music, which didn't really match the very classic ambiance... I know it used to be different",4,Sara,New York Area
cool space - amazing food and great service - dinner was fantastic,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The restaurant was nice in the lower level, however the food was not outstanding and nothing to rave about to friends. Dessert was ok and so was the main courses. The restaurant has a romantic vibe and it's cute for a first date. However I would not return.",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The candles, rustic interior and wonderful food made for an amazing dinner experience.",4,EricJP,New York Area
"The place is very nice but the food used to be really good and now is not as good anymore. I am italian born and raised in the north, from the region where Bacaro's food is originating so my expectations are pretty high to begin with. Nonetheless, this is the first time sinc eopening that I notice a deterioration in the food quality; service was...nothing special really. Pity, it was one of my favorite restaurants for itaian food!",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Very cool place on the lower Lower East Side. Would definitely go back again with group or date.,4,sanj,New York Area
"This place is the absolute definition of a hidden gem! There is nothing on the street other than Bacaro, and even Bacaro is hard to spot! My cab driver didn't believe there was anything on Division Street, he insisted on taking me to Stanton:-) I didn't let him. The restaurant is super romantic, and each table has its own special nook. You feel very removed from the city sitting in the charming, candlelit like basement. The menu was outstanding, I wish I could have tried everything. Definitely order the meat and cheese plate to start!",4,JS94,New York Area
"Great restaurant on border of LES &amp; Chinatown. Nice atmosphere for downstairs dining area - lots of exposed brick &amp; iron work with plenty of candlelight. Huge list of Italian wines, waitress was great in helping us pick out wines. Good choices on the menus, food was delicious.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Very dumpy neighborhood in Chinatown/Lower East Side, but a true gem. Would have given them perfect score, but for a mixup in an order. But they truly were tremendous, and we will return. The setting for the tables is one of the most romantic I have ever seen, and the food was fantastic and very innovative.",4,MichaelK,Washington DC
"Unusual finding a restaurant like this on the Lower East Side. We went to a great gallery opening (Bosi), and we were looking for a place nearby. We found Bacaro, and we were pleasantly suprised at the professional service, inventive food, and reasonable wine list. We would go back.",5,Nola,New York Area
"I read reviews of this place and it was just as it was described in all the reviews. Food was excellent, love the candles for a romantic feel. Great for dates and big groups as well. One thing I would have liked was if the 2 seat tables would've been a bit further apart from the next, I didn't want to hear what others are talking about or seeing there eyes wonder over, made it kinda of uncomfortable sometimes during dinner. Other than that....4 stars, love the food!!",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Showed up 30 minutes early intending to grab a drink at the bar before hand but was given to option to sit down immediately which was nice. Ambiance was great. Food was very affordable and delicious. Wine list was very robust. I would go back.,5,GC102,New York Area
"This place is quite romantic. The downstairs dining area is all candlelit which does mean you might have to bring the menus up to the candle if your eyesight isn't that good, but it makes for an extremely romantic setting.  Started off with the stuffed Artichoke appetizer which is large enough for two people to share. The artichoke was very very tasty. Then I ordered the wheat pasta with duck ragu which was superb. A little bit of a smaller portion size than I had anticipated, but tasty enough that I could overlook that. Only true negative I have about the dish was that the pasta was slightly under-cooked; and that's coming from someone who likes pasta al dente.  The waiters were extremely attentive and friendly.  Overall, excellent",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

Surprisingly delicious! We loved it!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
I found this teeny tiny place on Open Table - made reservations and when 2 different sets of NY friends heard - they said - thats the one place we would have told you to go to!!  It was wonderful and we had a fantastic meal - not a complaint from one of the 4 of us.  The arancini balls were so good - some of the best ever. The pastas were cooked to perfection! If you like really good Italian food - this is the place.  One word of caution tho - you have to like people as the tables are very close and you do get to know your neighbors in a wonderful and friendly way.  This place only seats about 35 people.  I wouldn't miss it and would definitely go back.,5,Fiona,New England
"VERY small and tight restaurant.  The food was ok, very salty.",3,KenK,New York Area

Great for a fun night out or when you just need some home cooked italian goodness. Extremely impressed!",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
It was Christmas Day very small but servers were happy and a pleasure to be with. Authentic Italian food.,4,Pleased,New York Area
"We had an amazing time!! We went for Christmas dinner and even though the restaurant was jam packed, the service was great and each dish was more delicious than the last. This restaurant is so authentic, the food is served just like it would be in Italy. The pastas are fantastic. Two people at our ordered the branzino and said it was the best that they had ever had.  I highly recommend the involtini appetizer, we ordered a second one because it was that good. The whole experience, being that it was a holiday, made it feel like we were home or at a party with family. This place is at the top of my list of best Italian in NYC. Can't wait to go back and try some other selections on the menu",5,candicaneadventures,New York Area

I LOVE this place. Slightly out of the way but that's what makes it feel like a hidden gem. Amazing dishes and very good value. We always take guests here because it makes them feel like they're in on a special nyc foodie secret.,4,Lahu,New York Area
Second visit to Bacaro. Love the cocktails and food. Will definitely be back again.,3,OpenTable Diner,London

"A delicious and pleasant dining experience. Very nice, varied menu, great wine list. We will definitely return and recommend!",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The ambiance of this restaurant is it's best feature...a romantic, candle-lit, sunken grotto with tables tucked into semi-private nooks and crannies. We almost missed the restaurant from the outside as there are no signs displaying the name anywhere. Service and food were good, and the prices were reasonable. My two complaints regarding food were that the (very tasty) bread that was brought to our table seemed to have been refrigerated and was therefore tough, and my pasta with clams had a lot of empty clam shells. Unfortunately the missing clams were not to be found anywhere in the pasta.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"We were there on Sunday, Oscar Awards night so it wasn't busy and 70% of the tables were empty. Our waitress was unfriendly and didn't give us time to look over the menu. We ordered our drinks and glanced at our menu and decided our appetizers. We tried to place our order but was told our order was incomplete and the kitchen could only process complete orders ie. entree orders as well. If this was their policy she could have given us aheads up. When our appetizers came-the order wrong and she was quick to add the correct dish to our order for an additional charge and didn't take away the incorrect item. We said no thank you we will leave it as. She only come to the table to sell us more drinks and give us our bill. Bad experience.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"If romance is what you're after...one would be hard pressed to find a better spot...that is once you find Bacaro itself! Hidden (almost literally) in Chinatown...this sunken cavern delights diners with its quiet catacombs lit by dim bulbs and candlelight, exposing brick walls and cozy seating areas that make for a wonderfully romantic evening. The wait staff is friendly and attentive without being intrusive and the Northern Italian fare consists of several creative, tasty dishes. However, it's the ambiance that is the real star here.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
My girlfriends and I enjoyed dinner together on Saturday night. It was the perfect place for the 4 of us. Great ambiance and energy but allowed us to chat and enjoy our time privately. Our waitress and the staff were great and attentive (minus the busser who fit my friend with a plate). Great experience!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"What an unexpected but delightful find on a nondescript Chinatown street! I had a wonderful time here the other night. The food was everything an Italian dinner should be. A little out of the way, but highly recommended.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I was bummed . After reading reviews on this place i was excited to try this place out. Maybe its because im italian but i didnt find the food to be authentic tasting at all. I got the stuffed artichoke and spicy meatballs, it wasnt amything i couldnt make myself. i must say though, the service &amp; gnochi was great.",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The food and the downstairs dining area were really good. The only thing that threw me off is that, although I reserved a table for two well in advance, there was no indication that some of the tables were communal. There is hardly anything more awkward than sharing what is supposed to be an intimate, romantic date for two with the strangers directly across the table. I was also not able to figure out why some people got seated at two-tops and others at communal tables. As a Valentine's Day date spot, I would never suggest this place to anyone.",2,LeahS,New York Area
"Dinner was fantastic, so were appetizers, but both desserts were ordered were subpar. Will definitely go back, and skip dessert!",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I love(d) Bacaro. You would be pressed to find better gnocchi anywhere. That being said.... I made a reservation 6 WEEKS in advance for Valentines Day for 7pm (early by NYC standards.) When we arrived, we were taken to the furthest corner of the basement and wedged between two other couples. (Passing MANY other empty suitable seatings for two along the way.) I have heard of communal dining, but this situation was truly ridiculous. We were then given a table upstairs near the bar (our request for an alternate downstairs table was denied.) It was UNACCEPTABLE, so we left. Suffice it to say, this put a HUGE damper on Valentines Day. (I should also add that I NEVER write bad reviews of restaurants.) DON'T RELY ON BACARO.",1,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Food was too salty. Didn't care for patrons entering and exiting from basements to smoke as it made for cold draft when opened.,3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

This little east village italian restaurant is amazing. Very well priced. Extensive wine list. The staff are very friendly and helpful. the interior is best described as a candle lit den.  A great spot for a quiet dinner with friends or a couple. The champagne belini cocktail is my staple every time i go there. If the zucini flowers are on the specials list - then i highly recommend too!,4,OpenTable Diner,London
"A surprise awaits you as soon as you enter the door. Walk a candlelit path to your table downstairs and you are mmediately impressed with the beautifully laid out tables and rustic charm. Servers are prompt and courteous. And, the food is delicious. Cuddle fish ink sauce over whole wheat linguini was memorable. The stuffed artichoke appetizer was a nice treat. Can wait to go back.",5,MrCPW,New York Area

"I am vegan and celiac (strictly gluten free) and it can be difficult to find a nice restaurant where I can eat with my non-vegan, non-celiac family.  Candle Cafe's offerings were delicious. I highly recommend them. They are very aware of food allergies and it is clear that awareness is shared by the kitchen.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

"Never disappointed at Candle Cafe West. Had dinner with a cousin who had never eaten at the restaurant. She loved it. Shared guacamole, chimmichuras, rolls and a salad.  All delicious!",4,Lori,New York Area
Love the options and the presentation of this very good food.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"A bit disappointed by the quality of the food. I wish they’d simply double down on putting veggie at the center and make it shine vs. doing a bunch of meat dish imitations. Portions were huge, too many ingredients - yet surprisingly bland, and overpriced for what you get. Dining room is one of the nicer ones on the UWS, service was great.",3,FrequentDiner,New York Area
The host graciously changed the table so that I could sit on the banquet.  The specials looked inviting and when they came they were exactly as written.  The  wines by the glass were excellent.  The apple crumb dessert w/ ice cream was delicious.   The best part for us was that the restaurant was full yet QUIET.  We could talk without shouting.  This has become a rarity in NYC.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Good service and very interesting and varied menu for vegetarians.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The ambience is beautiful, the service attentive and kind.  The food was lovely, tastefully prepared and arranged, delicious.  This is our favorite restaurant.  We met several friends for a special birthday, asked for quiet away from the door, and were accomodated in a pretty little area, behind us  decorative blackboard with a thought about respect for life.  We loved being here.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

Pleasant place to eat.  Good vegan options. Food and presentation is good,4,Susan,New York Area
"Fantastic vegan food, great variety of flavors and textures.",5,OneWhoEats,Philadelphia
"Delicious, nutritious and love the planet-icious. My daughter raved about the pancakes and was inspired to make vegan dishes of her own. The artichoke-olive-bean appetizer, black bean soup and daily vegetables were fantastic as well. All in all, Candle is a bright light in the dining landscape.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"We came here on a Saturday afternoon. The restaurant was pretty much empty. Servers were short staffed and took a while to come, table didn't have all the menus. But Food was great!!! Overall good, and will go back :)",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

Candle West is consistently a wonderful treat!! BEST vegan restaurant on the UWS and non vegans LOVE it too!,5,UWSVegan,New York Area
It was a wonderful date night. The food was extraordinary and the atmosphere was fantastic. It was the first time that I went to this restaurant. It is wonderful to know that there is a restaurant in the Upper West Side that is vegetarian/vegan. It is so difficult to find restaurants that have vegetarian or vegan options.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Incredibly delicious food. Even non-vegans will appreciate their meal at Candle.,5,OpenTable Diner,Philadelphia
"Fast and friendly service. Very thoughtful and willing to accommodate special food requests. Delicious, vegan food!",5,OpenTable Diner,Northern MI
"I’ve been a fan of this group for a long time. This was my first time at this location and it lived up to all of my expectations. Everything was perfect. The only thing I would change is my table’s location. I was sat directly next to the door, which was not ideal, but that’s an easy fix for next time",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"It's always a good meal at  Candle Cafe West.  Imaginative vegetarian and vegan food and desserts, and delicious liquid tonics both with and without alcohol.",4,btwasthere,New York Area
"The food meets the high standards of both the Candle Cafe on the East side and Candle 79. Anyone seeking creative, good quality vegan food in a casual atmosphere will not be disappointed.  The presentation is lovely, the food tasty, and the ambience warm and casual.  However, the overall  menu is weighted a little heavy with seitan dishes  which are not healthy for gluten-free eaters. Perhaps a greater variety of various bean dishes would improve this dilemma.",4,Saralyn,New York Area
The food was as delicious and creative as I remember from my last visit. Totally satisfying - excellent. Service was warm and attentive. All the way around a great experience.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Food was great, the staff attentive, and the noise level just the way I like it: quiet, so the four of us could hear each other.  Only one problem, a serious one, the bathroom was not accessable to one of us who could not manage the stairs on her own, even though the restaurant claims to be handicap accessable.",4,Nanyc,New York Area
"We've been to this place numerous times. My girlfriend is a vegetarian and I'm not. I can always find something wonderful to eat. This is one of our favorite vegetarian places in NYC. Delicious food, great service, beautiful surroundings.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I have dined at Candle Cafe West many times, generally without much enthusiasm--mostly I've agreed to meet friends there because it is very convenient to where I live. This was the last time, however. I sent back my meal (mushroom-crusted tofu) and did not re-order, having lost my appetite. It was, in a word, tasteless glop. My dining companion ate half of her entree (vegetable curry cake), and forgot to take the doggy bag (there was a reason for that). I've been a vegetarian for fifty years and especially in NYC,  there is no excuse for food so utterly lacking in vibrancy and taste.",1,Katriel,New York Area
"This is one of my favorite restaurants. The food is delicious. The staff is pleasant. I have nothing negative to say about it. I’ve been here before, and I’ll be back again.",5,Iwasthere,New York Area
Uninspired burrito but the other things we ordered were good and the service was excellent.,5,Melia,New York Area
It took over 50 minutes for the entree. That is all,3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"1. 2 of us arrived early and wanted to have a few drinks/appetizers at the bar before heading to the table. The waitress said we can't bring our drinks to the table because we paid for a table and they want to promote the bar. We said we would eat some apps at the bar. We ordered our happy hour drinks at the bar and the bartender asked if we wanted nuts, before we can say yes, a different lady said, ""No. They don't get nuts. They have a table."" It was VERY rude. As customers/patrons of the restaurant, I want to say yes or no if I want to eat something. Don't cut me off and say I cant have food. That's not good customer service. We felt extremely unwelcome. The bar was empty at this point and we would have bought more drinks and food while waiting. Why didn't you just seat us at the bar to wait instead of at the table where we can't even drink?  2. We came for a friend's birthday. The dessert came out with a candle, which was nice, but they didn't sing Happy Birthday! It was odd. We weren't ready and missed out on a good photo opportunity.   3. The food was good, but the staff was worse. The waitress took forever to take our order. Mind you, we didn't eat anything at the bar.",3,Shari,New York Area
"Candle West was AMAZING! It is one of our family's favorite restaurants--and although of the five of us, only two are vegan, everybody always leaves happy and full. The seasonal cranberry tofu with potato gratin was a standout, as was the pumpkin pie. The hard cider is also delicious! Also recommended: The Indian chickpea cake, the seitan cheeseburger, and the ravioli.",5,OpenTable Diner,Miami
Overall wonderful.,5,Blayne1123,Birmingham
"My wife and I were visiting NYC for Thanksgiving weekend and were excited to find Cadle Cafe West for Thanksgiving dinner. As vegans, we are used to making do with very limited vegan options. We were provided with a number of options for appetizer, salad, soup, entree, and desert. Each serving was a generous size and very unique and flavorful. The only downside to the meal was that we ate way too much.  My wife and travel extensively and eat out often. In the six years we have been vegan, we have never had a more fine vegan meal anywhere. Unquestionably, we will be back.",5,OpenTable Diner,Tampa
"Overall, the best of the Candle Cafes in NYC! Fantastic food.",5,Haas,New York Area
"I absolutely love Candle Cafe, the nachos are one of my favorite dishes that I rarely get anymore due to food allergies - SO GOOD. The service is usually very slow so make sure to give yourself plenty of time in order to have a good experience.",4,katezoo,New York Area
"Candle East is a better option all around.  This UWS option was way overpriced and the food simply lacked taste and imagination.  Guests are really paying for ambiance, and very dearly.",2,anoneyes,New York Area
Great!! Excellent selection and tasty drinks,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Nix is one of my favorite restaurants  to take my non-vegan friends too. They offer two menus, Vegan and Vegetarian, and my non veg friends always leave stating if they could cook like the chef at Nix they would be vegan/vegetarian too!",5,Beckwoman,New York Area
"The food was excellent as always, the ambiance very pleasant and the service was also very good except that they didn't do anything in reference to my boyfriend's birthday even though I let them know from the time I made the reservation that we were going to be celebrating this special occasion and I reminded them when I arrived at the restaurant.  That was a bit disappointing, especially since they assured me they had noted down the occasion when I came in.",4,RocioC,Dined 4 days ago
"Amazing food, friendly and flawless service. Highly recommended.",5,CatherineB,Dined 5 days ago
It is so good I eat here on each trip to NYC.  They need better signage.  I know exactly where it is but almost always walk right past it.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"NIX is amazing!  I am not a vegetarian. I generally think vegetarian restaurants are inferior in taste to those without such limitations to their ingredient lists. I generally find vegetarian restaurants try and fail to make alternate versions of meat dishes, that are shadows of their original dish.  NIX is different and superior. Its by far the best vegetarian restaurant I have eaten at, and more importantly, it is one of the best restaurants I have eaten at, period. I would recommend it to any and all purely for the great cuisine they offer with the bonus of ambiance and service.  In my mind the accomplish this by creating unique cuisine designed around the ingredients versus finding ingredient substitutes for formerly meat dishes. Every dish we had was a powerful unique experience of flavor and texture.  I greatly look forward to my next visit!",5,LordBritish,New York Area
We were expecting more tasty food. We felt like the food was pretty basic and yet expensive. The ambience is certainly good and the service is also good though.,3,OpenTable Diner,Las Vegas
Love Nix! Such creative food for a vegetarian diner. Have now tried dinner and brunch. Everything is delicious!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
I just asked them to bring me the most delicious food on the menu. And they did. :),5,OpenTable Diner,Raleigh
"Good quality, especially the main course and appetizers. Light fare solid.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
My daughter and I were confused by the high ratings. The food is a not particularly flavorful and the service was a bit awkward and lacked warmth.,2,Terski,Chicago
Went to Nix twice in a week. Tried their dinner and lunch menu both were great! Excellent service :),5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Our new favorite vegan/vegetarian restaurant in the city! So close to Union Square, it's going to be our go-to for pre-movie dining!  The food was fantastic, and our waitress was so helping in choosing the best of the best courses.  So much fun.  Will def be back!",5,FoodieMom,New York Area
Blown away by our meals. You won't be unhappy here with their amazing vegan options (even if you're a meat-eater). We'll be back!,5,OpenTable Diner,Philadelphia
"This place is FANTASTIC and saved me!!! I had to impress a foodie vegetarian friend and this place did not disappoint. She was amazed by the high quality and taste of every dish. The food was absolutely incredible, with many great choices. If I could eat like this every day, I would be a vegetarian in a heartbeat. Absolutely, the best vegetarian restaurant in NYC. Don't go elsewhere. Go here.",5,ultramet,New York Area
The restaurant was quiet and nice. The food was a few bucks overpriced for what it was. I found mine to be in need of salt which they do not provide on tables. Additionally it was just way more expensive than comparative restaurants which provide more value. I think if they dropped the price from $20 for cauliflower to 16 they would still make money but provide better value. Spent about $40 bucks on dinner and got some tempura cauliflower and a half an avocado with sesame seeds and garlic aioli. There is just better value elsewhere in this big city. Even for vegetarians.,3,Foodie,New York Area
"The food here is absolutely scrumptious. For reasons we don’t quite understand, there was an unusually long lag between our first and second courses, which made the end of the meal quite rushed. Otherwise a perfect choice!",4,Elisa,New York Area
"We did call Nix in advance who did think well in advance that they were offering a Restaurant Week menu. They were not in fact. Nonetheless, we tried the three different dips with the bread. We tried  interesting chewy dumplings and delicious cauliflower tempura dishes. Everything was colorful, tasty and hearty. My only criticism is that both of us found the selections a tad heavy. This was surprising. I think next time we would ask for more guidance in the selections.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
We always love it at Nix at the rail tables!,5,Villagehaunts,New York Area
"Although the food was excellent, we definitely felt as though we were rushed to eat and leave. Our food came out super fast, was removed immediately and the next course served right away. It was not a relaxed environment that encouraged us to relax and enjoy our time there. Considering the cost of the meal, it was an incongruity",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"On this, our second dinner at Nix, my wife ordered badly, as she had the first time. She wasn't happy with any of her dishes. I ordered well for the most part, and liked my food. But I tasted her servings and agreed with her assessments. We won't be back.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"From a friendly welcome to a cordial thank you, and everything in between, this was a great experience.  We shared the three dips which were luscious, the  fried cauliflower pockets, slightly spicy, cooled by a smooth  sauce, the lemon dessert .... all unique and delicious. Along with good service and a great design, this made for a lunch place that we'll want to return to many times.",5,Delicious,New York Area

We took our out of town friends for Sunday brunch to this restaurant. We really enjoyed both vegan and vegetarian dishes and got to try interesting combinations. Deserts were very good and brunch cocktail menu was on point.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
The food was amazing. I LOVED what I had to eat!!! I was a little disappointed that a baby behind us was screaming bloody murder and the parents wouldn’t go outside or to the bathroom...but that’s just bad parenting and not a reflection of the restaurant. Lol,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I recommend you find out why the restaurant is named ""Nix""!  It's a great find; Michelin Star; very happy with our experience. They topped our desert with a sparkler unbeknownst to my wife or me as we were celebrating our 10-yr wedding anniversary.",5,PunditofFunk,Philadelphia
"Everything we ordered was delicious. The food was super creative and wonderful. My friend and I went for lunch and were blown away. It was late so restaurant was quiet, but they couldn’t have been nicer. Can’t wait to go back!",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Excellent menu, delicious creative vegetarian cuisine from one of the best in NYC, John Fraser. Casual well informed service. Our first time at Nix, we will be back!",4,finefoodie,New York Area
"Incredible food!! Didn't for a moment feel like it was a 'vegetarian' restaurant (in a good way). Very reasonably priced for the quality of food. I highly recommend it. The naan and dips were out of the world, as was the baked sweet potato covered with truffle shavings.",5,Meeks,New York Area
"While the food was outstanding (everything we ordered elicited a reaction of pure joy), the birthday dinner (with reservations) we planned for a friend ended on a sour note when we were pressured to leave. We had 3 different people come over in 5 minutes to see if there was ""anything else...?"" we needed as we were finishing dessert, and our final ""no, we're all set!"" was met with the check being plunked down, and 3 more staff members coming to clear plates and wipe crumbs off the table. We paid our bill right away, and as we were taking turns to run to the bathroom before heading out (as the table was being re-set under our elbows) the hostess assured the next guests that we were ""JUST LEAVING"" and their table ""WILL BE READY IN A MINUTE."" This was not said quietly; it was shouted as she turned to face us while we scrambled for our coats. Not a fun way to end a special birthday dinner. Too bad, because the food really is a delight.",3,UWSgirl,New York Area
"not horrible, but the food was just... meh. service was inattentive. i've had better vegetarian meals for less money elsewhere.",3,name,Philadelphia
"My partner and I went. It was his birthday and I know he's very particular, so right away I appreciated the clean, sleek, and not overdone look of the place. Can't recall if there was background music or not but that did not matter, as the sound of the diners was one that comforted, as it's the ambient noise of people enjoying their food, and that's the best! Oh, and the food was awesome, that cauliflower tempura is the business!",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"More than a meal, the serving style makes it into a full experience to share with the people you're with. Really hearty and filling food, even for a meat eater, but never too much - we had just the right amount. It's pricey but not insane, and the quality is out of this world.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Love the food at NIX!!! Everything we ordered was amazing. The service, however, left a lot to be desired. It was horrible. We were basically ignored once we were seated and the wait staff did not check on us during our meal.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Marvelous food and great atmosphere! Service is outstanding - our server knew everything about this food and gave us great suggestions. Definitely coming back again.,5,KonstantinW,New York Area
Perfect up market veggie restaurant in the village. We chose well but still got jealous of other people’s food around us so must go back soon to try it all! Small intermate restaurant ideal for a couple or group of 4. Wonderful service.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Main courses excellent but we did not like the appetizers at all. They were all a little strange. However the desserts are quite good especially the olive oil ice cream.,3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Super Bowl night so very quiet. Octopus appetizer was awful, no taste and dry rubbery octopus. Beets with pistachios was better, but also pretty bland. Pizza Quattro Formagi was okay. Crispy crust, but not great. The service was good. Probably because it was so quiet. I had been here years ago, and it was much better then.",3,ASMA,New York Area
Love the man behind the bar!!,5,jamienyc,New York Area
"Our server was great, very friendly and competent.  The spinach salad was very tasty. Unfortunately, the pizza (Margherita) was really bad. We just ate it because we were really hungry.",3,Svenja,Dined 6 days ago

"Alana, the wine manager/Sommelier was fantastic.  She gave us 2 outstanding recommendations that paired really well with our food.  Our waiter was also really attentive.  I was a little disappointed in the pizza, but the pasta and veggies were delicious and the cheese plate for dessert was the perfect ending to the meal.",4,LocalFoodie,New York Area
I called ahead and requested a birthday candle for our table to be brought out during dessert. The waitress did not follow thru and I was extremely disappointed singing happy birthday with no candle in any of our desserts. Hostess and waitress need to coordinate special requests.,4,Kristina,Washington DC
"Price of wines by the glass, drinks, and beer was ridiculous— wine by the bottle list was way too long and unreadable -  Service was ok but not very friendly nor helpful in providing recommendations. Overall, a forgettable experience.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
An overall good experience.  The food portions can be larger.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Cacio pepe pizza is the best pizza you will ever have!,5,kris,New York Area
"Otto has great food and cocktails - everything was delicious. The downside the to the evening was the service. We had an 8:45 reservation, and the waitstaff obviously just wanted to get out of there (although there were a good two dozen tables with diners when we entered and many still there when we left).   First, we were placed at a terrible table when there were many other better tables available. It requires one of us to squeeze in behind a door.   Second, someone came by and from a distance of about three feet away literally tossed a bag of breadsticks and some wrapped up bread. No offer to provide olive oil or butter - just plain bread.   Third, we ordered and enjoyed the food, but they rushed out the main course two minutes after dropping off appetizers.   The food was great, but we were rushed in and out of there in thirty minutes. If I wanted a fast-food experience, I’d go somewhere else.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Food and service can’t be beat!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Great food! Great service! Awesome wine list! A little loud if you’re looking for a quiet place. But other than that great ambience very lively.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

Very disappointed in the meal and the food.  New Years dinner was much better in every eThis is the last time  I will of  go there with anyone. The sound level from people trying to talk over each other was hard to take.  J,2,Yackieoh,New York Area

Cacio pepe pizza is amazing!! Best pizza in tbe world!!,5,kris,New York Area
"This was my second time at Otto and I was less than impressed. The chopped Otto salad was not good - dressing and mix of ingredients was not pleasing. We also ordered the special black truffle pasta, which was fine - but didn't highlight the truffles very much. The pizza - goat cheese - was odd. Fine, but odd. The chunks of squash on top were huge, in comparison to the very thin pizza, making it an odd thing to eat. We ordered an apple dessert, which was fine. The coffee, however, was outstanding and the best part of the meal.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"This was some of the worst food I've ever eaten. Cheese pizza did the impossible - it tasted bad. The Pesto pasta, although covered in tons of sauce, tasted like absolutely nothing. Supermarket pesto would have been better tasting than this. Thoroughly disappointing and will not go back.",1,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

Great meal and excellent service. Salad and veggies were okay but the carbonara was spectacular. Excellent service and reasonably priced wines. Fun atmosphere for friends or a date.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Otto has been a go-to neighborhood restaurant for our family for many years because of its wonderful food, dependable menu, family-friendly ambience, lovely staff and great space. It’s been a gem! However, my wife and I were both of the opinion that the most fundamental reason for visiting any restaurant – the food – is no longer what it used to be at Otto.  Staples such as the Margherita Pizza, Soup of the day, etc. were disappointing. We’d hate for this wonderful restaurant to go but if this is what passes as representative of  what the kitchen has to offer (nowadays) then we won’t be back, and I can’t see how you’d could continue to cater to loyal and new clientele on the back of what was served to us. It wasn’t bad, but it wasn’t Otto good, which was its point of difference.",3,ElGuapo,New York Area
Overall great experience. Great food only Matched by the great service. Hmm ... can’t even think of a negative. We went midweek and it was not busy. Had a quiet table. Attentive staff. We will be back ...,5,OpenTable Diner,New England

"The place is nice and the service is ok, but I was expecting a little bit more in the food. The Menu describes very little, is confusing and there are no healthy choices. It was recommended to me for being a kids  friendly place but there is not really something especially made for kids.",3,OpenTable Diner,México
Wine choices are great and they let you try wines before you purchase.,3,THEOdeon2016,New York Area
Il posto è carino ed accogliente (buona selezione di vini) ed i piatti sembrano bueno ma se avete voglia di pizza (è quello che stavo cercando io) lasciate stare. Chissà non è la loro specialità però per un italiano (e non solo) la pizza è tutta un’altra cosa.,2,Edomoro,New York Area

The pizza's sauce tasted like tomato paste, and the goat cheese pasta was horrible. This was my second time in two years and definitely my last.",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

"It's one of my top 5 favorite restaurants in NYC. It has a great atmosphere, great food &amp; is very unique. Everyone I bring just loves it! It's beautiful &amp; eclectic inside. There are 2 bars so it's great for a pre dinner drink!  I love the stuffed zucchini flowers &amp; mushroom gnocchi, but I've never had a bad dish!",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
We LOVE Bacaro! The atmosphere is romantic and the vibe from fellow diners is electric. Wandering through the warren of little underground rooms with exposed brick and funky chandeliers is unique and gives a feeling of being in a grotto in Venice. It's fun to share a bunch of appetizers. The sauce on the razor clams begs for chunks of bread to be dipped and mopped up. It's savory and sensational. The fried oysters are always good. The risotto was creamy and cheesy and the shrimp with linguini was spicy and full of flavor. We all shared the lasagna which has a very smoky taste. The desserts are all delicious; we loved the rice pudding and the panna cotta but one night we had simple hazelnut gelato and it was perfect.,4,Foodlover14,New York Area
"this restaurant has decent food but their policy towards groups is insane, pretty fascist actually. They didn't want to sit us which I can understand (even thought the restaurant was almost completely empty) . And I wasn't told when I made the reservation on Open Table that we had to be out within 2 hours unless we took a table upstairs - why can't they give it to some other group coming later? I honestly have never heard of this at any other restaurant that I've been at. And we couldn't order more food after initial order unless it was just for dessert. They also need more waitstaff, she was clearly overwhelmed. I think expecting groups of 8 to be done in 2 hours sharp is just crazy, people linger. Bottom line, they are fascists.",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

My wife and I celebrated our 20th wedding anniversary here, and the restaurant lived up to its great reviews. Most of the tables are quite close to one another, so it's not the most private place for a date.

My wife and I found this restaurant available on a Saturday evening at the last minute before headed out the door. The food was very good and at a great price. We mostly had the specials (appetizers and main courses) and the smoked mozzarella lasagna was fantastic. The wine list was extensive and reasonable. The decor provides a great feel to the evening. My wife and I enjoyed it very much. The 80's music was a little off but did not bother us.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Different Italian food. Really enjoyed the modified Sicilian specialties.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
The space was very unique and beautiful. It was perfect for dining with a larger group. It's almost like having a private dining experience. The food was delicious. Not life changing but good. The service was also good. We had a lovely time. I would definitely go back.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Wasn't too impressed with the food. We probably ordered the wrong things - 3 fried appetizers and a leg of roasted pork.... The fried oysters were fishy with thick batter, the frog legs were fishy also - didn't taste like chicken - and the zucchini blossoms were okay - nothing too special - a burst of hot ricotta in your mouth.  Reasonably priced wine list. $30 On a Saturday night it took a while for people to arrive.",3,Tartuffa,Philadelphia
"Very good food. Quiet but lively. O.k. Service.....not very attentive, but not annoying.....had to look a while to find when paying the bill. But if that was the biggest problem it wasn't bad.",4,Rusty123,New York Area
The food was very good- and proportions just right. We were there when there were a few large groups- so the sound level became a little high.,4,terriek,New York Area
Having dinner at Bacaro is like visiting my favorite restaurants in Venice. It's so wonderful to find a restaurant in New York City that features Venetian cuisine.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

Server should be more attentive,3,OpenTable Diner,London
Recently had my birthday dinner here in one of their caves.  The food is always so fresh and delicious. The crab salad and frog legs to start were amazing and they have on of the best Spaghetti Vongole in town.I also recommend the flank steak.  Whatever they marinate it in or rub on is is mouth watering. My ownly complaints were that we had to get the waitress a bunch of times.  She could have come over to check on us more if we needed anything else but there was a large party next to us which could have made it difficult.. Also they were out of razor clams which are one of their signature dishes.  This really is such a hidden gem of the city.  I will be back  Great food and value.,4,NYCGEM,New York Area
"I cant give enough credit to the incredible staff working at this restaurant - not only did they make me and my wife feel like we were the only two people in the restaurant, the food was outstanding! I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone reading this little blog of mine....",5,Seth,New York Area
"I picked this restaurant for a good friend's birthday and it was wonderful. The food was delicious, reminded me of a home cooked meal. I had crab salad, the pork shoulder, and my friend had the filet of sole; seasoned and cooked well. The desserts were very tasty, great texture and flavors. Service was average, nothing spectacular at all, much room for improvement there (reason 4/5 instead of 5 out of 5). I would recommend this restaurant for a date, has a romantic vibe. Overall great experience.",4,Corinney,New York Area
"Food was great, hostess skills were not. Hostess had a horrible attitude and should make note to seat parties at appropriate sized tables, three people sitting at a round six top makes for a horrible dining experience. Especially when she said we couldn't move to a four top because all the four tops were reserved..? Really? When we were eating there were tables around us that were never even sat all night. So regretfully, because of the hostess, I will not be returning to a place that I had once enjoyed in the past.",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Amazing! The ambiance is perfect for a romantic date or for a group. It's such a hidden gem in Chinatown. Price is super affordable. We ordered the stuffed artichoke, Spaghetti Nero, and Pork shank on polenta. Yum. Yum. Yum. The cavernous basement is just lovely and I know where to go for my birthday this year! I'm just boggled why I only found out about this place now. Ah will surely be back.",5,OpenTable Diner,New England

The space at Sessanta is gorgeous!  The wine and first courses were divine.  Our pastas however were dry and overly salty.  Totally didn't expect that given how everything else was perfect.  Perhaps it was an off night.  Will try again.,3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Food is amazing! Ambiance is great! Overall 4 out of 5 because of bad service.,4,OpenTable Diner,London
Pasta was al dente.  Sauce was excellent.  Nice variety of offerings.  Noise level is near unbearable. Staff is friendly.  Appetizer portions leave a little to be desired.,3,John,Charleston
"Appetizers were delicious, special mention to the salad with baby beets, prosciutto.  Fritto  misto with shrimp OK, but not the raves I read about on Yelp.  Music too loud, could barely hear my dinner companion, got louder as evening progressed.  AC too high.  Wait staff attentive, very pleasant but the frequent interruptions by so many others besides our servers to ask repeatedly if everything was OK well meaning but over done and became tedious, they kept interrupting our conversation and didn't seem to realize someone else had just interrupted to ask same question - over and over.    Entrees not great - pork chop so fatty throughout and quite underdone, even though I like some marbleing of meat this was really fatty through and through and wasn't appetizing.  Friend's fish overdone.  Desserts excellent.    Overall uneven experience not sure if I would go again.",3,newyorker,New York Area
"Terrible food. Was so disappointed. Could barely eat anything we ordered. Great outdoor table. Lovely staff. A good scene. Loved the wine. Come for a drink, not a meal.",1,OpenTable Diner,Los Angeles
Go before the NYTimes or Siestema ruins this place with a great review.,5,Matt,New York Area
"We went to Sessanta for brunch on Labor Day and were disappointed with the unexciting brunch menu. Their website doesn't like their brunch/lunch menu and we were expecting something closer to their dinner menu which looks fantastic. The food was fine, just nothing special at all and boring. However the outdoor dining area is very pretty, quiet and there are outside speakers with low music playing in the background which was a nice touch. I will be back only to try dinner next time!",3,NYCFoodie,New York Area
"Beautiful restaurant. Good food but incredibly small portions. This is where restauranteurs don't get it. How do you expect consumers to go back when they feel cheated and ripped off. There are about 3,000 other Italian places serving good food and great portions so a $26 pasta dish with 3 bites just doesn't do it! And they wonder why they don't last long! Be fair, good value for $$ is the key. Don't mind high prices but make it memorable!",3,Mangan,New York Area
The Service is beyond impeccable. Staff is so knowledgeable - it actually brought us back to an old school New York when servers were on point. Refreshing to see there are still some amazing waiters left in NYC.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

Loved it! Food was yummy!!! We decided to eat at the bar and the bartenders are awesome. Look forward to returning.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Menu has lots to choose from that reminds one of the food of Sicily.  Pasta choices were excellent. The beef tongue sliders was a great way to start with a cocktail.  Nice wine list and space was inviting.   Although we ate inside the outdoor seating area looked great.,4,MaxGomez,New York Area
"Very very nice restaurant, even though we are used to Italian food and love it, this place was quite unique !",5,MariahR,New York Area

Polpette Di Maiale (Very Good) - Tuna Crudo (Good) - Lamb Belly (Very Good) - Schiaffuni Raviolo (Good) - Grilled Skirt Steak (Very Good)  Located on bottom floor of hotel - Solid Martini - Rather Quiet atmosphere that cleared out very quickly as the night went on - Overall solid place - Very Datey - Food was good,4,BTrotta,New York Area
"Sessanta really was n incredible experience. On top of consistent service, the general manager came over to our table several times and catered to every request in addition to going the extra mile with little details like joining another table to give us more space for our variety of small dishes, explaining each one etc. These simple gestures made a 3 person dinner of new friends all the more personable and intimate. But the food and wine is what really won us over. The lamb belly sausage was the standout amazing dish - so tender! Everything was really enjoyable. They ran out of the 2006 Amarone I requested but were kind and knowledgable about the wine, eventually recommending a superb Chianto Classico for about $80 that has to rank as one of the best I've ever had. A super value in my opinion. I think this restaurant has the perfect blend of trendy hot spot and old school Italian charm - I really hope that as a new restaurant the critics give it the reviews I believe it deserves.",5,Simon,New York Area
"While waiting at the bar, I had a Sardinia 75, a kiwi flavored version of a French 75 I assume. It was great. The bar wasn't full and the design of the dining room is stunning. My girlfriend and I shared meatballs and we both ordered the Busiate. Both were delectable. Our servers were prompt and polite.  My one complaint, we had an 8:30 reservation that we showed up 11 minutes early for only to be sat 15 minutes after our reservation. I'm in the biz and understand it happens, but it's an infraction nonetheless. Other than that dinner at Sessanta was a pleasant punctuation to an enjoyable night in the city.",4,Tyren,New Orleans
"A beautiful space matched perfectly by the dining experience. If possible arrive early and sit at the bar for a drink: so comfy and a great bartender. The waiter, somewhat difficult to understand, took us through the menu which is self explanatory and therefore unnecessary. We loved everything that we ordered. Suits  walk the room which was filled to overflowing by the time we left. Very few kinks for a newly opened restaurant, a credit to management that got the restaurant up and running so smoothly.",4,Bonnie,New York Area
"New opening, so still working through some kinks.    The Ambiance was nice, the services was OK, the food was nothing to brag about.    Maybe after things settle down a bit, they will get it right and then it can be something to rave about- but not there yet.",4,mfitzg1,New York Area

"Have been to Bacaro a number of times, and every meal has been excellent. Adore the atmosphere, staff, and food. A really special place in an unexpected location.",5,OpenTable Diner,Los Angeles
"It looks nice. A lot of good wines too. But all the food we had was surprisingly salty. Maybe, it is not the place to eat, but the place to have wine and chat.",3,Eater,Los Angeles
Bacaro is a great consistent neighborhood spot. I made a short notice 9PM Fri night reservation and as always it was busy but not annoyingly crazy. The bartender was top notch - customizing a drink for my friend and steering her away from her initial choice to a better match. The food is a bit inconsistent. I got the fillet of sole which is always light and delicious. The fried squash blossoms were perfectly prepared although the ricotta filling could have used some seasoning or inspiration. My friend had the gnocchi which were thick and dense - not as pillowy and delicious as on past visits. I'll probably stay away from them next time. Still Baraco is a perfect neighborhood spot - the kind that makes you glad to live in NY.,4,CANY,New York Area

"We had a fantastic dinner at Aunt Jake's! We had heard great things and wanted to see/taste for ourselves. Pasta is actually made in-house, you can see the pasta maker rolling and shaping the pasta at the counter. You can pick your shape of pasta and the sauce to accompany it, love the concept!  Had the beet salad to start, and the cavatelli with arrabbiata sauce as a main, both delicious - simple and full of flavor! Some of the other entrees on the table were gluten free rigatoni with the lamb ragu, and farfalle with broken meatball - all exquisite!  We'll be back soon!",5,MrsD415,New York Area

"Food was delicious, service not so great",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Food was absolutely delicious. Service was completely bizarre. Our reservation was at 9PM and the restaurant was still very busy but the waitstaff was acting as if the restaurant was already closed - laughing and joking with each other and not paying any attention to our table. We finished our appetizers before our bottle of wine, which we ordered as soon as we sat down, was delivered. Really weird experience but I am writing it off as a one time occurrence and would definitely go back for the delish food.",4,OpenTable Diner,New England
"Great find! Slightly understaffed is my only complaint. While waiting for a table we decided to get a drink at the bar. After waiting 20 minutes without even so much as eye contact made by the bartender we decided to call it quits and just wait to order a drink after we were sat. We had to ask our server twice to bring us water with our wine, but other than that the food was delicious! Great ambiance.",4,Biancaug,New York Area

Nice cozy atmosphere with good service and food,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"As soon as we sat down we ordered a drink. Had to request a new glass because it had lipstick on it. The new glass was so “well rinsed” that it was still wet, leaving a small puddle on the table. We were then repeatedly asked if we were ready to order. Within the first 10mins at least 5x by different staff. The starter, a beet salad, was fantastic. The pasta decent. The place started to get crowded and our service disappeared. We were given the wrong check even though we wanted to order desert. The tiramisu desert was inedible. We then received yet another incorrect check. Will never go back here.",1,Suzara,New York Area
The tables were very cramped. Good luck getting to or leaving your table without elbowing the people sitting next to you. Pasta was also very undercooked.,3,MichelleG,Baltimore

"Great evening at Aunt Jakes, food and service were stellar.  The Artichoke and avocado toast -what!! Best in the city. Sunday sauce with spaghetti absolutely a must. Service was good straight forward and attentive. Perfect neighborhood addition  whether dining early with the fam or a date later in the evening.",5,hallieberrygirl12,New York Area
"We have been to Jakes 3 times.   My only complaint is the very weak drink-(-Tanquerary martini up)  The pastas are fresh and  the option of choosing the shape and then the sauce provides interesting and creative options.   The portions are certainly hearty.  The apps are excellent as well.  The portion for one is easily shareable.  The avocado toast was delicious.   ALthough the clams in the clam sauce were littleneck size not the smaller cockles they were  freshly  prepared  excellent,  and ample. Glad we live in the neighborhood and can be here frequently!",4,downtowner,New York Area

"I ordered squid-ink pasta with clams. The clams were large and inedible. They were rubbery, and the entire dish was very over salted. I sent it back and ordered tagliatelle with marinara sauce. The sauce was tasteless. I asked for Parmesan, and received a tiny cup of pretend Parmesan. Awful. Finally, the waiter took our credit card after we barely ate our dinner and charged us for a different table.",1,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

"I had heard about Aunt Jakes, so decided to try it. It was ok, but wasn't anything special. The pasta was slightly too aldente and did not have enough sauce on it. I was underwhelmed. The chicken parm was good, though and so were the cocktails. For a party of 4 it was about $40 ish each including tip (for 2 appetizers, 2 pastas and chicken parm.. and 1 drink per person). Wouldn't rush back or recommend immediately, but was good ""enough"".",3,melb291,New York Area

"My business partner and I wandered in and were immediately taken with the room, the music and the vibe. Then the service was absolutely wonderful... friendly, personable and really helpful.

We will be back - again and again.",5,John238,Los Angeles
"We went on a Friday night for a late dinner reservation at 10pm. It was two couples, and they sat us at a nice table in the corner. We asked 3 servers (including our own) and the bartender for water. They kept telling us they were working on it. i don't know if they had to walk to a water well, but it took a good 30 minutes before we had any water. We had sake and our appetizers before we had water. The sake and the fried chicken were excellent. I would recommend this place for those items, but I would caveat the service.",3,Vandylexy,New York Area
Shigure is a modern Japanese restaurant.  I will definitely recommend the restaurant for both my Japanese and non-Japanese friends.,4,yasu,New York Area
"It was busy Friday night before the President's Day - with nice crowd I almost felt I was in the central Tokyo.  It is ""sake bar"" but the food here is so much better than some high-end Japanese restaurants. Their daily specials are super-fresh, seasonal, and of course real Japanese tastes. I would always try new dishes and never disappointed. Paired with great sake, I was in heaven! This is also a rare place you can eat Japanese food late night as the kitchen closes around 1:00 am. We stayed pretty late, but could catch a subway from Canal St Sta. nearby. It was soooo delicious &amp; happy Friday night.",5,HiroT,New York Area
"This little place is just south of Canal on Church and everything on the menu was delicious.  I have dined all over the world at countless Izakaya and the Tatsuta-age (fried chicken) at this place might be one of the best I've ever had.  The Beef tataki (rare seared beef) was just as good.  But a typical Izakaya (and to be honest, I'm not sure if that's what we can call this place) should have many more menu choices and that's what we wanted.  The sake, shochu and Japanese whiskey selection was tremendous. Maybe it's just a sake bar with great food...it's got Sakebar in the name after all.  But the potential for so much more is.......  Unless we lived around the corner, we would be hard pressed to come back for just the same menu.",3,Javatrader,New York Area
"The dishes here are quite authentic and flavorful, we felt like we were in Japan. The Washugyu Tataki was excellent, as was the white miso soup for two, the fried tofu, and smoked grilled mackerel. All were well presented nicely. The atmosphere was laid back, casual, and quiet, the decor was straightforward. I imagine the bar is busier later at night. Aesthetically it is cute but could be enhanced to be more attractive especially as you enter. The service was attentive and friendly. Overall we enjoyed our experience at SHiGure and will definitely return.",4,Traveler,東京
Low key and unpretentiously welcoming and very serious in it's devotion to sake. A good place to begin learning with tasty food to help one absorb the alcohol.,4,firstfoodie,New York Area
Great spot if you would like to dive into the world of saki,4,neville212,New York Area
"I'm Japanese and I have been there several times. The food is authentic Japanese with some modern twists, prepared with care by the Japanese chefs using the finest ingredients. Aji sashimi from daily specials I had last night was so fresh directly from Japan. I also had chef's signature menus like pork belly kakuni made from the first-class silky pork, homey atsuage tofu, SHiGURE salad with nappa and other vegetables, home made smoked salmon - all perfectly executed taking a very long time. So good to pair with the great sake and shochu selection. They have my favorite sake but I also enjoy the sake specialist's picks of newly arrived. Nice decor and friendly, helpful staff. Would love to come back soon.",5,HiroT,New York Area

"Been twice - food has been on point each time in every way, and the sommelier has simply knocked it out of the park with his wine pairings and explanations/conversations. We’ll go back as much as we can afford. :-)",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Truly amazing food.  Almost parallel in all of NYC,5,TheKitchenSpy,New York Area
Yellow fin tuna appetizer was a perfect opener. Half portion of lobster and short ribs was a creative update on surf and turf. Service was friendly and personable. A wonderful experience.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"We took my daughter and her boyfriend here for her 21st birthday dinner. We had the smaller of the tasting menus. All was lovely, food, service, ambiance, etc. All the courses were fine, and the wine list was also very nice (including numerous affordable French wines). While it was not cheap (our prix-fix was in the $80's) it was quite a nice value and compares very well to other top places. We had not been back since it reopened after the fire; it is back and running like its old self.",5,nathbeck,New York Area
One of the most lovely restaurants in Manhattan.  Terrific food in a gorgeous setting with professional and friendly waitstaff.  Wine list is creative as the restaurant tries very hard to offer interesting choices.  This should be on everyone's must try list!!,5,Nyer,New York Area
They are amazing and so friendly and accomadating! They treat vegans and vegetarians with the same respect as regular diners and it shows in the food!,5,OpenTable Diner,Washington DC
"Always  spectacular, you will dig deep, but worth it. Have been a couple times and will return again",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I have intended on eating at Mas for sometime because I knew it took pride in its use of farm fresh ingredients. Although I found the food good I think that there are so many better options available to the New York diner. The setting is rather unremarkable and the service is mediocre. The menu is diverse and certainly not extensive. This is not necessarily a criticism but in other restaurants I could make the same observation about, the selections I actually was excited about were few and far between. I can’t really say anything “bad” but I can’t honestly recommend Mas to a fellow diner. I feel the dollars spent here could be put to better use at so many other restaurants.",3,enjoygoodfood,Los Angeles
We had a family holiday dinner at Mas Farmhouse and it was superb from start to finish.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I love this restaurant - amazing food, great wine pairings, and spectacular service. Mas  farmhouse never disappoints. I highly recommend it for a special occasion.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I have always loved this restaurant and my most recent visit was no exception.  My date was a vegan and she loved the chefs creation as much as I did, and the wine pairing was excellent.",5,JKingH,New York Area
"Salty food, not really that good.  Did I say salty?",3,edwardp,New York Area

Really enjoyed . It was my birthday  Love the place,5,Anak,Miami
"Been here numerous times. Good food and attentive service are the reasons to go here. Well run front room. Wine list is expensive even by NY standards, but has a number of small lots from experienced producers. Other than a mix up on the starter cocktail, everything was excellently!",4,NowTOURISTS,New York Area
Food was luke warm and there were bones in the fish.,3,OpenTable Diner,New England
"We've been to Mas (farmhouse) several times, had lamented what had seemed like a permanent closing, and rejoiced when it re-opened. The food is spectacularly, but elegantly, wonderful, always a beautiful blend of flavors, colors and textures, served with impeccable timing. Wines are excellent, and wine pairings suggested by the sommelier always interesting. In addition, it's very reasonably priced, given the very high quality of the dining experience. My favorite restaurant in New York, one of my favorites of all time",5,Francesca,New York Area
"We found the whole experience intelligently and sensitively executed. I will come back at the next opportunity! The food is sophisticated and the service is the smartest in the city. Not overbearing, always anticipating what you might ask for, while remaining authentic/casual- the staff is not stiff and contrived but truly genuine. It made for a very relaxed atmosphere and through the whole night we felt we were being watched over , cared for. Highly recommend!",5,MWest,New York Area
"Absolutely perfect dining experience. The food is delicious without being overdone in terms of trying to find something too creative or too sophisticated. The food was incredibly flavorful and service was attentive. It's pricey, but worth it. The only part I would have skipped was the bottle of wine since they don't have many mid-tier options and the bottle was not exactly what I had wanted.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Amazing! The food was sensational (particularly the pork). Wonderful service,5,LEllen,New York Area

"Pricey but excellent food, ambience, and service. The desserts are extraordinary.",5,GabrielaN,New England
Sad to say the food was so salty! My partner sent his food back and I kept mine but both were overly salty.   Such a nice place it's a shame the food doesn't match the ambience. The yellow tail appetizer  however was insanely delicious   Was so looking forward to this neighborhood gem re- opening.  We live down the street and I wanted this to be more of a go to spot for us.  Second  time there and sadly won't go back .,3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Most elegant tasting menu in NYC. Incredible food and service.,5,CFS729,New York Area
Dinner was absolutely incredible.  Did 4 course tasting and every dish was a hit.  Tuna l’occidental is still my absolute favorite.  Kudos to chef Galen and the restaurant for an incredible experience.,5,JB16,New York Area
An otherwise nice meal was well spoiled by a VERY loud party which did not refrain from profanity.  When other guests complained they were called fascists and received no support from the restaurant staff.,2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Half empty on Sunday night. A party of 8 at the prominent family table.  Loud.  Really loud. As if they were in their own home.  No regard for the other two tables.  And not one word was said to them about ruining the meals of others.  So we had to confront them in a mild manner. Sure, 8 raucous people will bring in more money than 3 quiet people that night, but in the long run...",1,GourmetGigi,New York Area
"Tater totos, tacos, Montauk Mules, lobster rolls, lobster mac and cheese, are amazing!",5,MariaA,Washington DC
"Solid if not inspired food, but pleasant neighborhood casual place with decent prices and friendly staff. Sunday brunch was dead (which was welcome) but often it is quite vibrant at night. Good for souped up basics and bar food.",4,ecpnyc,New York Area
"Staying at a hotel down the street and was looking for a quick bite to eat without waiting in line.   Management accommodated us quickly and personally took care of our table ( They had a surprise wedding party show up that wasn't planned for ). Fire roasted oysters were excellent, I decided on the grilled chicken salad which was surprisingly wonderful with the lemon vinaigrette dressing. Side note:  I don't always eat this healthy, but was on vacation and haven't had a chance to exercise lately.  My wife splurged with the fish and chips and she said it was tasty.",5,OpenTable Diner,San Antonio
"The restaurant was empty at 12pm.  The service was very good.  The food was hit or miss.  The fried shrimp deviled eggs were very good as were the tater tots.  Everything went down hill from there.  The fish tacos although crunch were tasteless.  The nachos were very basic, and the pancakes were very small.",3,mryanhyde,New York Area
"It was good but didn't have either beers I wanted, one was a corona.. and he then brought he one similar and had to pay for the beer... decent service and decent food. Go ambiance and date place. My date and I agreed 3.6 out of 5",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"We went to a movie at the Film Forum a block away and came here for dinner.  Not sure at 8:00 pm we were prepared for as dark a bar as this is.  Lots of surfing movies and also sports.  Not fine dining.  The waitperson was nice and friendly and service was fine.  Hard to read the menu in the dark.  For two draft beers, a vietnamese wrap and two tacos with tax and tip $56.  Not expensive but not a cheap eat.  The tacos were great and the vietnamese wrap a bit on the tasteless side, but fresh.  It came with a good sized and tasty green salad.  I don't think we would go back, but the ambiance for the younger was good.",3,notoutallthetime,New York Area
"Disappponted. Everything was bland and under-seasoned. The service was not very enthusiastic and was unhelpful in ordering. The drinks were not impressive. I would not return, and judging from the restaurant being nearly empty at 8pm, I assume they struggle with repeat business.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Brunch on a Saturday was incredible!!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I was excited to visit a Marc Murphy restaurant and found this location convenient to our hotel. My husband and I both had fried fish preparations--he had the fish and chips meal and I ordered the fish tacos. We each found our dish to be excellent, in taste and portion size. We would definitely visit again and recommend to others.",4,PamelaW,Memphis
Food was uniformly good.  Service was very good. Place was empty and a bit pricey for what you get.,4,ahs87,New York Area
"Reliable place to go.  Good food, dinner, apps, good drinks.",4,Robert,New York Area
"Good small plates - deviled eggs with shrimp, and the jalapeño cheddar tater tots. The spam and fried oyster sandwich was just OK. Good cocktails- beer selection is OK",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
The lobster rolls are on my top 3 best places in NYC. The Montauk mules are delicious for summer!,5,MariaA,Washington DC
Great happy hour!!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
We want to move closer so we can come here all the time! Great ambiance and service. Went for the seafood but wound up having chicken burgers  and hot dogs with mac and cheese  (it was Memorial Day Weekend and as close as we were getting to a barbecue).   Only downside was the very small number of wines available by the glass.  Can't wait to go back,5,livinginnyc,New York Area
"The lobster rolls and Montaulk Mules are the perfect combo for a summer afternoon. The lobster mac and cheese is amazing as well. Rob is the best bartender there, always so nice!",5,MariaA,Washington DC
"One of my favorite neighborhood joints for creative cocktails and comfort food. Service can be a bit slow at times, but otherwise top notch. The lobster mac &amp; cheese is heaven in your mouth and there are so many great app options (bring a group to try them all).",4,CrunchyFries,New York Area
"Kind of disappointing, we felt the lobster roll was way over seasoned, all you tasted was tarragon and didn't taste the lobster.",3,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Good West Village lunch option, close to West 4th St subway too.  Kudos to the bartender for his excellent music playlist.",5,mhill157,New York Area
"Great food, prompt service. It was  a little loud but there was a large party going on the night we were there. The dining areas are surrounding the bar so the entire place is a little on the loud side. Overall very good!",4,hvillediner,Birmingham
"I loved the food at this restaurant and it came highly recommended by friends. The one issue during my visit was, one person in our party had a shellfish allergy and we found out that all the food is fryed in the same fryolater oil as shrimp,  so he could not really eat anything on the menu that was fried which was disappointing.  We were planning to order the calamari or guacamole and chips and he normally would eat those no problem,  but he could not touch them.  He would have liked french fries but did not get those either. I would have assumed since a shellfish allergy is not an uncommon one, and they have so many friend items on the menu that they may separate the oils.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Food was excellent. Deviled eggs were delicious. Totally would come back again,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
We loved this neighborhood spot. My hungry 15 year old son appreciated that the starters were large. Delicious!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
They were super accommodating to get us a larger table when we needed it! Food is super comforting - fries nice and hot!,4,opentablereviewsmb,Washington DC
There was a dog sitting on a woman's lap at the next table ! At one point I saw that the dog had his paws on the table and was licking the table ! Not a place I would ever go back to.,3,Ronalorena,New York Area
We had a great evening with lovely fingerfood. Great atmosphere and very relaxed.,4,OpenTable Diner,London
Great food - sweet waitress but a bit forgetful (we never got our sides).,3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Average food for high price. And I'm a West village native of 11 years.  Average service, had to ask for everything.  TV sports bar vibe in what should be a nicer environment to reflect the feeling of Montauk, a place I visit frequently.  Do not recommend compared to all the other choices in the neighborhood",1,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The food was good, however I would come back for appetizers and drinks only",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Thought this would be more of a restaurant, but it was a bar setting.",3,GabV,New York Area
"This place used to be great. They have become more of a hot dog joint while raising their prices significantly. When I almost fell out of my chair at being charged SIX DOLLARS for an ICED TEA, I thought it was in error. ""That's the West Village,"" responds the server. No, dude: it's how little you think of your customers. Been going here for 10+ years. No mas.",1,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Great food and value for the $, in a cool little corner of the West Village. It is so dark however, that you cannot read the menu without using the flashlight app on your phone, which the server recommended.",4,ecpnyc,New York Area
"We went back to Ditch Plains after many years -- we missed the lobster roll and pear martini (no longer on the menu, alas!). The lobster roll was as we remembered it (except that it was served with French fries rather than sweet potato fries, in my view an improvement). The menu has changed, bu the quality remains.",4,NJvisitor,New York Area
Prices seems to go up and food was not very tasty as it has been in the past. Just because its summer and the restaurant is not crowded doesn't mean a drop in the quality of the food and a raise in price. Many brunch places make a bloody Mary or Mimosa from scratch and do not charge the same price as Ditch,2,DavidA,Los Angeles
Very good food but a little too noisy too early in the night Would gladly go back,5,OpenTable Diner,New England
"Ok finger, bar food. Not much on the ambiance.",3,Skip,New York Area
"Met here with cousins on a Thursday night. Practically empty which should have been a sign. Not terrible, but the seafood didn't taste fresh. Tuna burger was especially fishy. Decent vibe and good drinks but wouldn't recommend for a meal.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Went for brunch with friends. The Eggs Benedict with crabmeat was terrific. The yogurt pancakes not so much. Leaden belly bombs with little flavor.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

"Could be the loudest restaurant we've ever been to -- couldn't hear each other or our waiter.  We were seated right next to the restroom (a one person one at that) so constant stream of people in and out around us.  Food was ok, not great.  We probably wouldn't go back.",2,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
"Great place to eat...fun atmosphere. The fired chicken was amazing, and great to share as an appetizer. You certainly walk away feeling full and satisfied, and not too overly expensive.  Would definitely recommend to a friend.",4,OpenTable Diner,Las Vegas

Great food and service!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Always an amazing meal. We had out of town guests in, with their child, and The Smith WOW'd everyone. Chicken Parm was great and not super heavy.  Pork Schnitzel was so good (who knew?)!  Pepper burger was awesome, jalapeño cheese grits out of this world.  We love coming to the Smith.",5,DLVATL,New York Area
Our server Emily rocked our socks off.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I had quite a large group of people in my party, and The Smith was extremely accommodating, quick service, and delicious food. This is one of the smaller locations, so expect to wait on a busy weekend night. Love the blue cheese fondue, mac and cheese, gnocchi, and prosecco. It's one of the best meals I've had in the city.",5,Cassie,New York Area
We've been to the East Village location many times and never disappoints.  A little pricey but the food is tremendous and the portions are generous.   The  service is always prompt without being intrusive.  A good time and we will definitely be back.,4,JonathanB,New York Area

Great food and time!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"A great spot for a group of friends or a family gathering. Lots on the menu for sharing, which is what we chose to do. A few apps, a few mains, and some desserts, and we were filled to the brim. The wine seems expensive for what it is and everything is a bit overpriced, but overall we enjoyed ourselves. This is a reliable spot that I suggest for groups and I'm rarely disappointed. We ordered the calamari, the tartare, a dozen oysters, duck wings, a kale salad, and cocktails to start. Then we had the NY strip, brick chicken, chicken meatballs and spaghetti, ragu pasta, another salad, and everything was great. We let them know we were sharing and asked them to cut up the chicken and steak into strips for us, which they obliged and it was exceedingly helpful. For dessert, we ordered the bread pudding and some chocolate dessert, I can't recall the name. We were completely satisfied and would definitely return.",4,deekay,New York Area

Very good service and food. I have been there several times and the wait staff always friendly and attentive.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

A few girlfriends and I dined here on Saturday night. We are all vegetarian and we were all blown away by the flavor of every dish we tried. Don't be afraid to bring your meat eater friends here because they won't miss it.   The fried potato bread is as crazy as they say it is. I can't wait to return.,5,grozzing,New York Area
"My girlfriends and I typically have a hard time finding a place for dinner because one of our friends is vegan and doesn't want to be relegated to eating side dishes for dinner. Nix's vegetarian vegetable centered menu, and separate vegan menu, was the perfect solution.    The portions are on the small side so I'm glad we decided to split a bunch of dishes.  For four of us, we had: Crudite and avocado mint curry dip (starter), cauliflower tempura with steamed buns and pickled veg, yukon potato frybread, veganized farro dish, eggplant and broccoli rabe and one dessert per person.    The table favorite was the cauliflower with the eggplant as a close second.  Each dish had it's own distinct and delicious flavor, no one had a single complaint.  The server was attentive and answered all of our questions about the menu.  When our pregnant friend inquired about the non-alcoholic homemade sodas, we were excited to hear that the server had made them herself.    Believe all the hype you're hearing about this place, it's that good!",5,Bspoke5,New York Area
Service has some kinks to work through but that's natural for a brand new restaurant under such high demand.  Food is fantastic.  The wine list has plenty of exciting options. The bar has some work to do.  Despite jiggers set up on the bar I didn't see anyone using them.  That's unacceptable at the level that they are trying to play.  What's the point of putting together an ambitious cocktail list if no one is executing it properly?,4,doctorFUNK,New York Area
I can't wait to go back. The service was excellent. Friendly and Informative. Every dish and every drink was perfect.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

Went to Bacaro on a date the other night. I thought that the ambience (especially downstairs) and the food were excellent. Great place for either a date or a group.,4,sanj,New York Area
"This place turns out Venetian classics in a very cool space. The restaurant is in a former cellar. I had the spaghetti nero and the Insalata di Granchio (Crab Salad over Polenta), both were great.... The Spaghetti Nero is an explosion of flavor. If you are a polenta lover, this is your place.",4,Carlo,New York Area
"Found this place through Open Table. Wasn't disappointed. Located South of Canal, bar is street level, dining in cellar. Wonderful atmosphere. Friendly hostess &amp; waiter. Some interesting food choices (frogs legs for appetizers were delicious). Wine list as well as cocktails were good. All our main dishes were on point. I had the Stinco Di Maiale (braised pork shank with polenta) which was delish! Gelato &amp; Tera Mi Su shared at our table of 5 was perfect. They even added a birthday candle for my son &amp; me to blow out together.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Went back after 5 years and was not disappointed! The food is delicious, highly recommend the cod, the polenta was delicious and the flourless cake was divine! Service was very good, they have a nice wine selection and offer quartinos which i love! Love the decor, the downstairs is very romantic but also great for groups. Highly recommend!",5,Topo,New York Area

"The atmosphere inside is amazing - gorgeous and cozy and cave-like chic - and you're in CHINATOWN. Really cool and romantic. The food is great. Maybe not for very serious foodies, but it was delicious. Not light fare. Think exposed brick cellar and candle lit.",5,Samantha,New York Area
"I recall this place being fantastic few years ago! (Back when they didn't have a hostess at the entrance.) Great food, amazingly friendly service, relaxed atmosphere... But this time around, it was just ""eh..."" and was even a bit disappointed. We ordered sparkling, white and then red wine...and our waiter tried to pour all three wines using the same glass that we started with! (We let him go using the sparkling glass for the white that we ordered, but attempting to use the same glass for all 3 wines ordered?? we couldn't let it go this time...) Maybe it was a busy night, but not acceptable in a restaurant. I'm hoping that we just had an off night - I would try again in maybe a few months.",3,KeyLime,New York Area
"I took my boyfriend here for his 32nd birthday. This place was excellent from the food, service,ambience etc was excellent!! My boyfriend was so pleased and so was I.",5,Debbie,New York Area
"I picked Bacaro as it was an OpenTable diners choice. The location is definitely random but when you descend into the cellar you forget that you are in the middle of nowhere. Beautiful room. Horrible benches and chairs. We really liked the waiter and he made great food and wine recommendations, however the food came out way too fast! The spicy meatballs were dry and we were unimpressed with the braised pork. Really liked the zucchini flowers, the asparagus and egg, and the pasta with duck ragu. Dessert menu was pretty sparse as well. In all, we enjoyed ourselves but wouldn't rave about this place.",3,Jar1229,New York Area
"Love this place. Food, ambience, staff -- everything osnperfect",5,Sebb,New York Area
This is in our nabe and we occasionally go but haven't been in quite a bit. Chose it because one of our friends is a vegetarian and this place is a good choice if you're facing that. Menu is bigger than I remembered and it's not all small plates for sharing like it used to be although you can still order bunches of appetizers for that. Wonderful place.,5,Lizzie,New York Area
"It's all about the braised pork shank! Amazing dish. Meat falling off the bone, on super tasty polenta. Big enough to share.",5,Rasturo,Washington DC
"Bacaro is in an interesting part of the city and the restaurant picks up on this eclectic vibe in both ambiance and fare. We made a reservation but still had to wait about 20mins to sit down, slightly annoying but not a deal breaker. There are two bars - up and downstairs. Standing upstairs is not an option. Downstairs is cavernous and moody in lighting, great for a date night. Lots of great small plates to choose from with interesting specials like razor clams and frog legs. Entrees are consistent and filling. Wine list was also very good and well priced. Our server was very good; both pleasant and efficient. We were a group of five and could have comfortably been more so great spot for groups which is difficult at best in New York.",4,Ktown,New England
"Bacaro is consistently one of my favorite spots in NYC, for its quality Venetian food, reasonable prices, wonderful ambience and lovely service. It feels like a hidden gem since it's on an out-of-the-way street and at street level, you can't tell that the real restaurant lies below in the basement level which feels like a cozy, romantic wine cellar with nooks and crannies. Great for a date, a family meal, or a large birthday or special occasion (there are multiple tables that fit 8-10 people. And the food, focused on seafood and meats, is absolutely outstanding.",5,Siena,New York Area
"Benchseating was not comfortable, everything else was great.",4,Jaegbomb,Minneapolis

"We went here to celebrate a special occasion. The atmosphere was great, a unique dining space. The food was fantastic the portions were what as Americans we would consider small but actually they are the size that people should be eating. I had the whole wheat pasta with duck ragu, FANTASTIC. The tiramisu for dessert was the real deal and delicious. I highly recommend dining here.",4,weezy113,New York Area
Service and ambiance were very good. Food ranged from ordinary to below average. No need for a return visit.,3,tavolaseeker,New York Area
"We came in from Toronto and were worried about finding an interesting spot for dinner, as most suggest the same old well known spots. Luckily we knew someone from the lower east side that found this little cavernous gem. I would definitely recommend trying this restaurant. You will not be dissapointed if you are looking for something different with great food. I had the razor clams as an app and moved on to the stripped ribeye and salad.",5,dRock4,Toronto
We were having a girls night. We had a great time! Staff was very attentive and waitress was very accamodating.,4,Aparna,New York Area
"The only bad thing about Bacaro is the location. Billed as LES, its actually in Chinatown. Pulling up, it looks like a bar in a bad neighborhood. The dining room is downstairs and looks like an old wine cellar or the catacombs. Dimly lit. For a couples date, its great. The food was unreal. Razor clams; whole wheat pasta with duck ragu; gnocchi with mushrooms,etc. The wine list is okay and reasonably priced. The staff is friendly, attentive and knowledgeable. Had an anniversary dinner here. Would have liked a more secluded table, but otherwise fantastic. Walking distance to Little Italy.",5,OpenTable Diner,Poconos
"Spaghetti Nero, Pasta with cuttlefish ink, was great, but the portion might be on the lighter side.  Stinco Di Maiale, Braised pork shank with polenta, on the other hand can feed a family of 4.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
The best place to go when your downtown on the East side!,4,Cgold212,New York Area
The lighting downstairs is spot on. Please don't ever change it. It's what lure's people in and what keeps them coming back! Along w the amazing food and friendly staff :) -Jax,5,JACKY,New York Area
"I came here a couple of times already and I always loved the food! I came here this time for a birthday celebration, and it was perfect. We kind of had our own dining room in the back, and the ambiance was rustic and romantic. I had the pork this time and it was so yummy. It was so juicy and big! Everything went very well, except towards the end. We brought our own birthday cake, and they charged $3 per plate to serve it. It would've costed more than the cake itself. So we left after the entree and had the cake somewhere else.",4,Celebrate83,New York Area
The Bacaro we dined at was nothing like the descriptions I read. It was if all the adults took the night off and left the less experienced and less professional kids in charge. Our waiter had little knowledge of the food and when asked he described everything as his favorite. The music was loud and destroyed the ambience of what could be a lovely restaurant if the people running the show were professionals with an investment in their reputation for great food and service in a unique setting.,2,Particular,New York Area
"Bacaro is one of my favorite restaurants - the food is sublime and the venue is cozy and beautiful. The staff is friendly, accommodating and nice. Love it!",5,Kp22,New York Area
"...receptionist should be fired! Called for directions and was basically told to use my smartphone to find my way. Explained that I can't see the text on mobile becuase I didn't have my reading glasses on me. Responded that she is not from town and can't give me directions! What? Excuse me? Anyway..whatever. Food is ok, ambiance is ok, music horrid and asked for it to be turned down which they did (thank you very much), server ok, bus boy - super! Our bus boy acted more of how our waitress should (she was not bad but could be little more attentive). Kudos to my bus boy.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

"And we almost didn't find it!! Just a B on the door and a paper menu in the window in the middle of Chinatown so be aware!! But, the food was delicious, and we had a great night with our first time NY visitors. Loved the artichoke appy and the creamy polenta. Our Kansas friend devoured the pork shank and the gnocchi were light and tasty. The polpetti needs some beefing up...tiny things and a little dry. Loved all the desserts except the rice pudding. We will definitely come back.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"We invited another couple to Bacaro based on our past very positive experiences there. Unfortunately, the night we went the service was terrible. Firstly, we were seated downstairs in an alcove without any cool air on an extremely hot noght. we have eaten here several times amd the seating downstairs in the main area is very comfortable. Seomdly, we weren't even finished with our appetizers , when they arrived minutes later with our entrees. None of the appetizer plates had been removed and there was no where to set the entrees down. I was still eating my appetizer when it was taken away. The waitress was no where to be found and it was chaotic . When she I'd finally check on our table we were done eating.",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
I had a late night reservation at Bacaro and was pleasantly surprised. The basement has a great cool intimate feel. I ordered the squid ink penne and it was killer.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"What a surprise to find this place (thanks, Open Table!) in the middle of a rather seedy, Chinatown block. We walked past it several times before realizing we had found it. Walk down the stairs and you are in another world; dimly lit, cool, old brick walls, several small eating areas. The food was wonderful and different, not your usual Italian fare. The polenta, which was smooth and creamy, actually tasted like corn and was the best I've ever had. Every dish coming out looked terrific. Also notable were the mini spicy meatball appetizer. Very affordable, including the wine list. We will return.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

Food was excellent service average despite the large # of people in the restaurant. The place was cold not sure if they had a heating issue,3,Tonye,Austin
"The service here is second to none.  Patrons are actually cared for by a team.  Kudos! The food is excellent.  Soup, salad, main dishes and desserts were all superb. What I did not like and would stop me from returning is the noise.  One cannot engage in conversation.  Some acoustic panels set into the ceiling squares, a carpet and some cushioned walls would reduce the volume.  And please get rid of the cheap flower arrangements.  They look funereal.  Better to do none than cheap mums and carnations.",4,Maddie,Philadelphia
"delicious food, good wine selection, good vibe. definitely will return",5,OpenTable Diner,London
"My fourth visit to this establishment , as the previous three had been excellent. Dined with friends and family. We were subjected to a ""Meal Auction"" of who is having this and did you order this , for Appetizers and Entree's. Clearly the runners had not been provided with a table plan by the Server. Restaurant Service 101.... Wine suggested by the Sommelier was not available, as the one bottle they had in inventory the previous day had been Sold. Four of my party ordered Oysters and Shrimp Cocktails (2 of each) and for some bizarre reason, these were served together and not on individual plates. *Not every Guest likes to share plates. Steak entree was under seasoned and tough. Check back was relatively insincere and my hardly touched Ceasar Salad went un-noticed. There would have to be a compelling reason for me to return or recommend.",2,OpenTable Diner,Los Angeles
"The lunch menu prices are the reason this place is so empty $24 for a pasta? That's dinner for sure, and with so many other options in Soho, this is worth skipping",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

"Waiter didn't come around to take orders for more than 20 minutes and not a single staff member was to be found when looking for one.  Food was middle of the road and overpriced.  Also, the lunch menu was very sparse.  I get it--you may not want to have too many items on a menu but they needed a few more options.  Would it kill them to offer the chance to add chicken or shrimp to a garden salad?  I should think not (and if it was offered, it wasn't apparent on the menu, nor did the server make reference to it being an option).",2,Anonymous,New York Area
We loved Sessanta. Great food and service - definitely check it out.,4,Michael,New York Area
Service was t great but the actual food was very good!,2,Karina,Atlantic City
"They had a Sicilian inspired menu with authentic Italian dishes and reasonable prices. Some of the best bottarga pasta and cannolis in town. Now they've changed chef and veered into pseudo Italian (new Italian-American?), with poor taste founded in no tradition (red peppers with pasta and squid...). Closer to LI than to Cefalu'. What a shame. Go for a drink, or sit in the front-door patio, but avoid the full meal!",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Overall great food and ambiance! The pistachio tortellone and the Orata were our favorites.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
We really enjoyed our time at Sessanta. Friendly and extremely attentive service. Thoughtful cocktails. Delicious pasta.,5,AMjp,New York Area
Service was good and manager was apologetic for the horrible food preparation.  the appetizer was way too salty.  The manager agreed and delivered a new order that was adequate.  The main courses were both disgusting.  The fish was stuffed with some kind of pureed vegetables.  This was not part of the description on the menu and was an unwelcome surprise.  The meat was swimming in butter.   They have recently introduced the menu and new chef.  We ended up without a meal or a bill....,1,mara,New York Area

"Chef Adam prepared a truly amazing meal for our birthday celebration. Each first course was better than the next, beautifully presented and utterly delicious. The pastas were amazing! Fresh, perfect amount of sauce, cooked to perfection. I particularly liked the lemon pasta. The entrees were great (although I stopped at pasta, I tasted a few). The steak was melt in your mouth flavorful, so too was the hanger steak. Hurry quick to the restaurant Chef Adam has just begun and word will be out soon about the wonderful food.",5,OpenTable Diner,Philadelphia

We went this place during testaurant week. There wasn't much option to select from the restaurant week dinner. There was no option for vegeterian choice and simple pasta was under cooked. My wife only eat veg and chicken but no item in menu was chicken dish. Service and ambience was good but food was not something my wife and I liked.,2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Came for brunch around 3:00 on weekend.  Place was largely empty and we were seated right away.  Ordered and food never came.  Waiters kept walking by avoiding eye contact.  After 30 minutes I made a scene, manager investigated, something had gone wrong (probably the order wasn't entered).  I wanted to leave, he asked us to stay and comped us the entire meal.  The food (when it came) was all very good.  The manager did the right thing, which was appreciated.  If this was a once-in-a-great-while screw up, which happens to every restaurant, I would recommend.  But since I have no way of knowing if this was symptomatic of common problems or a stuff happens, I can't recommend.",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

Another stunner of a meal. 3rd time dining and I'm blown away each time. The pike quenelle is so light and flavorful. The pheasant with the basmati rice may replace the lobster and squab as my favorite dish.  Every sauce is absolutely delicious. Thank you all!,5,FOHgirl519,New York Area

"From the moment we made reservations to the last bite of our desserts, Fantastique! Upon arrival, Troy made us feel welcomed and excited to begin our dining experience. Our Sommelier, Dominique, was knowledgeable and delightful. The stars of the evening were the morsels of delicious courses we enjoyed, the oysters, the lobster, the halibut,  sweetbreads, filet, duck - desserts-outstanding!  The ambiance was perfect - I particularly enjoyed the listening the hum or ""music"" of the open kitchen- tranquil - similar to the feeling of walking in the Jardins des Tuilerie.... peaceful, happy-tranquil.  Thank you so very much for making our first Le Cou Cou experience - beautiful! We look forward to our next dining experience at Le Cou Cou.",5,Foodelicious,New York Area

Service is attentive but no one hovers, the sommelier is incredibly helpful, the place is gorgeous, the lighting, even at lunch, makes everyone look fabulous and the food is amazing. I’ve eaten at Le Coucou several times and it’s always wonderful. Yes, it’s expensive but you get what you pay for.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

Le Coucou is a new favorite!  The space is beautiful and romantic.  Tables are nicely spaced. Service was very professional - well informed and not intrusive.  Most of all... the food was delicious.

Excellent food and atmosphere. Staff is always very attentive. Wonderful as always!!,5,KathleenL,New York Area
"Lovely restaurant with some really superb food. The service was friendly and efficient.  My one caveat was that while individually each element on the plate was extraordinary, the combinations did not always work.  For example, the quenelle (which were so light and delicate in flavor) was paired with a glorious lobster sauce rich and heavy with taste that was good enough to spoon on its own.  Unfortunately, the quenelle was completely overpowered.  The appetizer of  green beans and foie gras confit had the beans beautifully cooked and sweet and best foie gras confit I've ever had.  It did not need the addition of a small dice of mixed dried fruit which added nothing to the confit and by comparison robbed the beans of their fresh sweetness.  Luckily, the solution for my meal was easy, I simply left the dried fruit on the plate and ate the soufflé- like quenelles on their own and enjoyed the lobster sauce as a rich soup.  This way I enjoyed  brilliant  food in a lovely atmosphere.  I would recommend the restaurant with pleasure.",4,LESLIE13,New York Area

"Perfectly executed French classics: flavorful, rich, and memorable.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

"Le Cou Cou is a beautiful restaurant with wonderful food -- creatively prepared and delicious.  I love its casual formality, soft lighting at night, yet the liveliness of having a kitchen that is open to the dining room.  The service is excellent.  The problem with the restaurant is obtaining  a reservation and the attitude of the reservationist.  After all, restauranteurs are in a service industry and treating a potential customer like a second-class citizen is just not good business.  We had such a hard time and we called 28 days in advance that I almost dread calling the next time.",5,Louey,Washington DC
"Wonderful imaginary trip to Provence in SOHO, elegant setting, attentive knowledgeable service, pedestrian skate wing transformed into culinary and artistic delight thanks to pool of red.orange red pepper coulis; sarrasin crepe great base for perfectly poached lobster/egg and sauce(more needed!), chocolate tart  was nice but generic at any high end restaurant.

I had the Tete de Veau - tasty, rich....delicious with chopped egg and an anchovy fillet.  The fried ""cake"" of veal couldn't be more flavorful.  Also had the steak tartare...I love that they give you all the mixings on the side so you can add what you wish of all the flavorings  to your taste....perfection....good wine...good company....thoughtful service.

Unfortunately, the staff was snooty, ignorant of the beer menu, would not let us split the $115 chefs menu, then proceeded to tell us the selection of this menu was a ""surprise"". We left after our drinks and a salad. I would not recommend this at all. They were not friendly or accomodating.",1,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
It was fabulous. We went for a business dinner with people from our subsidiary. They enjoyed dinner very much. We allowed the chef to choose a six course tasting menu. They simply asked about our likes and dislikes and any allergies we might have and determined our meal from there. The food was wonderful and the staff were helpful and very friendly. We would definitely go back for work and I have told friends that they would enjoy dinner there as well. I am looking forward to my next meal at Mas.,5,DKO13,New York Area
"This was our fourth visit to Mas and we were looking forward to it, as our previous vists had all been wonderful. Although the food was great as before, the service let us down a bit this time, in particular the detached and unfriendly demeanour of the bar man. This came through in particular at the end of the meal, when we wanted to have a final drink at the bar before going home and were told in a rude and ""I couldn't care less"" manner that everything had already been closed off. Obviously, the bar man and his colleagues wanted to go home after a long evening (although it wasn't that late) but as a minimum they could have remained friendly and perhaps recommended somewhere else to go. It may be some time before we come back.",3,Joachim,"Dined on May 6, 2012"

"Quite simply, the high aspirations and correspondingly high achievement of this totally enchanting restaurant has made it my NYC favorite -- even after my very first experience. What most impressed me -- even thrilled me -- is the clearly deep dedication to making guests feel good. So it's a series of superb experiences: a charming and solicitous greeting, comfortable and quietly voluptuous decor, delightful table settings, well informed and gracious servers, and well paced service, climaxed by a appealingly innovative menu emphasizing fresh, ultra high quality local ingredients and sophisticated yet simple preparations.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Our party of five seated promptly. Space in back room more traditional and less communal than front. Starters included mushroom soup, lobster, tuna tarte. All delicious. Maz seems to focus on seasonal fish dishes (which 3 ordered). Gnocci one entre very good. Presentation always creative. Scallop entre and halibut entre fresh and flavorful. David, our server, was efficient and knowledgable. Wine list extensive but he helped select a nice French Chablis. Moussse desert very nice.

"Food was good, nothing amazing but everything was really good. Overall it was a poor experience due to service. It was atrocious. We had a reservation, after walking and waiting for nearly ten minutes we had to approach someone in the kitchen to get seated. Once seated we received very little attention, was never offered to hear specials and overall the feeling was we were a burden to the waiter.  Also, we went specifically for the fried chicken Wednesday, as mentioned on the their website menu. They said that location didn't do it, though that location said they did over the phone earlier in the day.",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"As a fan of Marc Murphy's Landmarc, I had great expectations, but Ditch Plains is to be avoided, at least for lunch. We were there when the restaurant opened and were the only ones there for a very long time, still the service was non-existent and we waited 40 minutes for 2 egg sandwiches which when they arrived were hard and cold. We feared the bacon would break our teeth and the potatoes too were cold and in addition tasteless. There is nothing to recommend Ditch Plains.",2,Bonnie,New York Area

i love this restaurant and got lots. Lots of vegetarian options and delicious comfort food. I was very sad that they ran out of my favorite Mac and Cheese on NYE - I was looking so forward to it. Happy hour is also fun here too.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"great food. the worst service i've had at a restaurant in a long time. Did not come over once to see how everything was, took way too long to put in a drink order, let alone get the drinks! Little knowledge of the menu. Food was really good, but I dont think i would ever go back.",3,hungry,New York Area
The homemade s'mores were a huge hit with the 9 kids we brought along to the party of 14 total. They handled our big group seamlessly.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I decided to make a brunch reservation here for family visiting me in NYC. It was a gamble to book at a restaurant I'd never been to, but with a critics pick on nymag and the celebrity chef Marc Murphy on board I thought it was a safe bet. Ditch Plains might have been great in 2006, but in Nov 2012 it certainly was not. We arrived at 11:30 for brunch and were the only people in the restaurant. The server didn't know the specials of the day. The eggs Benedict looked sad, not vibrant or luscious. My lobster roll was overpriced and had some shell in it. It was served over a batch of unsalted, over-fried sweet potato chips. The cobb salad looked redeeming and the atmosphere was nice. But if I were you, I'd suggest walking to MarketTable instead",1,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I imagine this is a decent go-to restaurant if you live in the area, but not the place to go if you're looking for really delicious, inventive food. The spicy salad was far better than the fish tacos - and the deviled eggs were basic, but tasty. Not someplace for a special occasion, but it's a good, moderately priced neighborhood restaurant.",2,TLWBC,New York Area
"Great Southern style cuisine. The appetizers were the best things we had, in particular the fried pickles and jalapeno cheddar tatter tots. The fish tacos were pretty good, and the hot dogs looked fantastic (unfortunately didn't get to try).",4,aj454,New York Area
"Went with a big group. It was very tight. I would not suggest going with a larger group than 4. However, the food was excellent! The waiter was awesome (considering there were 10 of us in a cramped spot). I will definitely go back, but with less people.",4,Foodie303,New York Area
"We took my girlfriend's family to Ditch Plains, all of them came from out of town. We needed a place that had different types of food choices and also had a nice environment and location. They loved the atmosphere, food options and their overall experience. This is a great place to eat and I will gladly eat there again, I have yet to have a bad meal at Ditch Plains.",5,aw168303,New York Area
This is a great place to gather with friends. There is a relaxed vibe and isn't too noisy so you can catch up with friends. They have large booths that comfortably fit 6 but I probably wouldn't come here if it were a larger group because you might get seated separately. The smoked mozzarella appetizer is out of this world. I also indulged in the Ditch Dog which was a surprisingly large portion. They serve 2 dogs covered in mac &amp; cheese plus fries. The smores are a must have sinful treat! They do have healthy options on the menu but I suggest you skip the diet when you go to Ditch Plains!,4,zaibot,New York Area
Loved that there was a wide selection to choose from for lunch.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"deep fried candy bars and ditch dogs are amazing. good for a casual first date. overall fun time, energetic, not too quiet",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"We went for a birthday celebration, shared apps and each had our own entree. The service and the food was great. I brought a cake and they waved the plating fee as well which was very nice. Overall a great experience.",4,KimC,New York Area
"I came here with 5 other friends and we all had a great time. Overall, Ditch has tasty food and it was an easy-going, pleasant experience. I will be back and will keep this in mind when visitors are in town and we have a big group.",3,Foodiesvs,New York Area
Food was very good. Waitor was a terrible. I mentioned it to Mgr as I left and they were grateful for direct feedback and ask us to give them another shot ... Which we will based upon the food and their response.,3,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Most delicious and most expensive lobster rolls I've ever had. Music was too loud, and we sat by the door, so very frenetic.",3,OpenTable Diner,London
Great for kids and families. Nice upscale comfort food.,3,bakedbeans212,New York Area
Our party kept growing and growing over the evening they were very accomodating. Good times for all!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"We usually go here for work lunches. Small place but good eats and reasonable prices. The few times I have been here, the service has lacked, but all in all, it's a solid find in the West Village.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Pretty good comfort food and great seating for groups.,3,Rye20Foodie,New York Area
Great atmosphere and the service was superb. very friendly and attentive wait staff. The food was quite good and we loved the unusual twist to some great comfort foods. I was surprised that to liquors I asked for were not available--and not unusual liquors. The waitress and bar tender made alternate suggestions and worked hard to accommodate our drink preferences. I will definitely go back.,4,DanM,New York Area
"Ditch Plains has the best mac &amp; cheese around! It's something you just HAVE to get when you go....definitely should not be missed. Everything else has always been really good too, and the service is always great. Not a ton of seating, but I've never had any issues during brunch time. Will be back!",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Ditch Plains is a great casual place with a large menu for even the pickiest and vegetarian eater! We went for brunch in a group of 10, which included 3 kids, and they had so many options for us and a special kids menu for the kids. The french toast was Enormous!! and delicious! The lobster roll was good but not as good as Luke's, but the sweet potato chips it comes with was a great touch! The restaurant was very accommodating to our large group and we enjoyed ourselves! A good affordable find in the west village",3,sambam,New York Area
"No Maker's Mark, Jameson or cappuccino. WTF.",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I made a reservation on Open Table last Friday at Ditch Plains for the same night for 9 people at prime dinner time. When we arrived, we were welcomed warmly by Michelle and our table was ready for us. They let us sit down and get comfortable even though not everyone in our party had arrived yet. Our party took up quite a bit of room as most of the tables are 6-person booths, but our waitress was so nice and really took care of us. The watermelon martinis, salmon tartare and skirt steak were delicious (would've loved more chimichurri though!) The ONLY complaint I have is that bc it was the hottest day of the year, it was extremely hot. But not much could've helped that. Otherwise, a really fun night! I would definitely go back!",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"large booths and few 2 tops makes it a bit awkward for seating at times, but the staff and food make up for any waiting or crowding. the basic menu items are all tasty and right on the money for just slightly upscale comfort food. nothing exotic or fancy - just YUMMY.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Ditch Plains is rapidly becoming a favorite neighborhood gem. The food is unexpectedly better than you imagine and that is great.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Food is amazing. Portions are a bit small even in the heartier portion of the menu,4,Nic14,New York Area
"My experience at Nix can be described as the best meal I've experience in 2016. Not only is the ambiance of Nix perfected, but the fantastic vegetarian food paired with the friendly waitresses and waiters... Makes for an ideal dining experience. I can't wait to return and bring with me friends and family, vegetarian and non- vegetarians. Thank you for creating a place like Nix!",5,HalleS,New York Area
"Food tastes good but is heavy. Server recommended we get one more entree, which we did and regretted once we finished the delicious apps (Nan, yogurt dip, Egg Salad). We skipped dessert. I wan't impressed with the main dishes. Great ambiance if you get the booth for two by the bar. Loved cocktails and apps. We may just sit at the bar next time and nibble on small plates.",3,KaoriS,New York Area
Everything overall was superb w/the exception of humorless waitress. The experience would have been near perfection if only our waitress cracked a smile every so often. Her recommendations were spot on as far as food &amp; drinks go.,4,Elegant61,New York Area
"Absolutely perfect once again. This was our forth time at Nix, and we will keep coming back. Really enhoyed a couple of great new additions to the menu, so we can continue to try something new, while some the great ""classics"" are still available. Our server Vanessa was simply amazing!",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The snobbiness of the waitstaff was not in keeping with the food and the vibe. I had to fight to put in the order I wanted my food to arrive, as she told me that it ""went backwards against flavor."" Really?",3,lizmargolies,New York Area
"When we found out we would be heading to NYC, NIX was at the top of our must-eat list.  We arrived in Greenwich a bit early so we walked down the block - this is important - DO THIS.  Go early and pregame at the Knickerbocker down the street - sit at the bar.  Old, established neighborhood gem.  Plus, based on reviews, we knew drinks while good, would be small and $$ at NIX.  We walked down to NIX at our res time and were seated immediately.  Our waitress was lovely, we were in a great mood, so meh - we ordered cocktails anyway.  :)  Some watermelon, alcohol, champagne concoction that was light, beautiful, and so delicious, one turned to two.  We started the meal with appetizers - get the green pea hummus - I usually deplore peas, but it was to die for.  We had the sweet buns, and of course the cauliflower.  Every dish was tapas sized and sharing made it possible to order many dishes.  While vegetarian (with vegan options), please know that this is not health food.  It is indulgent, but these vegetables died happy - trust me.",4,Lsharp,Austin
Sharp service and excellent vegetarian food with some Med options that isn't predictable. Highly recommend for a more elevated vegetarian meal.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Nix is excellent and great for all occasions. Everything I tried was superb but what stood out was the cauliflower tempura, gnocchi, and the spiced eggplant and pin nut dip. Will definitely go to Nix any chance I get.",5,AlidaK,New York Area
"Nice place. High end no meat venue with some interesting dishes but no wow factor. Amazing dips to start with great tandoori bread. Other dishes don't fare as well. Still not sure about the cacio e pepe and the shaved fennel was  just ok. Compared to Crossroads in LA, it's not in the same league but still pretty good. M",3,Mikeyu,Los Angeles
"Food was just ok.  We ordered everything that's recommended on yelp and by the waiter.  Food just turned out to be ok.  I love checking out new restaurants on NYMag's power rankings.  The overall experience was great (service, ambiance, location, food, etc.).  I mean the place was buzzing like crazy, the staff was perfectly attentive, the space was super dope....... but the food was just ok.",4,SortOfAFoodie,New York Area
A fabulously inventive vegetarian menu. Very well informed and courteous Wait staff. Nice GV ambiance. What more could anyone want?,5,JudithC,New York Area

AMAZING. OVER THE TOP. INCREDIBLE.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Everything was amazing.  It really is a top vegetarian option.  I loved it!,5,Mimi,New York Area
The food at Nix was great and our server was fantastic. It was hard to get the attention of the hostess and there was not a lot of room to wait for her. Atmosphere was very trendy - not as friendly as we would have hoped for.,4,CurlyGirl,New England
We were running late and they held our reservation. The small plates allowed us to try many different dishes,5,Nycfoody,New York Area
"Excellent vegetarian meal that is not too expensive. Last visit was marred by the worst wine we've ever had - something from Oregon. Other than that, the buns are spectacular and the spring peas with curry dip was an exceptional treat. Looking forward to the next visit.",5,AmandaH,New York Area
"Delicious vegetarian/vegan dishes that anyone would enjoy in a modern, adult atmosphere.",4,OpenTable Diner,New England
"Really lovely food, but abrasively loud. They need to work on their acoustics before I'm willing to go back.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Great food and a destination restaurant for vegetarians. Inventive and unique, delicious dishes. We shared multiple plates and enjoyed the creative cuisine. Expensive but worth it for the experience. Very loud, making it difficult to have a group conversation at our table of 6.Overall, a fun place to try, especially for foodies!",4,OpenTable Diner,Minneapolis
Very inventive vegetarian. All in all a very nice experience.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Flavourful, exquisitely prepared vegetable dishes in shareable portions. Powerfully good at times. Grilled pineapple with tamarind? Maple custard? Rich. Worth it. Gluten-free/celiac guest handled well. Many options. (Sadly no great GF bread)  We left happy beyond our high expectations.",5,Maple,Toronto
"Thoughtfully designed restaurant, immaculately clean kitchen, even the staff's attire are in keeping with the squeaky clean atmosphere. The cuisine was exceptional. All the dishes were extraordinary. Table favorites were the gnocchi, cauliflower teriyaki with buns, amazing hummus. Asparagus with morels were also good, and the cucumber sorbet with blackberries refreshed the palate. I was so looking forward to the mushroom cacio e pepe, which was a bit disappointing in the sense that mushrooms seemed to need some pasta to hold the rich flavors of the cheese and pepper. Overall excellent. Congratulations and thank you to the chefs!",4,FinickyFlora,New York Area
"We didn't think we'd be full or the food would be so beautiful to eat, but it was. My friend, who doesn't drink alcohol, had a very nice list of drinks to choose from. Everything was delicious except the cucumber gelato probably wasn't the best choice for dessert. When you're eating vegetarian you want to think you're NOT eating vegetarian. We loved the ambiance and the service very much too. It was a lovely night spent at Nix.",4,W33kender,Toronto
The restaurant is lovely and the wait staff were attentive and friendly but the food was fair.   The bread and hummus were excellent but I had a bad reaction to the rice dish I ordered and was sick with stomach pain.,3,LeniT,New York Area
"Confusing menu re ingredients (not all Listed so you get something different than you ordered, including dietary problems like cheese) and even more confusing waiter who said all ingredients are listed (not). Small portions and scant use of vegetables, so that you're just getting a tasting not a meal. Super disappointing.",3,DeborahR,Richmond
Our dining experience was great! The food was prepared and presented very well.  Went here to celebrate our recent engagement and our waitress hooked us up with some complimentary champagne to celebrate.  The desert was one I shan't be forgetting soon!,5,Jeff,New York Area
Amazing gastronomic experience from beginning to end!,5,DEEPBAR,New York Area
I was hoping to like it better.   Decent but wasn't blown away by any dish.,3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Loved the food. Loved the service. 10/10. Will definitely go again!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"the food is divine, setting lovely  almost every dish I have tried in two visits with friends has been a winner.  The grilled asparagus and morels is superb.  The tandoori-roasted pineapple is flavorful and rich.  The melon salad refreshing.",5,CSRNYC,New York Area
Used the holiday weekend to finally get a 9:15 pm reservation here last night and was so happy we did.   The space is simple but really wonderful.   Started with the watermelon tequila foam cocktail - so delicate and tasty.   Had the egg salad and jicama small plates -- the egg salad was amazing with a slight kick -- not your orinary salad.   For larger played we had the gnocchi and mushroom pasta like dishes.   Truly fantastic    Nix is amazing    One draw back the air condition  -- I was freezing so be prepared with long sleeves,4,vegtraveler,New York Area
Great for vegetarians craving some variety in a restaurant menu. The wines by the glass were spectacular.,4,StevenN,New York Area
Loved Nix. Will definitely be back. Food was wonderful and so was the service. Nothing bad to say.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
The potato fry bread is outstanding. Not to be missed.,5,SusanC,New York Area

"Great vegetarian option, marvelous dishes, some unusual wine selections, a creative list of cocktails, very friendly and knowledgeable service.  A tad noisy...",4,Adacosta,Miami
"My 2nd meal, just as outstanding as the first.  Fabulous to FINALLY have a place where vegetarian AND vegan options are as sexy, beautiful and delicious as the best restaurants in NYC. Not just a bunch of side dishes served up as the main fare.  This chef is one talented man. Thank you.",5,MelissaC,New York Area
Great!! Excellent selection and tasty drinks,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The food is excellent, the service knowledgeable and attentive, and the setting inviting. This is a great place for vegetarians and vegans to bring their omnivore friends.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
The new additions to the menu are outstanding!  Try them!,4,EWLNYC,New York Area
"Nix is one of my favorite restaurants  to take my non-vegan friends too. They offer two menus, Vegan and Vegetarian, and my non veg friends always leave stating if they could cook like the chef at Nix they would be vegan/vegetarian too!",5,Beckwoman,New York Area
"The food was excellent as always, the ambiance very pleasant and the service was also very good except that they didn't do anything in reference to my boyfriend's birthday even though I let them know from the time I made the reservation that we were going to be celebrating this special occasion and I reminded them when I arrived at the restaurant.  That was a bit disappointing, especially since they assured me they had noted down the occasion when I came in.",4,RocioC,Dined 4 days ago
"Amazing food, friendly and flawless service. Highly recommended.",5,CatherineB,Dined 5 days ago
It is so good I eat here on each trip to NYC.  They need better signage.  I know exactly where it is but almost always walk right past it.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"NIX is amazing!  I am not a vegetarian. I generally think vegetarian restaurants are inferior in taste to those without such limitations to their ingredient lists. I generally find vegetarian restaurants try and fail to make alternate versions of meat dishes, that are shadows of their original dish.  NIX is different and superior. Its by far the best vegetarian restaurant I have eaten at, and more importantly, it is one of the best restaurants I have eaten at, period. I would recommend it to any and all purely for the great cuisine they offer with the bonus of ambiance and service.  In my mind the accomplish this by creating unique cuisine designed around the ingredients versus finding ingredient substitutes for formerly meat dishes. Every dish we had was a powerful unique experience of flavor and texture.  I greatly look forward to my next visit!",5,LordBritish,New York Area
We were expecting more tasty food. We felt like the food was pretty basic and yet expensive. The ambience is certainly good and the service is also good though.,3,OpenTable Diner,Las Vegas
Love Nix! Such creative food for a vegetarian diner. Have now tried dinner and brunch. Everything is delicious!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
I just asked them to bring me the most delicious food on the menu. And they did. :),5,OpenTable Diner,Raleigh
"Good quality, especially the main course and appetizers. Light fare solid.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
My daughter and I were confused by the high ratings. The food is a not particularly flavorful and the service was a bit awkward and lacked warmth.,2,Terski,Chicago
Went to Nix twice in a week. Tried their dinner and lunch menu both were great! Excellent service :),5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Our new favorite vegan/vegetarian restaurant in the city! So close to Union Square, it's going to be our go-to for pre-movie dining!  The food was fantastic, and our waitress was so helping in choosing the best of the best courses.  So much fun.  Will def be back!",5,FoodieMom,New York Area
Blown away by our meals. You won't be unhappy here with their amazing vegan options (even if you're a meat-eater). We'll be back!,5,OpenTable Diner,Philadelphia
"This place is FANTASTIC and saved me!!! I had to impress a foodie vegetarian friend and this place did not disappoint. She was amazed by the high quality and taste of every dish. The food was absolutely incredible, with many great choices. If I could eat like this every day, I would be a vegetarian in a heartbeat. Absolutely, the best vegetarian restaurant in NYC. Don't go elsewhere. Go here.",5,ultramet,New York Area
The restaurant was quiet and nice. The food was a few bucks overpriced for what it was. I found mine to be in need of salt which they do not provide on tables. Additionally it was just way more expensive than comparative restaurants which provide more value. I think if they dropped the price from $20 for cauliflower to 16 they would still make money but provide better value. Spent about $40 bucks on dinner and got some tempura cauliflower and a half an avocado with sesame seeds and garlic aioli. There is just better value elsewhere in this big city. Even for vegetarians.,3,Foodie,New York Area
"The food here is absolutely scrumptious. For reasons we don’t quite understand, there was an unusually long lag between our first and second courses, which made the end of the meal quite rushed. Otherwise a perfect choice!",4,Elisa,New York Area
"We did call Nix in advance who did think well in advance that they were offering a Restaurant Week menu. They were not in fact. Nonetheless, we tried the three different dips with the bread. We tried  interesting chewy dumplings and delicious cauliflower tempura dishes. Everything was colorful, tasty and hearty. My only criticism is that both of us found the selections a tad heavy. This was surprising. I think next time we would ask for more guidance in the selections.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
We always love it at Nix at the rail tables!,5,Villagehaunts,New York Area
"Although the food was excellent, we definitely felt as though we were rushed to eat and leave. Our food came out super fast, was removed immediately and the next course served right away. It was not a relaxed environment that encouraged us to relax and enjoy our time there. Considering the cost of the meal, it was an incongruity",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"On this, our second dinner at Nix, my wife ordered badly, as she had the first time. She wasn't happy with any of her dishes. I ordered well for the most part, and liked my food. But I tasted her servings and agreed with her assessments. We won't be back.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Very disappointed.  Had high expectations and they were not met. Gnocci had no taste! Very mediocre food,2,tex1,New York Area
"We had read a favorable review about this restaurant in the New Yorker and were excited to come to NYC to try it out. The concept of a creative vegetarian restaurant piqued our interest, (although we aren't vegetarians) and while the ambience bordered somewhere between soothing and minimalist, the overall vibe from the waitstaff was vague, dismissive, and pretentious. Our waitress pretended not to understand our simple questions regarding how to order off the intriguing menu. The food was ridiculously priced for what it was--vegetables. (I think we paid about $36 for a cauliflower dish. )The idea that the small plates could be shared (something  our waitress recommended) among 5 diners wasn't really feasible either. The food was perfectly fine, but not delightful, nor memorable. Everything veered towards bland rather than inventive in terms of taste.  No doubt, an enormous amount of work and thought had gone into the preparation of the food, but the end result was unfortunately just meh. I think if the chefs could amp up the taste profile and put a few more beans on the plate, and the front of house could drop the needless pretension (i.e. what's with the weird Johnnies the waitresses are required to wear?) the price point and overall experience might be easier to swallow.",2,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"As an almost life long vegetarian, I love to be given then the opportunity in an elevated dining experience. This meal was awesome.  Everything was really good and I would go back again and again !",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
A very impressive vegetarian menu plus delicious cocktails,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Loved our cocktails.  Very original. Also loved cauliflower fritters,5,Pafd,Toronto
"Excellent choice for a vegan and non-vegan couple as there are good choices on the menu for both. Atmosphere, food and service are top shelf.",4,DenPat,New York Area
"Not terrible, but it was extremely average compared to the glowing review in the New York Times.  We had the tandoor bread with the guacamole and the hummus. The hummus was average, whereas the guacamole was very good indeed. The bread was good, but burnt.  We had two entrees from the ""light"" section of the menu: The baby carrots, and the roasted tomatoes. Both were quite mediocre. The carrots, while slathered with fat and covered in nuts, tasted of nothing. The charred sungold tomatoes tasted like something we might whip up at home in five minutes; very basic, not what you expect at a high-end restaurant, and not even very good.  For mains we had the cauliflower tempura baos and the tofu-skin pockets with sweet potato. The baos were very good, even if you had to build the meal yourself. However, they were not any better than what you'd find in your average Chinese or Korean street food joint. The tofu-skin pockets were unremarkable.  As far as vegetarian menus go, drop this and go right to Wassail. Much better. With its attempt at fusion and small plates, Nix also reminded me of Xixa in Williamsburg, which is also much, much better. Xixa is not a vegetarian restaurant, but about half of their small-plates menu is vegetarian.",3,Alexander,New York Area
"Perhaps my expectations were too high but I was very disappointed in the food. I found most dishes quite ordinary save the cauliflower tempura, that was amazing. But one dish does not a restaurant make. The service was excellent. The noise level is typical of most restaurants today and that would be far too LOUD!!! I long for the days of quiet dining.",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"An incredibly creative dining experience. Overall the dishes were inventive and unusual, with a few misses, but all the more reason to go back and try something else. It strikes me that Nix will always be upgrading and tweaking. And you have to have the cauliflower tempura with steamed buns. The cocktails are delicious. Dessert needed a little work--it didn't seem to measure up to the vibrancy of the mains and small plates.",4,MarlaCo,New York Area
"All the food was outstanding!  For a table of carnivores, we did not miss the lack of meat even once.  Simply amazing and best new vegetarian addition to the city scene!",5,anair43,New York Area
We own Canada's premiere wellness retreat centre and was in NY on business. We googled top vegetarian restaurants in NY and NIX came up. As vegetarian foodies this restaurant shines! We loved it. It was our favorite food experience while in NY for three days.  Thank you and we'll be back.,5,OpenTable Diner,Toronto
the overall experience was delightful.  wonderful food attractive room very good service couldn't ask for more,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

Nix is fantastic! Everything from the food to the drinks to the ambiance was top notch. The meal was timed perfectly and not rushed. I can't wait to go back! the cauliflower is a must try,5,emorydiner,New York Area
Food was wonderful and staff were friendly and attentive.  But it's too loud to have even a minimal conversation.,5,OpenTable Diner,London
"On a hot summer night when most of the neighborhood restaurants were mostly-empty, NIX was doing good business, which tells you something--it's popular and should be:  very imaginative vegetarian/vegan menus (they actually have a physical menu that specifies what's vegan), thoughtful/helpful service, pleasant space, a bit on the expensive side (i.e. it's a real restaurant, not a vegetarian alternative...).  Well worth it.  Recommended...",5,DrLee,New York Area
"Vegetarian but far from dietetic. Several dishes great, several dishes meh. Best were jicama ribbons dressed with chili, delightful combination of crunch and spice. Local strawberries could have come from the grocery next door and portion was meager. Vanilla creme fraiche hit the mark. Naan ok, but dips too thick, not dippable, really spoonable.",4,eatress,Minneapolis
Excellent vegetarian fare.,5,RetiredGuy,New York Area
"Food a little overrated. Cauliflower tempura was over battered and way too sweet, tofu skin filling mushy. Good dips, morel asparagus crepe was good as was stir fry. Not a very diverse menu, lot of riffs on Asian or Mediterranean that are done better elsewhere.",3,OpenTable Diner,Houston
"Get their cauliflower tempura, and you will go to heaven. I would go back to Nix just to get the cauliflower tempura. Other dishes were good, but cauliflower tempura was the most memorable one. Definitely check out this place whether you are vegan or not.",5,JihyeunK,Washington DC
We had an excellent dinner experience  at Nix. The server helped us make our selections. Worked out perfectly for our party of five. Wonderful for a celebration or a quiet dinner. Beautiful restaurant.  Unique vegetarian dishes that our omnivore guest enjoyed as well. Loved each of our shared. 14 dishes. Wine selections and cocktails were superb. We will be back soon.,5,LadyLiberty,New York Area
"Such a delicious meal.  I don't typically eat vegetarian food, but this was excellent.  Can't wait to go back!",5,Superior,Los Angeles
Nix was truly an amazing experience. The food was exceptional and my only regret was that there wasn't a tasting menu; we would have loved to try absolutely everything. The service was brilliant and very reasonably for foodie fare. Overall this was the highlight of our trip to NYC.,5,CarlB,New York Area
"While visiting NYC from far away we arranged to dine on 2 occasions at Nix, which is close to our accommodation. The meals on both occasions were inventive, memorable and delicious; the service was friendly and efficient. The cost of the meal was consistent with the sophistication, thought, and care of preparation. Highly recommended.",5,KimB,San Francisco
"Great food in noisy setting.  This is among the best vegetarian restaurants in NYC.  Creative, tasty cooking.  Just bring the ear plugs.",4,Tony,New York Area
Very good vegetarian restaurant! Great dishes although some of the portions sizes were a bit too small. Our pea dumpling only had three tiny dumpling with couple of maitake mushrooms for $26!  Also the noise level was almost unbearable. The streets outside in NYC city felt so peaceful after the dinner. They need to do something to get the noise down.   I would try and go there again but perhaps with my Bose noise cancelling headphones,4,Weimarner,New York Area
"The food was incredible! We were torn on what to order as everything sounded amazing. The bread with avocado dip was fantastic and we had two small dishes and two large and could not manage dessert. Dishes of note were the Yukon potato bread, cauliflower buns and the egg salad. The waitress was lovely and really helpful and the restaurant is chic yet laid back. Although vegetarian it didn't feel consciously veggie a true testament. And I love a red Lambrusco so was really pleased to see it on the wine list. Next time we are in NY it's top of our list and we are real foodies!",5,LaurenH,Yorkshire
A great vegetarian adventure.  My only criticisms are tables too close together and silverware too thin.,4,KenN,New York Area
"Expertly conceived celebrations of vegetables. A much needed addition to the NYC dining-scape. The food is vibrant and memorable, and the space is perfect. The lighting and the atmosphere combine with an eclectic menu to really transport you somewhere else... We'll be back!",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
The ambiance and noise levels were perfect. Our waitress (Vanessa) was very involved in helping us make choices and explaining the composition of dishes. She had a good flow without being overbearing. The food was delicious!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Great food, everything exceeded my expectations.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Simply superb.  Better than the review in NY magazine suggests. THe service is wonderful and every dish is flavorful and filling. Our third visit, and we can't wait to go back",5,EVFoodie,New York Area
Thanks so much for having us both nights! The whole experience was perfect! The food is pure art!,5,BenV,New York Area
"Vegetables and vegetarians have a brand new champion. The menu is built on small, medium and large plates for  which servers provide helpful explanations and  recommendations. The flavors derived from seasonal greens and vegetables are astonishingly complex and satisfying.  The cauliflower ""pork"" buns are only one example.  The potato fry bread, like a giant potato and Cheddar fritter,   would satisfy the most out -of -his-or-her- element carnivore.  The service was sweet, freindly and very supportive, with our server consistently  hovering nearby  with additional serving suggestions, wine fillips and more.  Nix feels like an everyday neighborhood spot with special occasion food.  Go.",5,Purplepen11,New York Area
"At 48 years of age I've eaten in a lot of nice restaurants.  This is the BEST overall restaurant I've ever been too.  Fantastic service, original cocktails (yum), and the best curated food.  Each dish was better than the other, with complex yet beautiful flavors. AMAZING.  Ordered about 12 dishes for the two of us including 3 desserts.  BAM!  So good we are going back tonight, a mere 3 days later.  CAN'T WAIT!     Oh don't go there.  I want it to ourselves.",5,BenV,New York Area
"From a friendly welcome to a cordial thank you, and everything in between, this was a great experience.  We shared the three dips which were luscious, the  fried cauliflower pockets, slightly spicy, cooled by a smooth  sauce, the lemon dessert .... all unique and delicious. Along with good service and a great design, this made for a lunch place that we'll want to return to many times.",5,Delicious,New York Area

"One of my favorite restaurants, with an incredibly friendly staff.",5,Eddiecomic,New York Area
We took our out of town friends for Sunday brunch to this restaurant. We really enjoyed both vegan and vegetarian dishes and got to try interesting combinations. Deserts were very good and brunch cocktail menu was on point.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
The food was amazing. I LOVED what I had to eat!!! I was a little disappointed that a baby behind us was screaming bloody murder and the parents wouldn’t go outside or to the bathroom...but that’s just bad parenting and not a reflection of the restaurant. Lol,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I recommend you find out why the restaurant is named ""Nix""!  It's a great find; Michelin Star; very happy with our experience. They topped our desert with a sparkler unbeknownst to my wife or me as we were celebrating our 10-yr wedding anniversary.",5,PunditofFunk,Philadelphia
"Everything we ordered was delicious. The food was super creative and wonderful. My friend and I went for lunch and were blown away. It was late so restaurant was quiet, but they couldn’t have been nicer. Can’t wait to go back!",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Excellent menu, delicious creative vegetarian cuisine from one of the best in NYC, John Fraser. Casual well informed service. Our first time at Nix, we will be back!",4,finefoodie,New York Area
"Incredible food!! Didn't for a moment feel like it was a 'vegetarian' restaurant (in a good way). Very reasonably priced for the quality of food. I highly recommend it. The naan and dips were out of the world, as was the baked sweet potato covered with truffle shavings.",5,Meeks,New York Area
"While the food was outstanding (everything we ordered elicited a reaction of pure joy), the birthday dinner (with reservations) we planned for a friend ended on a sour note when we were pressured to leave. We had 3 different people come over in 5 minutes to see if there was ""anything else...?"" we needed as we were finishing dessert, and our final ""no, we're all set!"" was met with the check being plunked down, and 3 more staff members coming to clear plates and wipe crumbs off the table. We paid our bill right away, and as we were taking turns to run to the bathroom before heading out (as the table was being re-set under our elbows) the hostess assured the next guests that we were ""JUST LEAVING"" and their table ""WILL BE READY IN A MINUTE."" This was not said quietly; it was shouted as she turned to face us while we scrambled for our coats. Not a fun way to end a special birthday dinner. Too bad, because the food really is a delight.",3,UWSgirl,New York Area
"not horrible, but the food was just... meh. service was inattentive. i've had better vegetarian meals for less money elsewhere.",3,name,Philadelphia
"My partner and I went. It was his birthday and I know he's very particular, so right away I appreciated the clean, sleek, and not overdone look of the place. Can't recall if there was background music or not but that did not matter, as the sound of the diners was one that comforted, as it's the ambient noise of people enjoying their food, and that's the best! Oh, and the food was awesome, that cauliflower tempura is the business!",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"More than a meal, the serving style makes it into a full experience to share with the people you're with. Really hearty and filling food, even for a meat eater, but never too much - we had just the right amount. It's pricey but not insane, and the quality is out of this world.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Love the food at NIX!!! Everything we ordered was amazing. The service, however, left a lot to be desired. It was horrible. We were basically ignored once we were seated and the wait staff did not check on us during our meal.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Marvelous food and great atmosphere! Service is outstanding - our server knew everything about this food and gave us great suggestions. Definitely coming back again.,5,KonstantinW,New York Area
Perfect up market veggie restaurant in the village. We chose well but still got jealous of other people’s food around us so must go back soon to try it all! Small intermate restaurant ideal for a couple or group of 4. Wonderful service.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Wow! Nix could make anyone give up meat. Just great!,5,OpenTable Diner,Minneapolis
"I was impressed by the look of the restaurant,the freshly ironed napkins,the way the hostesses were dressed and the food was very tasty for a vegetarian restaurant. But it is really expensive when you estimate how much a dish of vegetables cost. I think the owners are raking it in. Bravo for them the food is delicious.",4,vross2000,New York Area
Were seated 25 minutes after our reservation with no compensation and rude service,2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"NIX has outstanding food, very attentive staff, and a sommelier that is a true master of wines.   The vegetarian dishes are very creative, and –dear carnivores– you'll forget that there is no meat, thanks to the variety of flavors that spark all sorts of associations.",5,DanielD,New York Area
Excellent cuisine &amp; service! I was impressed with creativity behind the menu,5,Grad82,New York Area
"One of the best meals I have had. I am no vegetarian, but am an honorary one due to my wife's predilection for vegetables. And this meal oozed every drop of flavor and texture out of each vegetable featured. I will be craving the cauliflower tempura, and the mushroom whatever-it-was for years, until I can make it back to NYC for another visit.",5,Rabbit,Columbus
Creative menu and excellent cooking.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
The sommelier Andrea was the highlight of our visit - she's so knowledgeable and has great taste! The food was so wonderful! As a vegetarian I often have a hard time winning over my meat-eating husband but he was equally wowed! It was the perfect way to celebrate my birthday!,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Absolutely amazing!!! Go and enjoy!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

Imaginative vegetarian menu; very attentive &amp; knowledeable wait staff; Good wine list;  jolly if noisy atmosphere.,5,JudithC,New York Area
It's always incredible to go into a restaurant and be able to eat everything on the menu; it's another experience when there is an additional menu with variations in case you're a vegan instead of simply a vegetarian.   Extremely excellent.,5,noonis,New York Area
"excellent service, wonderful appetizers, much better than main courses. Loved the sparkling red wine. Attentive waitress who was more than willing to explain and answer any menu questions.",4,limelee,New York Area
awesome! was extremely delicious. would be good for a vegetarian or a non-vegetarian,5,HATF,Chicago
Interesting new restaurant,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Innovative and delicious menu. A great place to eat if staying in the area. Service was excellent. We found the restaurant noisy at times as it was full even at 9:15pm when we were directed to our table. Mood lighting was effective.,5,GiovannaM,Sydney / NSW
"Second visit confirmed how special NIX is. Menu is full of surprising combinations of fresh ingredients, flavors and textures that may make little sense of the page but make a lot of sense when consumed.  There were some changes to menu since last visited less than two months ago, but still plenty of new selections to try plus old favorites to revisit.  Service is relaxed &amp; welcoming but very professional. There is just right combination of attentiveness without any ""hovering"" and every from wait staff to servers to busing well organized.  Nick is a keeper; friendly, knowledgable and enthusiastic about the food.  The atmosphere is just right for ""upscale"" Village. Great to have tables placed so some breathing room, rather than being crammed together to maximize revenue without regard for diner comfort as is so often the case these days.  When in full swing, the noise level at NIX gets in the way pop quiet conversation. Its not painful as with many new restaurants, but could be better. However, probably not possible given dimensions of place and materials of decor.",5,ArthurL,New York Area
"Being Vegetarian one is wary of ""Vegetarian"" restaurants in the US....Our food was outstanding and the service was impeccable. Every dish we ordered has it's own unique flavour and the presentation was also amazing.....Must have the grilled pineapple dessert with caramelised coconut and macadamia nuts....We met Chef ""John"" and complimented him and now understand why it was so delectable.....He Is Vegetarians! It was truly an ambrosial and exquisite experience.....",5,AP1962,New England
"Wonderful spot for two vegetarian friends and one omnivore. The dishes were unique and enjoyed by all. This is not your typical vegan spot with loads of ""fake meat"" which I like but did not miss! Want to live here!",4,HollyL,New York Area
"The waitstaff was very attentive, the cocktail list was superb, and the food was great. I very much appreciate the attention to vegan details.",5,MeghanW,Philadelphia
Food was really good and very interesting. Would definitely go back to try more things on the menu.   Skip the cocktails and go for wine. Didn't think the drinks were that great.   Service was very slow. Felt like our waitress kept forgetting us,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"First time dining at Nix. Great cocktails, interesting menu, excellent bread and dips. The room has no sound insulation and is thus very loud, unpleasantly so. The staff have the seriousness of cult members, guardians of veganism and vegetarianism. Kind of cute and abrasive.",3,Michael10003,New York Area
I love the place and the food.  It's an amazing addtion to our neighborhood  Been there are few times.  Only issue is the waitress encourages us too order too much food,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Amazing ingredients served with style.  Great drinks &amp; wine list.  Terrific service.  All enjoyed in a cool &amp; stylish dining room - a really wonderful dining experience.,5,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
"I was so excited to try such a great, new vegan/veg restaurant when visiting my daughter in NYC.  The ambiance was classy and our server, Vanessa, attentive without being over the top.  We enjoyed two dips with our vegan Tandoor bread: red pepper walnut and avocado mint ginger, both delicious.  Our mains of morrell mushrooms and asparagus and an asparagus , nectarine and the most delicious home made cottage cheese left us sated and totally pleased.",5,OpenTable Diner,Louisville
"Loved dining here! Came here for my boyfriend's birthday and the inside feels super warm and the ambiance is cozy. The plates we shared were all amazing, my favorite being the cauliflower in  steamed bao buns. We got the tandoor bread to start with the Labneh &amp; marinated  cucumbers (highly recommend! so fresh), and the charred Avocado a la plancha which our waitress recommended to us. We tried one of the house sodas (blackberry) which was good but not as flavored as we'd like.  Overall service and food all great!",5,emilysjun,Philadelphia

Each item on the menu seemed to be worth calling for. All the dishes we got were just so delicious!! Will be going back there to order the ones that we couldn't do that day! Very good value for such innovative cuisine.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I'm usually not vegetarian, but that dinner was amazing good! Friendly staff, nice location, just a perfect evening!",5,OpenTable Diner,Berlin
"Nix is amazing! It is a well appointed, with simple but beautiful decor, excellent and friendly service and wonderful vegan food (although they also have vegetarian). It's a small bite menu of very unique and very well seasoned food. We loved our drinks too! The dessert was AWESOME! A pineapple that had been cooked in a tandoori oven with yummy nuts and dairy free sauce to top it off. Best vegan desert we have ever had! Highly recommend this spot.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
The food is totally remarkable. Extraordinary combinations of ordinary vegetables. You still need a menu beside you to understand what it is in your flavorable dish but the noise level makes eating at NIX torture.,2,ElStuarto12,New York Area
Nice addition to the area which I thought might become popular with the University crowd. But its way too expensive for vegetarian food - as good as the food was. I would have think very seriously about making a second visit - unless it was a special occasion,4,ClaudioF,New York Area
"OUTSTANDING!!!! An amazing new restaurant in it's own right, not to mention the V thing. I've never seen such great menu items for both veggie and vegan options.  Tried many dishes and all fantastic.  Hummus ""standby"" best in class. Our server, Nick, was so knowledgeable and fun.  Brought us great suggestions from the kitchen. Went to eat there from an inside tip from the great Jean George Himself.  A truly amazing, delicious and fantastic night.  THANK YOU!",5,MelissaC,New York Area

"We were looking for a place to eat in Destin and online searches recommended the Crazy Lobster.  The atmosphere was very nice and casual - we sat outside so it was a nice area for people watching and it was next to the lagoon.    The service was very good and the food came out generally fast.  The food was decent - we ordered two  platters and a salad.  Given the higher price, we were expecting a larger platter.  The platter was enough for one maybe two people.  For the price, the platter was neither big enough nor as tasty.    Overall, good service, nice atmosphere, average food, smaller portions, and high prices",2,DukesMaui,New Orleans
The food was not very good and the place was very loud. This is more of a bar than a restaurant and it’s not one to bring a family to.,2,Jas28,Kansas City
Service was great!  Food was prompt and excellent!,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Service was great ! Guy was impressive remembered everything we told him table of 8  he didn't miss a beat  Bad news   Ordered the most expensive lobster plate, blackened lobster . Decent sized lobster but they brought it and it had no front claws . Most expensive lobster dish on menu and not much meat ... not sure how this made it on open table . Their better than that . They specialize in 2 foot tall fruity drinks if your into that !!!!   Didn't line up with other stuff on open table . Not our cup of tea .  Won't be back",3,OpenTable Diner,Nashville

Staff complaining about their jobs,1,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"The restaurant reviews to close out our reservation must’ve been for at least a week because I was never able to go on and write a review about this place for a long time. I wasn’t surprised they knew we weren’t happy we walked out. The place is disgusting, one of our drinks had a dead fly in, every employee there had an attitude, They gave a guy on his first night at work our eight top table and pretty much left him alone. When we complained about the slow service getting drinks then the fly and I drink then we look over and realize that this thing next to us is supposed to be a lobster tank and it’s so overgrown with green algae that PITA I would’ve sued. We were just so grossed out by the condition, the filth and the fact they were out of almost everything we wanted to order. The Owner comes out and she has a huge attitude and is acting like we’re trying to get something over on her. We told her we’re not trying to get comped we’re trying to tell her what’s wrong with her restaurant and that these conditions are inexcusable and we’re not sure how she’s open. We should’ve known when they hung up on us and had huge attitude when we called several times trying to figure out how to get there because the GPS is wrong on the Maps that we should’ve just gone somewhere else to begin with. We paid for what we ordered including the drink with the fly in it and we tip the poor kid who is waiting on us his first night very generously for his trouble and advised him to find a better job. You can’t make tips if people are always walking out. Save your vacation dollars and go someplace else on that warf.",1,LFrach,St. Louis
Main courses excellent but we did not like the appetizers at all. They were all a little strange. However the desserts are quite good especially the olive oil ice cream.,3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Excellent food and service.  This time we ate in the dining room.  We also have eaten in the bar which is also wonderful.,5,bobbybrat,San Francisco
"Super Bowl night so very quiet. Octopus appetizer was awful, no taste and dry rubbery octopus. Beets with pistachios was better, but also pretty bland. Pizza Quattro Formagi was okay. Crispy crust, but not great. The service was good. Probably because it was so quiet. I had been here years ago, and it was much better then.",3,ASMA,New York Area

I was a little disappointed in the pizza, but the pasta and veggies were delicious and the cheese plate for dessert was the perfect ending to the meal.",4,LocalFoodie,New York Area
I called ahead and requested a birthday candle for our table to be brought out during dessert. The waitress did not follow thru and I was extremely disappointed singing happy birthday with no candle in any of our desserts. Hostess and waitress need to coordinate special requests.,4,Kristina,Washington DC
"Price of wines by the glass, drinks, and beer was ridiculous— wine by the bottle list was way too long and unreadable -  Service was ok but not very friendly nor helpful in providing recommendations. Overall, a forgettable experience.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

Cacio pepe pizza is the best pizza you will ever have!,5,kris,New York Area
"Otto has great food and cocktails - everything was delicious. The downside the to the evening was the service. We had an 8:45 reservation, and the waitstaff obviously just wanted to get out of there (although there were a good two dozen tables with diners when we entered and many still there when we left).   First, we were placed at a terrible table when there were many other better tables available. It requires one of us to squeeze in behind a door.   Second, someone came by and from a distance of about three feet away literally tossed a bag of breadsticks and some wrapped up bread. No offer to provide olive oil or butter - just plain bread.   Third, we ordered and enjoyed the food, but they rushed out the main course two minutes after dropping off appetizers.   The food was great, but we were rushed in and out of there in thirty minutes. If I wanted a fast-food experience, I’d go somewhere else.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

It is wonderful!,5,Jochiz,Las Vegas
The food was top notch.  My steak was cooked to perfection and as tasty as any I have ever had.   My wife had the shrimp and grits and really enjoyed them.  Our waiter was also very good.   Knew when to talk and when to just let us enjoy our meal.  We will be coming back.,5,OpenTable Diner,Dallas

"Bijoux is a top choice for diners along the Emerald Coast.  Great food served in an upscale environment by a seasoned waitstaff are Bijoux hallmarks.  We have been to Bijoux many times but this was our first New Years Eve dinner.  The dinner was a four course fixed prix affair but you were offered at least 5 options at each course.  Our group sampled virtually the entire menu and loved every course.  Despite the full restaurant the service was attentive, the food was delicious and the cocktails were spot on.  The wine list is reasonably priced and offers a decent variety of European and US wines.  Great choice for your next upscale meal.",5,JC93,Tallahassee
Typically you should expect slower service at this restaurant.  However on New Years Eve it was incredibly slow....nearly 3 hours for our party of three (6:45PM to 9:25PM).   For the cost you should get better!,3,OpenTable Diner,Houston
"Service was professional and courtious. Food choices were considerate with something available for various palets. Inviting atmosphere with a nice warm ambiance. Quality of food was right on and well presented. The only concern was the overall price. If I am going to pay $350.00 for a dinner and four drinks, I expect the staff to offer to take our heavy coats and hang them so we don't have to oddly hang an over coat off the back of our chairs. Any silver service establishment will extend that coutesy. With a such a top price point, the little things start to matter. The food and experience was very nice but I would be very reluctant to pay that much again.",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee

Cacio pepe pizza is amazing!! Best pizza in tbe world!!,5,kris,New York Area
"This was my second time at Otto and I was less than impressed. The chopped Otto salad was not good - dressing and mix of ingredients was not pleasing. We also ordered the special black truffle pasta, which was fine - but didn't highlight the truffles very much. The pizza - goat cheese - was odd. Fine, but odd. The chunks of squash on top were huge, in comparison to the very thin pizza, making it an odd thing to eat. We ordered an apple dessert, which was fine. The coffee, however, was outstanding and the best part of the meal.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"This was some of the worst food I've ever eaten. Cheese pizza did the impossible - it tasted bad. The Pesto pasta, although covered in tons of sauce, tasted like absolutely nothing.

"Otto has been a go-to neighborhood restaurant for our family for many years because of its wonderful food, dependable menu, family-friendly ambience, lovely staff and great space. It’s been a gem! However, my wife and I were both of the opinion that the most fundamental reason for visiting any restaurant – the food – is no longer what it used to be at Otto.  Staples such as the Margherita Pizza, Soup of the day, etc. were disappointing. We’d hate for this wonderful restaurant to go but if this is what passes as representative of  what the kitchen has to offer (nowadays) then we won’t be back, and I can’t see how you’d could continue to cater to loyal and new clientele on the back of what was served to us. It wasn’t bad, but it wasn’t Otto good, which was its point of difference.",3,ElGuapo,New York Area

Wine choices are great and they let you try wines before you purchase.,3,THEOdeon2016,New York Area
Il posto è carino ed accogliente (buona selezione di vini) ed i piatti sembrano bueno ma se avete voglia di pizza (è quello che stavo cercando io) lasciate stare. Chissà non è la loro specialità però per un italiano (e non solo) la pizza è tutta un’altra cosa.,2,Edomoro,New York Area
"Excellent food , service, never fails to provide a 5 star experience",5,OpenTable Diner,Nashville

Excellent as always!  We had a wonderful meal and Mike was always on point!,5,OpenTable Diner,New Orleans
The grouper was over cooked after I asked for it to be slightly undercooked.  Was not given a new dish or compensated for the fish that was dry and tasteless.  Will not return or recommend.,3,nlgcoach,Washington DC
Nice atmosphere with excellent service.   Our waitress was very accommodating and the bartender was excellent.  The food is average.  The food is over priced.,4,Jawtag,Detroit
"Excellent wine, we really enjoyed ourselves!  Everything that our waiter suggested was very good,  She even suggested the wine we chose and it was excellent...we will be back again.",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
Wonderful!,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"From the moment we entered Bijoux, we were greeted and treated with gracious hospitality. Our waitress, Melissa was a delight. Our party of seven, was thrilled with our entrees. The desserts and after dinner drinks were divine. A lovely time, to celebrate the Christmas season and a beloved friend’s birthday!",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"Great food, service, and atmosphere. It was fancy and the service was just right, not over the top, timing of courses were perfect. Dress nice.",5,OpenTable Diner,Las Vegas
Great overall meal and experience.   Staff was very attentive and my filet was perfect.,5,OpenTable Diner,Nashville
"Bijoux always makes the evening special. Great food, great service, exceptional wine list and wonderful atmosphere.  We've never been disappointed!",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
Our waitress was super sweet! What a pleasant dinner for my mom and I.,5,OpenTable Diner,New Orleans
Far exceeded our expectations!!!  Superb dining experience.,5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
Had dinner here last week for the first time in years.  One of the best restaurants in town!  The ribeye is as good or better than you’ll get anywhere.,5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
Great food! Best steaks in town and also some of the best seafood. Brought our daughter and 3 teenage granddaughters and everyone cleaned their plates. Server was very attentive and sociable. She advised the girls that they could put any side they saw with any entree. Wine and dessert suggestions were wonderful.  Very pleasant evening. Everyone wants to back next time.,5,Redhummer,Atlanta
Outstanding in every way! We've been coming since beginning &amp; never disappointed. Chef Jack &amp; all go out of their way to make you feel special.,5,keithg,Las Vegas
"THE BEST restaurant in Destin.  From Wine and Apps to Dinner and Specialty cocktails nothing isn't amazing.   If you are looking for a special night out that you will talk about for days past, go to Bijoux.",5,MollyRose,Tallahassee
"Dinner was outstanding, but what made the evening extra special was the genuinely friendly and balanced attentive service we received from Michael. His enthusiasm for, and knowledge of, the food and its preparation make him a partner in what makes Bijoux such a special experience. While we reside in Pittsburgh, Bijoux will be on our ""must do"" list next time in the Gulf. The food and the experience were worth more than we paid.",5,OpenTable Diner,Pittsburgh
Great place. Great smalls plates with great pizzas and pasta dishes. Super wine list.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Good food, fast service.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Low quality of food. Not sure why chef insists of changing the traditional pesto sauce for a parsley sauce which is really bad. The pizza's sauce tasted like tomato paste, and the goat cheese pasta was horrible. This was my second time in two years and definitely my last.",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Very good experience however we felt rushed. Our main dish was served before starters were half finished . I understand that the holidays are a busy time and we were allotted 2 hours but we we back on the street in less than 90 minutes.,4,Claudia,Montreal
"Fantastic pizza , pastas and salad! Great wine list with a very knowledgeable Sommelier!",4,SGFA,New York Area
"Tater totos, tacos, Montauk Mules, lobster rolls, lobster mac and cheese, are amazing!",5,MariaA,Washington DC
"Solid if not inspired food, but pleasant neighborhood casual place with decent prices and friendly staff. Sunday brunch was dead (which was welcome) but often it is quite vibrant at night. Good for souped up basics and bar food.",4,ecpnyc,New York Area
"Staying at a hotel down the street and was looking for a quick bite to eat without waiting in line.   Management accommodated us quickly and personally took care of our table ( They had a surprise wedding party show up that wasn't planned for ). Fire roasted oysters were excellent, I decided on the grilled chicken salad which was surprisingly wonderful with the lemon vinaigrette dressing. Side note:  I don't always eat this healthy, but was on vacation and haven't had a chance to exercise lately.  My wife splurged with the fish and chips and she said it was tasty.",5,OpenTable Diner,San Antonio
"The restaurant was empty at 12pm.  The service was very good.  The food was hit or miss.  The fried shrimp deviled eggs were very good as were the tater tots.  Everything went down hill from there.  The fish tacos although crunch were tasteless.  The nachos were very basic, and the pancakes were very small.",3,mryanhyde,New York Area
"It was good but didn't have either beers I wanted, one was a corona.. and he then brought he one similar and had to pay for the beer... decent service and decent food. Go ambiance and date place. My date and I agreed 3.6 out of 5",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"We went to a movie at the Film Forum a block away and came here for dinner.  Not sure at 8:00 pm we were prepared for as dark a bar as this is.  Lots of surfing movies and also sports.  Not fine dining.  The waitperson was nice and friendly and service was fine.  Hard to read the menu in the dark.  For two draft beers, a vietnamese wrap and two tacos with tax and tip $56.  Not expensive but not a cheap eat.  The tacos were great and the vietnamese wrap a bit on the tasteless side, but fresh.  It came with a good sized and tasty green salad.  I don't think we would go back, but the ambiance for the younger was good.",3,notoutallthetime,New York Area
"Disappponted. Everything was bland and under-seasoned. The service was not very enthusiastic and was unhelpful in ordering. The drinks were not impressive. I would not return, and judging from the restaurant being nearly empty at 8pm, I assume they struggle with repeat business.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Brunch on a Saturday was incredible!!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I was excited to visit a Marc Murphy restaurant and found this location convenient to our hotel. My husband and I both had fried fish preparations--he had the fish and chips meal and I ordered the fish tacos. We each found our dish to be excellent, in taste and portion size. We would definitely visit again and recommend to others.",4,PamelaW,Memphis
Food was uniformly good.  Service was very good. Place was empty and a bit pricey for what you get.,4,ahs87,New York Area
"Reliable place to go.  Good food, dinner, apps, good drinks.",4,Robert,New York Area
"Good small plates - deviled eggs with shrimp, and the jalapeño cheddar tater tots. The spam and fried oyster sandwich was just OK. Good cocktails- beer selection is OK",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
The lobster rolls are on my top 3 best places in NYC. The Montauk mules are delicious for summer!,5,MariaA,Washington DC
Great happy hour!!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
We want to move closer so we can come here all the time! Great ambiance and service. Went for the seafood but wound up having chicken burgers  and hot dogs with mac and cheese  (it was Memorial Day Weekend and as close as we were getting to a barbecue).   Only downside was the very small number of wines available by the glass.  Can't wait to go back,5,livinginnyc,New York Area
"The lobster rolls and Montaulk Mules are the perfect combo for a summer afternoon. The lobster mac and cheese is amazing as well. Rob is the best bartender there, always so nice!",5,MariaA,Washington DC
"One of my favorite neighborhood joints for creative cocktails and comfort food. Service can be a bit slow at times, but otherwise top notch. The lobster mac &amp; cheese is heaven in your mouth and there are so many great app options (bring a group to try them all).",4,CrunchyFries,New York Area
"Kind of disappointing, we felt the lobster roll was way over seasoned, all you tasted was tarragon and didn't taste the lobster.",3,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Good West Village lunch option, close to West 4th St subway too.  Kudos to the bartender for his excellent music playlist.",5,mhill157,New York Area
"Great food, prompt service. It was  a little loud but there was a large party going on the night we were there. The dining areas are surrounding the bar so the entire place is a little on the loud side. Overall very good!",4,hvillediner,Birmingham
"I loved the food at this restaurant and it came highly recommended by friends. The one issue during my visit was, one person in our party had a shellfish allergy and we found out that all the food is fryed in the same fryolater oil as shrimp,  so he could not really eat anything on the menu that was fried which was disappointing.  We were planning to order the calamari or guacamole and chips and he normally would eat those no problem,  but he could not touch them.  He would have liked french fries but did not get those either. I would have assumed since a shellfish allergy is not an uncommon one, and they have so many friend items on the menu that they may separate the oils.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Food was excellent. Deviled eggs were delicious. Totally would come back again,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
We loved this neighborhood spot. My hungry 15 year old son appreciated that the starters were large. Delicious!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
They were super accommodating to get us a larger table when we needed it! Food is super comforting - fries nice and hot!,4,opentablereviewsmb,Washington DC
There was a dog sitting on a woman's lap at the next table ! At one point I saw that the dog had his paws on the table and was licking the table ! Not a place I would ever go back to.,3,Ronalorena,New York Area
We had a great evening with lovely fingerfood. Great atmosphere and very relaxed.,4,OpenTable Diner,London
Great food - sweet waitress but a bit forgetful (we never got our sides).,3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Average food for high price. And I'm a West village native of 11 years.  Average service, had to ask for everything.  TV sports bar vibe in what should be a nicer environment to reflect the feeling of Montauk, a place I visit frequently.  Do not recommend compared to all the other choices in the neighborhood",1,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The food was good, however I would come back for appetizers and drinks only",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Thought this would be more of a restaurant, but it was a bar setting.",3,GabV,New York Area
"This place used to be great. They have become more of a hot dog joint while raising their prices significantly. When I almost fell out of my chair at being charged SIX DOLLARS for an ICED TEA, I thought it was in error. ""That's the West Village,"" responds the server. No, dude: it's how little you think of your customers. Been going here for 10+ years. No mas.",1,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Great food and value for the $, in a cool little corner of the West Village. It is so dark however, that you cannot read the menu without using the flashlight app on your phone, which the server recommended.",4,ecpnyc,New York Area
"We went back to Ditch Plains after many years -- we missed the lobster roll and pear martini (no longer on the menu, alas!). The lobster roll was as we remembered it (except that it was served with French fries rather than sweet potato fries, in my view an improvement). The menu has changed, bu the quality remains.",4,NJvisitor,New York Area
Prices seems to go up and food was not very tasty as it has been in the past. Just because its summer and the restaurant is not crowded doesn't mean a drop in the quality of the food and a raise in price. Many brunch places make a bloody Mary or Mimosa from scratch and do not charge the same price as Ditch,2,DavidA,Los Angeles
Very good food but a little too noisy too early in the night Would gladly go back,5,OpenTable Diner,New England
"Ok finger, bar food. Not much on the ambiance.",3,Skip,New York Area
"Met here with cousins on a Thursday night. Practically empty which should have been a sign. Not terrible, but the seafood didn't taste fresh. Tuna burger was especially fishy. Decent vibe and good drinks but wouldn't recommend for a meal.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Went for brunch with friends. The Eggs Benedict with crabmeat was terrific. The yogurt pancakes not so much. Leaden belly bombs with little flavor.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Nice find.  We sat at the bar even though we had a reservation.  Friendly bartender, food was good, nice laid-back, upscale casual vibe.  Definitely recommend.",4,Fantastic,New York Area
Food is consistent but not a lot of options for vegetarian/vegan diners.,4,SamanthaA,New York Area
"It's hard to say what's better: the food, the service or the wine because they are all phenomenal. The quality of the food is second to none. The 4-course seasonal menu is the way to go. The 6-course tasting is also incredible and you get a lot of off-menu gems.  This restaurant does not have the pretentious vibe that most high-end places do and the servers really do make sure you have a fantastic evening.  They have a very well-curated wine list, but the best option is to let your server pair wine with your dinner. They all have fantastic wine knowledge, especially Aly, and they don't go overboard and pour their most expensive stuff.  It's hard to say what my favorite part of my meal was because everything works in perfect harmony.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
The food was excellent and the back room was very enjoyable. The 2 person tables in the main dining room are way too close together; we were happy to be able to sit in the back room. Service was top-notch too; attentive without being overbearing.,4,OpenTable Diner,Philadelphia
"Four-course tasting menu was phenomenal, as was the restaurant's flexibility with certain dietary restrictions (such as being a vegetarian).",5,kp57,New York Area
"Delicious food, fantastic service. Amazing bartender creating great cocktails while we waited for our table. We love the small intimate dining room.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I came for my birthday dinner and it was amazing! Food, service, ambiance.... everything was superb!",5,Lulu128,New York Area
"What a find!! Interesting concept...had to ask why the wait staff were dressed so informally. The answer...didn't want to do anything to upstage the food. My opinion, they could been in Tuxedos and it wouldn't have upstaged the food.  We will be back.",5,Candy,New York Area
"For some reason, Mas does not get as much notice as it should. Of course, the restaurant is fully booked on a Wednesday night so everyone who eats there knows it is one of the best finds in New York. But, the star systems does not do it justice. The service is so helpful and knowledgable about the dishes and wines, the ambience is one of the most elegent yet cozy places in the city. And the chef has a great mission to use local and seasonal foods in super creative ways. I have recommended Mas to my friends and family visiting to the city and they all have loved it. I had not been to the city and 5 years and Mas was still as fantastic as ever. It is a place I will dine at every time that I come to NYC. Other restaurants dissappoint after Mas",5,Melsopinion,Portland
"Mas is an elite restaurant for food, drinks, and service. I was pleased throughout my time there.",5,Qpine,New York Area
"great food, solid everything, maybe just a teeny bit expensive",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I have been going to this restaurant for a few years and it is good to see that the food and ambience are as god as ever. Probably one of the best meals in the Village.  Which makes it all the more surprising that they have such a bad attitude at the front desk -- nearly ruining the experience of dining there. Even if you are on time for your reservation, without special requests, and a time when the restaurant is nearly empty, you still have to put up with a lot of nonsense, which shoud be beneath them.  It made me question whether it is worth going back there.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"This was a fine meal. However given the prices and caliber of what it aims to me, it was disappointing. The service was warm although not particularly personalized. We ordered the 6 course tasting menu. other tables who got the same also received a cheese course which we did not.The pacing was pretty slow which was okay. They did make accomodations (I requested the lobster dish and a chocolate dessert for my husband) about preferences which most tasting menus don't (a lot of flexibility of how to order). The palate cleanser (apple graintee, green apple sorbet, and vanilla pannacotta) as well as the champagne were the highlights of the meal for me.Everything else was just okay. I won't be returning.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
The food was delicious and the service was really very good. The staff takes great care to make sure that your experience is a good one.,5,Ochomama,Richmond
"Quite simply - perfect. Attentive service, without being over the top. Lovely balance of flavours in all dishes and delightful atmosphere. Thoroughly recommended.",5,OpenTable Diner,London
"Mas is almost always a delight to visit, however this Thanksgiving it fell a little short. We waited more than 40 minutes before our first course appeared (although the staff noted the delay and gave us more wine). Overall, it just seemed like it wasn't ready for Thanksgiving.",3,JS11,New York Area
The coat check is a disaster! One tiny closet crammed full of coats in a mismanaged jumble.,5,Mumsa,Salt Lake City
"the food is simple yet perfectly prepared. The flavors were all so light, not muddled, but intense and distinct. Really incredible skill in elevating the flavors without overburdening the dishes with cloying sauces, or over salted proteins. One of the most consistent and enjoyable food experiences we've ever had in the city. Unexpected surprise was the complete flexibility of the menu...you can basically arrange the Prix Fixe any way you want with entrees as appetizers, and vice versa. The one negative was the cramped space...not the most comfortable place for a 6'4'' guy.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Every course that we had was fantastic. Great flavors, wonderful service. We will be back!",5,Ctdiner,New York Area
The most amazing dinner all around from the service to the food. Worth the price! We will be back next time we are in the city!!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Fresh ingredients; mediocre kitchen; overcooked, unrefined. Pleasant, modern rustic chic ambiance. Contemporary music.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"our cabbie got lost but we finally found Mas late on a sunday nite. Had a lovely dinner with 6 or 8 other late diners. Food, service, wine and company were wonderful. It was our best experience in a long New York weekend of food and shows. We will go back",5,OpenTable Diner,Baltimore
My husband and I went to Mas Farmhouse for his birthday. We had heard great reviews from friends and the experience surpassed our expectations. My husband had the 6 course chefs tasting menu and couldn't get enough of the sweetbread. The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating when it came to substituting dishes on the pre-fixe menu. I look forward to eating there again!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
I highly recommend this restaurant. It feels like a French farmhouse and the food and service are excellent.,5,Sarah,New York Area
"Excellent food and wine in a relaxed, charming atmosphere. Friendly and attentive (but not intrusive!) service. Long wait between appetizers and entrees, but we went the night the restaurant reopened after Hurricane Sandy, which might have had something to do with the delay. In any case, it was no problem--gave us a good opportunity to chat with our friends.",5,OpenTable Diner,Washington DC
"The service was inattentive and surprisingly so for a restaurant of this quality and price. In particular, the service was slow, the explanation of the menu was poor, and after we paid our bill no one thanked us or said goodbye as we left the restaurant.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I was disappointed with the food this time. Last time it was delicious. I was very surprised. My husband and I ordered a total of eight dishes. We didn't like one dish.. The dessert was too salty for our liking. We ended up stoping on our way home to try to take the taste out of our mouth. We dined at mas before and grillade twice. We enjoyed it eact time except Sunday night. The menu options were pretty bland to begin with. The summer bean salad was described with truffle oil. We both ordered it, I couldnt taste the truffle oil. The lobster risotto was the dish I was looking most forward too and he dish I was most disappointed with. It was terrible.. My husband was convinced by the waitress that the chiken wasn't boring, it was!Never again",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Delicious but terribly overpriced and the risotto was over cooked.,3,OpenTable Diner,Los Angeles
very good food nice atmosphere helpful kind wait staff but very late with seating very slow with service very small portions.,2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"This was my birthday celebration with my partner, and Mas did not disappoint. The food (chef's tasting) was executed brilliantly, and the wine pairings were inspired. The service is always the perfect balance of restrained-solicitious -- the servers are so informed, yet they also seem to love their jobs. So, they make you feel so comfortably at home. Bravo!",4,Ross,New York Area
I truly enjoyed the food!!!! all made from local fresh products.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Had my family in town so wanted to take them someplace for foodies. Amazing food. Great winelist. Very helpful service. Wonderful meal.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Amazing meal! Let the chef decide and the staff guide - you will not be disappointed. Added bonus, portions throughout the meal were robust.",5,rpNYC,New York Area
"Terrific, as usual. The tasting menu is the way to go. Our waiter also selected a wonderful bottle of wine for us -- an unexpected treat. We will be back, soon.",5,CafeCentro,New York Area
"Mas is simply my favorite dinning experience in NYC. Mas has great food, outstanding service, a warm decor. It you are out with friends or having a quiet dinner with the one you love, I recommend Mas (farmhouse) over all. I can't wait to go back. LOVE Mas (farmhouse)",5,Orlando,New York Area
food was ok. service was fantastic. food is more important to me.,3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I celebrated my birthday at Mas (farmhouse) last year, but this reservation was for my parents' 40th wedding anniversary. The restaurant was very accomodating in setting up payment and even emailed me a copy of the receipt afterwards. Most importantly, however, my parents had a fabulous time, raved about the food, the service and how special the evening felt. Their dessert even came out with a ""Happy 40th anniversary"" written on it which my parents thought was sweet. My father, who doesn't eat raw fish ever, loved the tuna tartare my mom had ordered -- if a restaurant can pull off such a culinary conversion, you know it's a unique place. I'm getting hungry just thinking about the meal my parents had.",5,NomNominDC,Washington DC
Perfect evening with client had tasting menu - it was amazing !,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Probably a more dressed-up ambiance than you would expect for a restaurant with ""farmhouse"" in the name but the food is absolutely delicious - and I mean delicious in a deliciousness way - and it brings you right back down to earth. Super flexible attitude toward the tasting menu is nice and refreshing. Great French wine list with some tasty well-priced finds. The corn soup with scallop was especially memorable for it's freshness and balance. all that with impeccable service.",5,OpenTable Diner,Denver
Food was excellent and the service was impeccable. The flexibility in the tasting menu options were exemplary. I will definitely be back.,5,OpenTable Diner,Los Angeles
"Fantastic food. We had the 4 course prix fix which they let you customize, and each dish was wonderful. Simple flavors and fresh ingredients, beautfully composed. The room was beautiful with lots of wood and warm tones. The room was quiet despite two groups of 5 and nearly every table full. While the service was wonderful and the waitstaff friendly, we did feel slightly rushed. As soon as we put our forks down they swooped in to take away our plates; slightly more relaxed pacing would have been appreciated.",5,Jgag,San Diego
"As I try to come up with a criticism of Mas, the only thing I can think of is that the font on the wine list is too small. That should tell you how good this restaurant is. The first thing we noticed was the understated elegance of the room. Second, the staff knows and loves food. They are helpful and efficient. Knowledgeable without being intrusive. Third, the food is simply delicious. Highly recommend.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Amazing! Would go back in a heartbeat.,5,FoodieKaz,New York Area
"I will definitely return to this lovely restaurant! I invited a friend who is a food writer to celebrate her birthday. We were given a lovely corner table in the back room. We opted for the 4 course prix fixe menu. The restaurant is extremely flexible with the guests' food choices, as we could mix and match as we liked. The yellowfin tuna appetizer is a winner, as was the heirloom tomato tart. Zucchini blossoms were OK, but the duck was great. The wine list is small; we stayed with wines by the glass because we each found something to our taste on that list. The staff are very nice and very knowledgeable. The atmosphere is friendly, easygoing, borders on casual even though this is a very serious restaurant.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Best food experience i've ever had in nyc!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
The waiters choreographed their service. Two came up each time to serve my spouse and myself Every time. It was so fun and a great birthday treat.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Great meal - we ordered the Chef's six course tasting menu - great service as it was casual but attentive - we loved the fact that they are able to remove the formality of the experience while still serving an excellent meal. Highly recommend going. Can't wait to go back.,5,happyday,Philadelphia
We had the perfect anniversary dinner. Every bite was somehow nuanced and exploding with flavor. Almost every dish on the menu could be prepared gluten free for my wife. The corn and scallop soup was insane.,5,WestVillageEater,New York Area
"Loved the food and service. Tables for 2 are a bit cramped, but still had a romantic feel. Tomatoe tart and corn soup were great. Lobster risotto was also good, but not as tasty as it looked.",5,Hoonynoo,New York Area
"Amazing food, but if you're two people, you'll get a cramped table. And the wine list is super expensive. But, the food is seriously awesome.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Food was outstanding. Four course menu allows you to select which food you want for each course -- very flexible. Dining by courses favors pairing a glass of wine with each course, but the by-the-glass wine list is very limited and not fully matched with the food being offered. With very few bottled wines at less than $100, it makes it difficult to have as good a wine experience as you will a food experience.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"My husband and I had an amazing meal at Mas (farmhouse) this past Friday evening. The host (Alfonzo) was wonderfully attentive; he asked our preference for a table. The service and food were amazing. The staff explained the menu and wine list, they made perfect recommendations. We will absolutely be going back.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
So disappointing!! Terrible food. I had duck and it was completely tasteless!,1,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
"Attentive, pleasant service couldn't overcome the atmospheric problems of tables that are much to close together (the overall noise level isn't high enough to drown out the specifics of your neighbors' conversations). Other than a spectacular scallop and corn soup, dinner was disappointing -- tasteless fish course, rubbery squab. Wine list has limited choices under $100 but the choices are good.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"One of the best meals in New York, ipso facto the U.S. Wine list is notable both for selection and price, broad and high!",5,DineFine,New York Area
Great place. Great food. Great service. Went on the recommendation of a friend and was not disappointed!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Would not return.Although the food was fine enough,there was noting outstanding,with a few excpetions.The corn soup with scallop, was absolutley wonderful.Once we tasted the soup, we thought we were in for a real treat that night.Not the case-soup was the best thing about the meal.I had the tuna oriental,and my husband had rhe lobster risotto.The lobster risotto portion was miniscule and tasteless.The tuna,unmemorable. For dessert:the cheese plate-only one cheese on the plate was fantastic,and the lemon soup, which was good, but not outstanding.For a restuarnt at this price point, we can(and have done) much better in NY.With wine, our meal for 2 was over $300,which we are willing to pay for an outstaning meal-this was not it.",2,parisgirl,New England
Very consistent with a hip vibe,4,TheToothsomePalate,New York Area
"Great food, outstanding service and ambiance, a little gem in West Village. I've been there for a special occasion with my wife and enjoyed a wonderful night. Reservation strongly recommended.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Overpriced and overrated Food is good but not spectacular as the prices they charge The entrance and bar area are very nice but the main room is jammed and quite noisy. The tables along the wall are literally 6 inches apart, and frankly for the price paid they should ensure more privacy and not forcing you to hear all the conversation of the 4 tables next to you.",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Mas was quite simply one of the best restaurants I've ever been to.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Minute portions at very high prices makes for a bad value.  Or, taking it the other way around, at these prices the food was just okay, competent, workman-like. Pretty presentations and interesting pairings of flavors but nothing new, nothing explosive, nothing memorable.  After leaving one month's mortgage payment on the table we joked about heading to Gray's Papaya for dinner and that should not happen.  Desserts were great. Wines were sensational (but expensive).  Overall not enough sizzle or substance, especially for the kind of cash they charge.",2,Deipnosophist,New York Area
"The food at Mas was ""classic"" new American (nearly)locavore cuisine. The poached lobster over nettle risotto was masterful. The quail breast over collards and beans with livers wrapped in collards was delicious albeit the breasts themselves a little tough. There were two problems however: one, the wine list - why is it that the sommelier cannot find any sparkling wine worth serving under $88? $20 to $24 per glass!? The rest of the wine list seemed over-priced as well. Mas needs a more ""nuanced"" wine list with smarter, cheaper choices; and two, the service, we were a couple and waited 12 to 20 minutes between courses. Not good. In addition one server had a booming voice and managed to spend time chatting with a nearby table.",3,ladythatlunches,New York Area
"Blink and you may walk right by Mas (farmhouse). But it's definitely worth finding--Mas is a gem for foodies and those craving neighborhood atmosphere in the big city. The modular four course tasting menu offers myriad dining choices, and between my wife and I, we were able to sample almost everything the kitchen had to offer. Individual portions were suitably small but the dishes packed big flavors. We found the wine selection to be superb, if lacking in affordable options. Sometimes aloof service meant we endured an entire course with empty wine glasses. It boggles the mind. We were ultimately rewarded, however, with several complimentary glasses of bubbly during dessert, a sparkling finale to a mostly wonderful evening.",4,OpenTable Diner,Austin
"We loved everything about our dining experience here. The food was very fresh, perfectly prepared, and the flavors were excellent all-around. Since the menu changes daily, we would love to return. The wines we tried, which were recommended by our waiter, were excellent (the wine list is nearly all of French origin). The service was impeccable - very attentive - no shortage of staff moving efficiently and unobtrusively, and the chef was very flexible and accomodating with the menu choices. We loved the cozy yet somewhat lively atmosphere.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Fabulously fresh meal. Everything was so tasty and the Amuse Bouche given by the chef was amazing! A great place to celebrate an occasion, birthday, graduation, anniversary.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
This is my second time at Mas and it was as good if not better than my first time. We opted for the four course meal plus a wine pairing which was a sublime choice. The sommelier was on top of each course and provided for a  perfect meal for my wife - who was celebrating her birthday!   Thanks again Mas ! Sublime start to finish.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Great atmosphere. Excellent Service. Perfect drinks. Superb food. Amazing desserts. What else is there to say? The best restaurant in New York? Probably.,5,Alice,New York Area

"We were more than pleased to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary at MAS!  Everything was exceptional and delicious, from the ambiance, the hostess, the food and the fresh selections,  the wine, to the entire staff...it was a special occasion and we felt extremely special!  We will surely be back!",5,OpenTable Diner,Washington DC
Dinner was absolutely fantastic - we brought some wine and they paired the courses we ordered with the wines to create an incredible experience.  The short rib entree was one of the most incredible things I've ever eaten.,5,JB16,New York Area
Excellent food. Menu is great because you can make an entrée an appetizer and vice versa.  The service was also great.   A bit pricey but worth it!,5,AngelaO,New York Area
The restaurant was okay not amazing or extraordinary.,3,Wvillage,New York Area

"Fabulous New Year's Eve Dinner, highly recommended. Great food, good service, friendly staff, good wine list. And Amazing Food.",5,OpenTable Diner,Houston
"Been twice - food has been on point each time in every way, and the sommelier has simply knocked it out of the park with his wine pairings and explanations/conversations. We’ll go back as much as we can afford. :-)",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Truly amazing food.  Almost parallel in all of NYC,5,TheKitchenSpy,New York Area
Yellow fin tuna appetizer was a perfect opener. Half portion of lobster and short ribs was a creative update on surf and turf. Service was friendly and personable. A wonderful experience.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"We took my daughter and her boyfriend here for her 21st birthday dinner. We had the smaller of the tasting menus. All was lovely, food, service, ambiance, etc. All the courses were fine, and the wine list was also very nice (including numerous affordable French wines). While it was not cheap (our prix-fix was in the $80's) it was quite a nice value and compares very well to other top places. We had not been back since it reopened after the fire; it is back and running like its old self.",5,nathbeck,New York Area
One of the most lovely restaurants in Manhattan.  Terrific food in a gorgeous setting with professional and friendly waitstaff.  Wine list is creative as the restaurant tries very hard to offer interesting choices.  This should be on everyone's must try list!!,5,Nyer,New York Area
They are amazing and so friendly and accomadating! They treat vegans and vegetarians with the same respect as regular diners and it shows in the food!,5,OpenTable Diner,Washington DC
"Always  spectacular, you will dig deep, but worth it. Have been a couple times and will return again",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I have intended on eating at Mas for sometime because I knew it took pride in its use of farm fresh ingredients. Although I found the food good I think that there are so many better options available to the New York diner. The setting is rather unremarkable and the service is mediocre. The menu is diverse and certainly not extensive. This is not necessarily a criticism but in other restaurants I could make the same observation about, the selections I actually was excited about were few and far between. I can’t really say anything “bad” but I can’t honestly recommend Mas to a fellow diner. I feel the dollars spent here could be put to better use at so many other restaurants.",3,enjoygoodfood,Los Angeles
We had a family holiday dinner at Mas Farmhouse and it was superb from start to finish.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I love this restaurant - amazing food, great wine pairings, and spectacular service. Mas  farmhouse never disappoints. I highly recommend it for a special occasion.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I have always loved this restaurant and my most recent visit was no exception.  My date was a vegan and she loved the chefs creation as much as I did, and the wine pairing was excellent.",5,JKingH,New York Area
Very cozy little West Village spot that offers 4 or 7 course tasting menu. Meal was very tasty and the service was excellent. Outstanding wine list heavy on French selections.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
One of New York's great restaurants and great for a special birthday celebration.,4,Davey,New York Area
"Great experience Worth going threre, a must in NY",5,natanl,New England
"The food was better than I expected. I had the 6 course chef's selection menu... Everything thing that the chef chose for me was delicious, not a good menu for you if you are picky about what you eat. I also tried the lobster and the tuna occidental (I was not alone), and both plates were very tasty....",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
We echo every good review. One of the best dining experiences we've had in the city in a long time. A culinary tour de force with impeccable service.,5,OpenTable Diner,Las Vegas
"Hands down best NY restaurant experience my wife and I have ever enjoyed. From the perfect mojito at the bar, to the fun and hip staff, to the most amazing culinary delight my taste buds could ever hope to savor. This place is a total winner. Did I mention the decor? Cozy, warm, intimate. Zero attitude. Just all about serving you the best meal you've ever had. Go there now.",5,Deidz60,New York Area
"We had a very good time at Mas. The food wasn't as exceptional as I had hoped, but it was very good.",4,OpenTable Diner,Washington DC
One of the best restaurants in which I've ever eaten. Definitely best NY meal we had during our 4 day visit. Would go back in a heartbeat and recommend to all friends.,5,OpenTable Diner,Los Angeles
Just a fantastic restaurant. Terrific food and service. The decor is beautifully done.,5,Villagefoodie,New York Area

Excellent from all aspects - can't wait to try again,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

a bit expensive but great for a special occasion,5,Angela,Los Angeles
A very pleasant surprise for a neighborhood place. Hidden gem that has been there for years. Enjoyable on every level.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Food and service was great. Wish I had the time for the six course where the chef does his own thing dependent upon your likes or dislikes.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
When our trusted friends told us they had the best meal in years at Mas Farmhouse we knew we had to go but didn't know what to expect and that may be the most magical part of the experience at Mas farmhouse. I believe that no to meals will ever be the same as the chef and staff are willing to do back flips to customize a meal experience to suit the mood you are currently in. We were told that if we couldn't decide our order due to everything looking so amazing we would have a half order of two entrees in order to allow us to try more of the enticing menu. The quality of the food and talent in the kitchen and front of house are spectacular and I am looking forward to my next trip to Mas farmhouse.,5,OpenTable Diner,Los Angeles
Excellent meal. The best I've ever eaten!,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"BEST cocktail I have ever had - the grapefruit and vodka one. Great food, the tasting menu took 3 hours which felt a bit too long, I still love this place though and would definitely go back.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Lovely restaurant and innovative food but a bit pretentious and expensive ...woman at neighboring table working on two smart phones at one time most distracting -,4,cjr2,New York Area
"A must go. Intimate feel with top notch service, inventive food and creative drinks/wine.",5,OpenTable Diner,Philadelphia
the 4 course tasting menu was very well balanced and efficiently delivered to the table. However a great dining experience isn't solely around the food and unfortunately laying out tables 4-6 inches apart doesn't do much for the ambience of what was supposed to be a romantic evening. almost felt like walking straight out when we saw the row of 6 tables for 2 jammed against the wall - real disappointment.,2,OpenTable Diner,Dorset
"Went on a Saturday night with a friend from out of town and we both loved it. We went with the 4 course menu and each of the courses was amazing, fresh, perfectly prepared, delicious. Service was excellent - the right balance of information and attention without being annoying. Highly recommend it.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
I had high expectations after going to Mas grillade and unfortunately it did not compare. The experience at Mas grillade was much much better. The wait staff was pretenscious and made you feel uncomfortable. The food was average at best. The nice thing was that there was flexibility in the four course tasting menu. I can't say that any item I ate was memorable.,3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I went with a friend and thought it was too ""romantic."" Definitely best suited for a date or special occasion. Food was excellent though.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
we selected MAS for our 2nd anniversary and it is always great.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"My wife and I enjoyed our meal very much. The service was professional, friendly and accommodating. The food was excellent with nice presentation and a creative flair. The atmosphere was inviting with a ""smart casual"" tone (understated Indie rock on the audio system, attentive and friendly wait staff). The space itself struck the farmhouse chord that they are aiming for. My only negative comment is I left ready to eat more.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Fantastic food and coctails. Excellent service. This place is now one of our all time favorites.,5,triburbian,New York Area
"The menu was innovative and interesting. The food was delicious. The wait staff were friendly, but so very slow. Waited over 45 minutes for our appetizers, even longer for entrees. What made it worse was the anemic air conditioning that was provided to the diners. Not one of our party was not sweating by the end of the meal.",4,EatURHeartOUT,New York Area
Food was excellent. But the service was even better. The waiter and other staff paid attention to all the details to make sure everyone had a good time.,5,Cuquet,New York Area
"*Really* amazing food. They'll let you assemble your own three or six course tasting menu from the rest of the menu, and everything is lovely. I had sort of a decomposed salad of quail eggs, green beans, and summer snap peas, which was amazingly good and fresh, and then a great tuna dish, and really yummy chicken. Highly highly recommend.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"One of the most delightful dining experiences I've had in a while...farm to table concept actually works with very attentive but not overbearing service. The tuna appetizer was divine as was the pea soup. The duck dish I had was properly cooked and well seasoned. Overall, I am extremely impressed",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Good but pricey.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
From the amuse through dessert the tasting menu was a delicious dining experience. Wonderful wine pairings served by a knowledgeable and efficient staff made for a great evening.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"First time here, and it was great. Get your reservation for the front room, not the back as the back doesn't have very much character.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Extraordinarily good chef. One of the best restaurants I've visited in NYC.,5,RetiredGuy,New York Area
"Food was pretty good, but the tight tables and excessive noise were a bit overbearing for us.  Wouldn't go out of my way to go back.",3,Captain,Miami
"This is a real foodies' restaurant. Delicious and special food. But I found some of the dishes were better than others. The wine was excellent. The service was impeccable, but the meal is paced rather slowly - you need to plan 3 hours for your meal. A great find for foodies and special occasions. And everything is local and organic and seasonal. We recommend it.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Great tasting menu which is custom built around your particular dietary restrictions.,5,JohnB,New York Area
"Very good and original food, very good and friendly service, limited but original selection of wines by the glass, very nice experience!",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Went there for a mutual anniversary celebration with another couple. Just a great place. We had a very capable knowledgeable and entertaining waiter. The menu was so original and wide open. We all had the 4 course per- fixe dinner selected from anywhere on the menu. All delicious and bright with flavor. Only down side was a boisterous table of 10. The staff did as much as they could to keep them in check.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Excellent place!  Loved our entire experience.Food was great, service was exceptional with wait staff on top of every detail, without making you feel rushed or pressured.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Food was excellent, most notably the sea scallop starter and squab and sausage entrees. They also have good wines by the glass, especially their rose champagne and the Sonoma valley Pinot noir, for those wanting a little variety with their meal. Service was polished and friendly without being overly solicitous. When my wife, who has an aversion to dairy, wasn't able to finish her starter they were very quick to notice and were able to make up a substitute which she thoroughly enjoyed. The space is cozy and warm with a nice farmhouse-table setting in the centre which is great for groups.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I took my wife to this restaurant for her birthday, as she loves the farmer's table concept, and it was one of the finest dining experiences we have ever had!  I would absolutely recommend this restaurant to anyone and would visit again.  Very high quality and knowledgeable staff without being pretentious.  Highly recommend the tasting menu for the true Mas experience!",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Fabulous, fresh and inventive for such basic foods. Wonderful meal. Thank you.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"A really terrific gem of a restaurant tucked away on a quiet street. Love that you can customize your own four course menu. The service was flawless and unpretentious. Food was also obviously sensational. I had the roasted scallop in corn soup, yellow fin tuna l'occidental, poached lobster with nettle risotto, and the squab. Everything was wonderful but make sure you get the tuna. It is one of the best dishes I have ever put into my mouth.",5,gvcalda,New York Area
"The only word to describe Mas Farmhouse...WOW! The food was incredible and the service was some of the best I've had. It is a tiny place, so the only negative was that the tables were so close together, you felt as if you were dining with strangers. We ate early, so we set until dessert. Overall, LOVED IT!",5,OpenTable Diner,Miami
We did the tasting menu. It was amazing. We loved that you could really choose from anything on the menu vs restaurants that want you to order only specific items or the chef decides and you aren't sure what you get. The chef and kitchen were really accommodating. Everything we ate was really delicious. Service was superb.,5,DCDining,Washington DC
"The food at Mas was fantastic. We've eaten at a lot of great restaurants but were very impressed with the flavors and presentation of every dish, from the amuse-bouche through dessert. Service was attentive and helpful.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The food was great, and the waitstaff lovely, but the service was sooooo slooooow (and the music awful). It took forever even to order, let alone to get our courses. Again, the food was incredible, but I won't go back. I would recommend Mas Grillade over Mas Farmhouse.",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"This was my first trip to Mas farmhouse and I will definitely be back. The decor was woody and ecletic, very fitting of a farmhouse. The menu was unusual and our meals fantastic. They had no problem with us sharing an entree. Only drawback is its tiny bar, but they sent us to a wine bar across the street to wait and even came and got us when our table was ready. That kind of service seemed unusual in NYC.",5,ShoeFiend,Cleveland
"We live in the heart of the West Village food scene around Abingdon Square and enjoy our local Hot Spots as well as our delicious neighborhood restaurants. We had a friend in town so decided to walk over to the ""South-central"" village and try Mas as we had read some great reviews. We had to take a relatively late reservation because they were booked, and it seemed like it took forever to get water and drinks and then food. Our service was very slow, with the feeling of being staged and posing, having enough servers to distribute the plates at the same second (perhaps rounding up the servers was what took so long!). The food was good but really not that much if any better than any of the MUCH less expensive choices in our neighborhood.",2,OpenTable Diner,New Orleans
"In my view, one of the best restaurants in New York. The food is amazing with service to match. The unigue tasting menu allows every one at the table to eat exactly what they like and there is extraordinary sensitivity to special dietary needs and restrictions.",5,mcon,New York Area
"This is a truly unique restaurant. How many restaurants make their own tonic for a gin and tonic! The waiter suggested a wine that was a little less expensive than the one we were looking at and it was great. My salmon was wonderful, with grilled leeks! It was a beautiful deep orange color which one rarely sees.",4,Blockhead,New York Area

"Been here numerous times. Good food and attentive service are the reasons to go here. Well run front room. Wine list is expensive even by NY standards, but has a number of small lots from experienced producers. Other than a mix up on the starter cocktail, everything was excellently!",4,NowTOURISTS,New York Area
Food was luke warm and there were bones in the fish.,3,OpenTable Diner,New England
"We've been to Mas (farmhouse) several times, had lamented what had seemed like a permanent closing, and rejoiced when it re-opened. The food is spectacularly, but elegantly, wonderful, always a beautiful blend of flavors, colors and textures, served with impeccable timing. Wines are excellent, and wine pairings suggested by the sommelier always interesting. In addition, it's very reasonably priced, given the very high quality of the dining experience. My favorite restaurant in New York, one of my favorites of all time",5,Francesca,New York Area
"We found the whole experience intelligently and sensitively executed. I will come back at the next opportunity! The food is sophisticated and the service is the smartest in the city. Not overbearing, always anticipating what you might ask for, while remaining authentic/casual- the staff is not stiff and contrived but truly genuine. It made for a very relaxed atmosphere and through the whole night we felt we were being watched over , cared for. Highly recommend!",5,MWest,New York Area
"Absolutely perfect dining experience. The food is delicious without being overdone in terms of trying to find something too creative or too sophisticated. The food was incredibly flavorful and service was attentive. It's pricey, but worth it. The only part I would have skipped was the bottle of wine since they don't have many mid-tier options and the bottle was not exactly what I had wanted.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Amazing! The food was sensational (particularly the pork). Wonderful service,5,LEllen,New York Area

"Pricey but excellent food, ambience, and service. The desserts are extraordinary.",5,GabrielaN,New England
Sad to say the food was so salty! My partner sent his food back and I kept mine but both were overly salty.   Such a nice place it's a shame the food doesn't match the ambience. The yellow tail appetizer  however was insanely delicious   Was so looking forward to this neighborhood gem re- opening.  We live down the street and I wanted this to be more of a go to spot for us.  Second  time there and sadly won't go back .,3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Most elegant tasting menu in NYC. Incredible food and service.,5,CFS729,New York Area
Dinner was absolutely incredible.  Did 4 course tasting and every dish was a hit.  Tuna l’occidental is still my absolute favorite.  Kudos to chef Galen and the restaurant for an incredible experience.,5,JB16,New York Area
An otherwise nice meal was well spoiled by a VERY loud party which did not refrain from profanity.  When other guests complained they were called fascists and received no support from the restaurant staff.,2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Half empty on Sunday night. A party of 8 at the prominent family table.  Loud.  Really loud. As if they were in their own home.  No regard for the other two tables.  And not one word was said to them about ruining the meals of others.  So we had to confront them in a mild manner. Sure, 8 raucous people will bring in more money than 3 quiet people that night, but in the long run...",1,GourmetGigi,New York Area
Excellent services! Cozy dining room! Each dish is presented at its best! Super Yummy!  Will definitely go there again and again!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Outstanding all around. Wonderful food. Great, attentive and comfortable service and a modern yet warm ambiance.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"We came to the city to celebrate our tenth anniversary. I good friend recommended Mas (farmhouse) as we wanted something more intimate and personal than one of the big-name fancy places that came to mind first. We were not disappointed. The menu is clever-any item can be ordered a la carte or chosen as a course for the prix fixe dinner. We opted instead for the 6 course chef's tasting menu and left it in his capable hands. The food was fantastic, and I found myself eating(and enjoying) things I never would have ordered on my own. The service was impeccable, attentive but not overbearing. They made us feel completely at home and made our special night memorable.",5,OpenTable Diner,Washington DC
"Mas might be NY best kept secret. Food is always superb. Attentive and discreet service. Short but very nice wine list offering wide price range, and unlike lot of other restaurants lower price bottles are really good wine too. I often dine there with guests suffering from various allergies and the Chef is very mindful of this issue and happy to modify recipe without making a fuzz. They're also flexible in making smaller portions of main dishes so you can in a way make your own tasting menu. As you can tell I love the place and I always make sure I visit on each of my visit in New York. Would highly recommend for up to 4 persons, it's not really suited for larger parties.",5,Cityslang,Berlin
Very noisy and small - albeit delicious - portions.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Mas did not live up to my expectations which were based on past experience.The appetizer was excellent. The main course, however, was bland.The restaurant used to possess a quiet dignity. This time it was noisy, with groups of people seemingly unaware that the restaurant is not their private dining room.",1,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The decor of the restaurant is warm and very inviting. We sat in the back room which was intimate and quiet allowing for an intimate conversation. The service was impeccable, friendly without being intrusive. It was my second time at the restaurant and my dining companion's first and we both found the food to be incredible. We will DEFINITELY be back.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

I had my 60th there last night. The wait staff was warm and attentive. The food was incredible. The whole experienc could not have been better,5,michele,New York Area
"Did the tasting menu. Everything was good with 2 exceptions. The goat cheese ravioli was swimming in beet juice, which kind of overwhelmed the dish. The rack of lamb had the most fat on it I have ever seen in this dish. By the time I cut that away, not much left to eat. The drink (vodka grapefruit martini) was perfect. The lobster salad and tuna apps were the best part of the meal. The waiter was not very attentive, but polite. He never checked if we liked any of the food, other than once, right after the appetizers. Overall, good, but not worth the money, in my opinion.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Food and service were wonderful. Unfortunately, the tables are so close together, it's very difficult to have a private conversation, or to tune out the conversations of neighboring tables. It actually put a real damper on the overall experience.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Our experience at Mas was nice, but didn't exactly compare to the rave reviews that we'd heard from other people. The overall ambiance was nice, the food was tasty and the service was attentive. There were a few cons though - first, the ""grade pending"" sign in the window didn't exactly inspire confidence for such a high-end restaurant. Then, we felt pressured by the waiter to order a much more expensive bottle of wine than what we'd selected. ""No"" didn't seem to be an option which we didn't really appreciate. Then, my card was charged for a full amount even though I brought (and gave) them a gift-card. Not a big deal as it was easily remedied, but this certainly wasn't the care-free, luxury dining experience that I was expecting it to be.",3,katha1,New York Area
"absolutely marvelous. An evening to remember. The food was only matched by the attentive and knowledgeable staff. In short, we were very impressed and will be returning very soon.",5,CafeCentro,New York Area
Sublime dining experience. Exquisite food and service.,5,Buck2000,New York Area
"Unobtrusive place on quiet West Village street features provencal-inflected dishes with emphasis on seafood. Limited but interesting menu. Food was good to excellent. Duck and halibut main courses both worth trying. Portions are modest. Staff is friendly and engaging although service is less than professional (glasses go unfilled, bread plates left empty). Wine list is very eclectic and interesting but very much overpriced. Atmosphere is comfortable, with attractive decor, soft lighting (a little too dim), and background hum that permits easy conversation. All told we preferred the food at mas (la grillade), their sister restaurant, but preferred the atmosphere at mas (farmhouse). Both are worth trying.",3,VillageDiner,New York Area
"For our anniversary dinner, it was perfect.",5,bcny,New York Area
At Mas (farmhouse) The food was 'super' - bread 'out of this world'. Great dining experience. Only negative was that the 'tables for two' along the wall were too close together making conversation difficult.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
wine and food just ok 2 servers coming at once was nice decor/ambiance/noise level great,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Excellent food and atmosphere. Portion size rather small.,4,OpenTable Diner,Philadelphia
Outstanding service and excellent food!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"This is a couples spot for that special occasion. The food is creative, yet good - but not the best in NYC by any means. Atmosphere is serene, the service well timed. Menu changes frequently, but have the tuna tartare appetizer (it's large and has amazing taste), avoid the chicken for a main course; in season have soft shell crabs. Desserts were just ok (and very expensive). Do not have the carrot cake or the sour cherries, but if you must have the hazelnut chocolate dessert.  One note, since Open Table only has the non-choice reservation times available (6pm or after 9pm), we took the later res. We were the last to leave the restaurant and as we left and were thanking the staff they said, ""GET OUT!"" which was so tacky after spending $500",3,thepamrusso,New York Area

"Mas Farmhouse is always satisfying - food, service, &amp; ambience. A dependable pleasure.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"First time at this restaurant. The service and ambience were great but the food wasn't anything special. They definitely try hard here but I wouldn't rush back. I ordered a salad that was great but very skimpy. For $17, you would think they could give you more than a few pieces of lettuce. That aside - I felt like everything was very salty and somewhat tasteless. Dessert was ok - nothing special. One thing that bothered us was that they were spraying windex in the restaurant while we were still eating. It definitely put a bad taste in my mouth. Cute spot though - and the bar area seemed like a nice place to meet for a drink.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Too pricey for the food - much better alternatives in the city,2,MFNYC,New York Area
"This is my absolute favorite restaurant in the city. The food is second to none, but unburdened by a stuffy atmosphere or uptight chef/waitstaff. The vibe is more relaxed than most restaurants of its caliber and the service is attentive and friendly. They make a point of noting--again, in contrast to too many restaurants these days--that they are more than happy to alter the menu items to meet food likes/dislikes. My only complaint is that it is so hard to get a reservation these days!",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"We were actually a little disappointed bc our expectations were very high. It is a very good restaurant, but i would not put it in the same category as nyc's top.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Had higher expectations after reading other reviews. Difficult to have a conversation due to noise level. Took 10-15 minutes to be acknowledged by wait staff. Food was pretty good - not spectacular. Nice idea/marketing(farm to table etc) and feel of the restaurant was nice. They might have been off that night, but they just didn't deliver.",3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Everything about this restaurant was excellent.  The ambiance is very romantic, the food spectacular, and the service impeccable!!  I would highly recommend Mas Farmhouse!",5,IUmom6,New York Area
"It is insulting to pay, what I think it a goodly sum, for a thimble fill of food. While the cuisine was tasty and fresh, the portions were so tiny, we had to fill ourselves up with bread so as not to leave hungry. Having said that, the service was quite good. In addition, the acoustics were so bad, we couldn't hear ourselves talking.",2,gegandco,New York Area
Food was amazing but noise level was a little high. Cannot wait to return!,5,Foodie,Houston
Truly excellent eating experience - probably within the top 3 in our 42 years of frequent restaurant eating. Highly recommended.,5,OpenTable Diner,Montreal
if you are booking a reservation for a quiet evening make sure to ask for the back room. We were sat in the front and had a ridiculously loud party next to us - since the tables are very close - this was a problem. The staff was very nice and moved us but not far enough. There was nothing left in the back. Food was delicious.,4,Sharon,New York Area
"Service was great and ambience was nice, but the food was inconsistent. For example, the lobster salad appetizer was delightful, but the soft shell crab entree was so over seasoned with bacon and salt that you couldn't taste the crab. It was a nice meal because of the great service, but we definitely expected more from the food at this price point.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
fantastic place..we didn't order..we told our fabulous waiter what we like and he took care of it,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Very knowledgable and friendly servers. They also moved in a swarm, such that all (six) diners' plates were placed on the table within 3 seconds of one another. Tremendous food, but not enough and too expensive. Ambience was dark, quiet, and lovely. A little too aggressive with the water filling. The waiters must be evaluated on how quickly they can fill the glasses because even when I asked them to stop, they continued refilling.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The service and decor were lovely. The cocktail was delicious.  But, the food was unbearable salty. The salad with buttermilk dressing was loaded with salt, topped with bacon. The soft-shell crabs tasted like they'd been caught in the Dead Sea. My companion's dinner was equally oversalted. The chef needs to lighten his/her hand.",3,slmd7,London
"Had the tasting menu with my mom during mother's day, it was so worth it!  Pretty expensive but definitely worth it!",5,jess,New York Area
"Fantastic food, with amazing service, in a warm and inviting setting",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

Always great!  This visit didn't disappoint!  Flavor combinations are phenomenal,5,Artnpen,Tallahassee
Great food and great service.  Loved the bar also.  Will eat here again soon.,5,doodlebat,Tallahassee
"We ordered every appetizer on the menu (except the duck) to share and a few of the salads. Everything was amazing, including the focaccia and olive oil. If I go back to Destin, I would definitely go back.",5,TaraC,New England
We had a fabulous brunch with endless mimosas. The chef surprised us with a tasting of the most delicious lemon ricotta pancakes with blueberries and Basil. I am salivating while I'm writing this. Such a delightful treat.,5,ChanelsMom42,Nashville
"Mostly delicious! Duck confit appetizer delicious; butter lettuce wedge with bleu cheese delicious; entrées, rack of lamb, delicious, and almond crusted grouper, could have been better- under seasoned and overcooked. The grouper was unfortunate because everything else was great! Will give it another try next time we are in town!",4,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
Wonderful food! Expensive but worth it.I would highly recommend it.,4,JoBob,Western NC
Great food all around.  The chefs are amazing.  Our server was exceptional.  This was a great find for us while on vacation.  If I could change anything it would be the atmosphere.,5,OpenTable Diner,Columbus
The food was outstanding and the service was exactly what you would desire from a fine dining restaurant. I look forwar to going to it again when we are in the area.,5,OpenTable Diner,Orlando
"Jeanie was superior. She treated my children like adults with respect and they loved it. Food was amazing. I had the scallops with fennel salad and black rice, my daughter who doesn't like seafood had the chicken and she said it was really juicy. My son had the filet and gave it 9 out of 10 stars and we are from the Midwest and eat a lot of great steaks. I had the cheesecake, my son had the vanilla ice cream and my daughter had the pastry chef's family recipe of pineapple cobbler with coconut ice cream. She said it was amazing! We are here for vacation and might be back again this week!",5,IRunToEatAndDrink,Kansas City
"Every course was great . Beautiful presentation and delicious food. Waitress- Becky ? Betsy? Was wonderful.  Only issue was attitude of hostess when we didn't want table she tried to seat us at.... really minor compared to a delightful, albeit, expensive dinner....",4,OpenTable Diner,Jacksonville
Delicious!,5,Anniedun,Nashville

Great food. Casual Fine dining and we are locals to the area!! Best steak around!,5,KBell,Tallahassee
The highlight of our trip!  Wonderful handcrafted cocktails and an excellent wine list.  Our seafood and steaks were amazing and the Lobster Spring Roll appetizer is a must try for every diner.  Michael made our evening special and pleasant!  Will definitely visit again!,5,OpenTable Diner,Charleston
All around an excellent experience. The ambiance was modern and upscale. The service was excellent and the food was wonderful.,5,BryanG,Tallahassee
This place was so awesome. It was classy yet comfortable. I saw some nice dresses and suits but also saw nice comfy shirts and blouses (me being one!). The food was wonderful! I ordered the soup of the day and it marvelous!! But definitely not enough lol! I will certainly be returning if when I come to Florida again.,4,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
Outstanding service and food!,5,Ace1,New Orleans

Outstanding meal. Worth the $$$.,5,cbm29,Atlanta
Lobster spring rolls were phenomenal!!,5,Trini,Atlanta
"Having been before and having a very impressive experience, I was disappointed with this Valentine's dinner.  We weren't seated until 45 minutes past our reservation time.  When seated the hostess insisted on taking my wife to the table alone rather than wait so I could close out the bar bill.  When our entrees were delivered to the table mine was room temperature.  It took a while to get our waitresses attention, but when I said my dish was not warm, she told me the chef evidently preferred serving it that way.  It took some urging on my part before she would take it back to heated more.  Overall the service atmosphere was very business-like, but not warm and welcoming.",3,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Valentines for a steak dinner, the starters where amazing . I could of just ate those over and over. My filet was good . Nothing special. Not very cozy and intimate. I would return for a dinner out , but not a special occasion",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
Table was as requested through Open Table and we were immediately seated. Service was very good and food was outstanding. Although somewhat pricey it was actually worth it as the food was exceptional.,5,eddi,Chicago
Food was excellent and our waiter was very attentive. Michael was well verse &amp; knowable.,4,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
Great cocktail list.superb service and the food is consistently superb! And save room for the bread pudding for desert.Oh..and excellent wine list for those of you that preded wine.,5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
A truly lovely dinner with exceptional food and wine. Great bar food options and elegant choices in the dining room.,5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"Very nice dinner, but quite ""buttery"" and not cheap. Worth the $$ for a real nice evening out.  Great place for a cocktail and two appetizers... then price-wise and quality-wise a good deal. Very nice upgraded dining.",4,KAP73,Tallahassee
"Excellent Food, service and ambiance. Great place for business dinner.",5,Stewart,Dallas
"Nice evening..great service, great food, pleasant atmosphere.  Highly recommend!",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"Found this establishment on Google as fine dining in Destin and decided to take my girlfriend here for our 2 year anniversary. The atmosphere and drinks were excellent but everything else was mediocre. None of the employees looked at or addressed my girlfriend through the entire dining experience, only speaking to me. Even when her drink was empty only I was offered another one. She ordered her filet cooked medium. It came out Very Very rare, still cold in the center. It was still borderline medium rare/rare after we sent it back.  Once her food finally came out again and mine was cold but as soon as we started eating we noticed Her 41$ filet came with instant mashed potatoes. To top it off, every time the server came by to check on us she would rub my upper back for literally no reason.",2,Seth,Tallahassee
Great seafood and absolutely loved the fish cakes!,4,OpenTable Diner,Orlando
"Happy hour is good.  Bar is small but nice.  Get there early, a popular location for locals.  Dining room is nice, a bit too formal an ambiance and not very cozy (I loved their old restaurant location ambiance, and this is totally different), but that's kind of picky and I suspect a lot of people would prefer this...  Service is fantastic.  Servers have been there for a long time and very attentive,  but not too attentive.  Nice selection of entrees and apps.",5,anon,Denver
"My favorite restaurant in Miramar Beach!  Everything is prepared well, visually please and delicious.  The staff if accommodating and professional.  The best entree' is the chicken:  Very moist and flavorful!",5,OpenTable Diner,New Orleans

The best meal we had while in Destin!! The steaks and salads Are wonderful!!,5,travelswell,Key West
Was very expensive and the food for the set menu was just ok. But I do love this restaurant. Will be back....just not on a holiday.,4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Wonderful, as always!  The service, the food and beverages, and the ambience were excellent!",5,OpenTable Diner,Memphis
Hostess was incredibly rude  Table was set for 5 people when reservation was for 6 8:00 reservation and entrees did not come out until 9:45 and we only ordered appetizers for the table. Wonderful food and waitress was great. Management and front of the house need improvement.,2,OpenTable Diner,New Orleans
"I have dined here twice in the past two months. I really love this restaurant and I hope it succeeds. First, so grateful for an establishment that takes reservations! The service has been outstanding both times. The Godfather martini is a great way to start....the bread and (one time, special pineapple) butter whipped up on site are very nice.  I've had fresh fish entree and the popular steak - both were really good. Wine list is better than adequate - I would like to see some more interesting wines offered. I hate seeing the ""usual suspects"" on the wine list - always appreciate an opportunity to discover a new wine while enjoying a meal. Don't get me wrong: the list includes some good, not so run of the mill wines - I'd just like to see more. Prices are  par for the area - several entrees in 40+ range, so it's not cheap (but it is most worth it). So nice to show up at a designated time, don't have to valet (or search for a parking space), ATTENTIVE staff, great cocktails and really good food. Almost hate to say too much because I don't want to have to compete for a table!",5,OpenTable Diner,Birmingham
"What a disappointment! Based on other positive review, I booked a table for dinner.  After the order was placed and wine was served, I did not see anybody for 20 minutes.  I sat there just with a glass of wine.  The server said she would bring a basket of bread but that basket did not arrive at least 30 minutes.  Then arugula salad came, drenched in dressing, unable to taste anything else but vineger.  The server was still nowhere to be found.  Another 30 minutes passed with no service.  Then, the main dish, overcooked, too salty fish.  They claimed to prepare their food from scratch but what I received did not taste anything special.  I did not receive any service and the food was mediocre at best.",1,diner,Vancouver
Bijoux is one of the best restaurants in Miramar Beach.  Service staff is great and the food is always delicious and presented nicely.   It is regularly on our list for a special meal.,5,JohnV,Little Rock
"Excellent service and great food. Choices of wine by the glass are limited and the variety of red wine is a bit low but there are enough options to satisfy most.   The cowboy ribeye is a great choice as is the shrimp and grits. Every dish is well portioned so that you can start with an appetizer, have a salad or soup, entree, and dessert.   The food was great, but the service was excellent. The wait staff made you feel like you were at home and were happy to work with any request you had.",5,BlazinKY,Cincinnati
Service was great.  Food was good but not great.  The presentation is very nice but we thought everything was overpriced for what you were served.,4,AlV1224,Dallas
Food was excellent. Service was a bit overbearing. Made us feel rushed which detracts fro the romantic experience.,3,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Meal was very good. Our table probably made it louder for others.  Very enjoyable.  Will return!,5,Pwmo,Tallahassee
"We went for Mother's Day, and were seated right when we arrived. The appetizers were superb, the service was top notch, and the the wine selection was extensive. I've had better food for the price, but adjusting for the location it's not unreasonable.",5,OpenTable Diner,Birmingham
Great food and owners were hands on.  My kids loved the outdoor area.,5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee

"We celebrated our 12 year Anniversary, and we had an amazing experience. Our server was so friendly and attentive. The food was out of this world delicious! Great atmosphere, and the drinks were tasty. Loved it!",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"We enjoyed a delicious dinner here.  My husband and I had gumbo as a starter.  It was a special soup for the night.  It was as good as some of the best restaurants in New Orleans.  For dinner, my husband had the filet, and he said it was very good.  I had the roasted chicken, and it was delicious.  We also both enjoyed the sides that accompanied the entrees.  Sautéed kale, seasoned mashed potatoes with the steak.  With the chicken, I had polenta, brussel sprouts, and broccolini.  Very well seasoned and prepared.  We shared a wonderful cheesecake for dessert.  All of the desserts are prepared in house.  They also serve a delicious bread basket with the dinners.  The noise level was a little more than we like, but it was a busy night for them.  I would suggest making reservations because it is a popular place!",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"Delicious food, attentive ,knowledgeable ,and accommodating service. Fine dining( menu, and priced accordingly) and we will most certainly recommend and return. My husband had the chicken from the menu, I had the fish special , and we shared the bread pudding for dessert. Every bite was wonderful, including our leftovers which we enjoyed the following day.",5,Jhilti,Memphis
This place is beautiful. We sat at the bar and William was fantastic. We had the shrimp and grits as well as the lobster spring rolls.  Food and drinks were the best we've had in Destin. We can't wait to go back.,5,OpenTable Diner,New Orleans
"excellent food, sizeable portions and great selections",5,steveb,Birmingham
Super cuisine and service.We happened upon a before 6pm half off one entree so was exceptional value.,4,Verde,Washington DC
"Excellent food! Dined here several times.  Love the Oyster salad! If you like fried oysters, must try. I usually have it for my meal- it's a lot. Our last visit took a long time to get our drinks &amp; food. We wanted desert but didn't order due to the delay in getting of meal. It wasn't our waitress fault. She apologized for delay- maybe they did not have enough help that night. Will definitely dine here again.",4,goodfoodfinder,Atlanta
Bijoux is a true gem to have in San Destin. The relaxing atmosphere and great food make it the perfect place to retreat after a day at the beach.,5,Falk,New Orleans
Despite advising the restaurant that we were celebrating our 30th anniversary nothing was mentioned or done to acknowledge the special occasion. That being said our food came out on schedule and was very good. We chose the the tuna carpaccio for the appetizer and it was delicious. I had the grouper and my husband had the airline chicken. Both were very good and nice sized portions. We did not order dessert,4,FoodE,Atlanta
Outstanding food!  Wonderful atmosphere. Staff very friendly and attentive. Highly recommend for someone who really appreciates fine food and dining.,5,OpenTable Diner,Louisville

"I come and visit the Destin area every few months and was looking for a fine dining restaurant for a nice date. The Bijoux nailed it. Very courteous despite being 30 minutes late to my reservation (due to traffic) as well. Fantastic food, and great place to chat. Business casual or just a nice polo for guys and ladies can look their best! Great time",5,James,Tallahassee

My favorite restaurant on the Emerald Coast by far!!!,5,Foodie,Orange County
"The food, service and ambiance were wonderful.  We went for brunch and everything we ordered was beautifully displayed, and tasted good. My husband said best shrimp and grits he has ever had - the dish is served with andouille sausage and gravy.  The avocado toast is another thing you've got to have if you go.  We were blown away by this restaurant - the service was pure southern hospitality. Can't wait to go back.",5,OpenTable Diner,Minneapolis
Had a very enjoyable meal here with a group of friends. Service was a little slow but all meals arrived at same time for a large(ish) group. Food was all excellent and there is a good wine list. Ambience is very pleasant.,4,helwise,New York Area

Food and service were fabulous. Can’t wait to return,5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
The food was very slow we never saw a manager the steak was cooked well but it was about the size of a sausage patty the vegetables were not good at all and every thing was overpricedi'm not sure where this restaurant got its original rating but I would avoid it I found nothing good about it except for the attitude of the bartenders they were nice,1,Doug,Atlanta

"Awesome food! We are from Nee Orleans so it is hard to impress and Bijoux did just that tonight.   Everything from appetizer, salad, entrees were all great!",5,OpenTable Diner,New Orleans
Good food. Good atmosphere. Good service. Good restaurant. Just good. I’d go back. It has potential to be great. No music playing in dining room. Not sure how I feel about that. It was nice not to have to speak over it. But I realize it helps drown out the conversations of other guests.,4,GeoffH,New Orleans
The meal was fabulous and our service could not have been better. When I asked for a particular type of wine she went to the back to search for it and returned with an excellent substitute. She never rushed us but was always attentive and polite. It was a delightful evening.,5,OpenTable Diner,Mississippi
"Our first visit to Bijoux was terrific. The restaurant was quiet, our server was very knowledgeable and attentive, and the food was terrific. It will be on our list of favorites when in the Sandestin area",5,misskitty,Nashville

Amazing...my 2nd year in a row going there for dinner while visiting Destin.  Excellent service and two of the best meals  I've ever had...I am in sales with a national food distributor and have v recommended this place to one if my own customers in Georgia.  He visited while in Florida and thanked me for the recommendation.  Please it on your list of things to do,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
The covered outdoor patio was perfect for fine dining with our kids.,5,OpenTable Diner,Nashville
"I selected this restaurant totally from  the ratings from Open Table for our family dinner while on vacation in Destin. Liz was our server and she was fabulous. We found the menu so enticing that  we had a difficult time trying to make a final decision as what to order. Everything was prepared  and presented to perfection ....and the dessert selections were amazing! The only negative thing I would add is that a 20% gratuity was added to our bill and there were five adults and one toddler who ordered. We are the kind of guests who tip heavily,as we are in the restaurant business ourselves, but my husband signed the check and left it at that. We can only assume that this is done because some people don't tip appropriately. We will definitely done and recommend this restaurant if one is looking for an upscale dining experience.",5,terri02,Orlando

Consistently incredible on all accounts!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Bijoux Bistro is always one of our ""go to's"" for consistent fine dining in Sandestin.  Their grouper almandine and fried oyster salad are two of my favorites. Specials are creative, as are the desserts, always served with their homemade ice cream. Our server on 7/22 was the best ever, but they are all great!",5,OpenTable Diner,Birmingham
"Hostess was rude. We asked to sit at a larger table and she told us she was full and then proceeded to sit aborhet party of 2 at a larger table. She couldn't easily accommodated us as we arrived before the other party she sat did. Our server was incredibly sweet and pleasant. Food was mediocre. Notable wine list perhaps if you order by the bottle, but wines by the glass were lacking.",3,Suzieli,Nashville
"Bijoux provides a simple, elegant setting for a special meal with friends or a romantic dinner for two. The service is what you would expect from a top notch restaurant. The menu offers nice variety, and the food was excellent. I highly recommend splurging on the fried green tomato appetizer! Highly recommended for a special occasion.",5,OpenTable Diner,Nashville
We had a very nice experience here and would recommend to those who hold fine dining near and dear. Cheap people and those who wear shorts and flip flops please step away from the restaurant!,5,NatPadget,Atlanta
We have eaten here on several occasions and it has always been consistent until our last visit. Four out of the six of us ordered filets. We all found it slightly tough and over cooked. We still enjoyed the atmosphere and other dishes ordered just won't be ordering the steak next time.,4,OpenTable Diner,Dallas
"My wife and I have been going to Destin/San Destin/30a for weekend getaways for the past several years.  We went to Bijoux on the advice from some one at Vintij (another great Destin restaurant).   The food, service, and ambience were great!  The tuna tartar was second to none, and both our entree's were perfect (red snapper and grouper).   Their cocktail menu was good and the wines were good and not over priced.  We will definitely return the next time we go to Destin/San Destin/30a.",5,OpenTable Diner,Mobile

"We had our wedding reception there and the service, food and atmosphere was perfect! We had a destination wedding, so I booked it online. The restaurant was beautiful.

I highly suggest this restaurant!!",5,OpenTable Diner,Nashville

My favorite place in Destin!  Best food and service!  Never disappoints and is so convenient on the beachside.,5,Happy,Tallahassee
"It was not a stellar food experience for  what we expected for a high-end restaurant. The service was excellent, and her server could not of been any better. It may have been our food choices but we took our waitresses suggestion. Lamb was just not 'great' as one would expect.  Scallop dinner was also not  memorable. It may have been better with the roasted cauliflower that was supposed to be part of the dish, but they were out of the cauliflower and had to substitute green beans.    Fried oyster salad was extremely good.",3,Johns,St. Louis
"Service was excellent, grouper was as described, very good. Oyster salad had big nice plump oysters also very good. We had the fried green tomatoes, different but would order again. Like the Baytowne location better however this was easy to get to and parking was no problem.",4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Our first visit to Bijoux was a winner. This will be a favorite for other trips to the South Walton beaches. The food was very creative, with lots of interesting flavors and textures. The chef enjoys  exploring the ways foods can be pleasurable. The offerings are far beyond ""good ingredients prepared well"". This meal was fun. Our server Michael was attentive and helpful in exploring the possibilities available in the evening's menu. Special kudos to the chef for the pineapple cobbler with coconut ice cream (""grandmother's recipe"") my wife enjoyed for dessert !",5,Zetaori,Birmingham
"What an excellent find, sequestered in the middle of a small office-building complex. Classic  and very tasty preparations of all the dishes, from starters through main courses to desserts. Very good wine selection to appropriately match the food (although I'd like to see a few more wines from Europe). Perfect service that was there when needed and not hovering at the table when I was busy eating. Mellow overall vibe, with cooler colors in the dining room, low-but-sufficient lighting, and nice trip-hop/sedate jazzy electronica music playing softly on the curated Pandora soundtrack.",5,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
Great food. Great atmosphere. Plan to go back again next time I am in town.,5,DMNashville,Nashville
"During the summer high season on Saturday night at prime time the hostess staff seated us promptly with smiles and professionalism. Our server was assigned two large groups but appeared in less than a minute to take our beverage order. Expertly mixed martinis arrived shorty. The Bijoux books a number of large groups but our food quality, presentation, and timely delivery could not be faulted.  We have repeatedly dined at the top five establishments in Destin for years and rate this spot number two only because it lacks the ocean front view of one other fine dining restaurant. If you are not a view-a-ahololic, this is the best of beach city fine dining.",5,fasteddy,E. Tennessee
We are big fans of Bijoux!! We are locals and this is one of favorite spots. The food is always consistent and great!  The staff is very professional and nice.,5,Comfort,Savannah
"The food and wine were very good.  Very noisy- they need a  noise dampening ceiling.  There was a party in the private room and Bijoux seemed understaffed, though my server was as attentive as possible in the situation.",4,SkyQueen74,New Mexico
Solid Food and excellent Cocktails. Steaks very well prepared. Oyster salad was very good. 2/2 so far when eating there in terms of quality of food and service.,4,ChadMac,Birmingham
We were visiting from out of state and wanted a nice meal after several beach days.   Bijoux did not disappoint.  It was a very special atmosphere.  Dark blue wall and white chairs.  Beautiful.  Quiet.  Great menu with good options.  Delicious.   And our server was attentive and efficient.  Expensive and worth it!,5,Debs,Dallas
"Outstanding experience. Food was exceptional. Waitress was friendly, made excellent recommendations, and was very attentive. Atmosphere elegant casual.",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"Amazing meal, service was a bit slow but not terrible. Excellent cocktails!",5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"While visiting Sandestin for the weekend, I took my wife to Bijoux for her birthday on Saturday, June 17, 2017.  I can't say enough about how good the food was.  My wife had the grouper almondine and I had the file mignon.  We live in New Orleans and would easily place Bijoux's  food in the top 10 amongst similar New Orleans restaurants.  That said, my wife and I were  very displeased with the service we received from our waitress, Betsy.  Soon after our drink order was taken, Betsy was assigned another table of 10 or so people.  From that point on, we received little to no attention from Betsy.  As I recall, she only returned to our table to take our order and provide our bill.  In fact, to get our bill we had to ask one of the helpers to pass the word on to Betsy that we were done.  It really is a shame that such wonderful meal was nearly ruined by an unprofessional staff member.  I plan on returning to your restaurant but pray the staff has been properly trained that every table no matter how big or small deserves service befitting a restaurant of your class.  Matthew",4,OpenTable Diner,New Orleans
Excellent food from appetizer to dessert wine. Well done Bijoux!,5,OpenTable Diner,Birmingham
"This was our second visit to Bijoux. The food was excellent as was the service. Our waitress was friendly and efficient. Had the crispy duck confit which was perfectly cooked and delicious. The fried oyster salad is not to be missed. My wife and I don't care much for fried oysters, but this salad is fantastic. We were in a back room which is rather small. The ambiance is next to nothing and the noise level was high. No effort is made in this room to dampen noise. Overall, our experience was very good and we'll be back.",4,DavidH,Tallahassee
"The food, drinks, and ambiance are wonderful, and the service is exceptional!!!  When we are in town, we always come for dinner!!",5,OpenTable Diner,Memphis
"Bijoux never disappoints. Food is always delicious, service great.",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"Delicious food, attentive and knowledgeable servers and lovely atmosphere",5,Jane,New Orleans
"Been here many times but its been a while.  This past weekend we were again not disappointed. The food is great, the staff wonderful and the ambiance what you'd expect of a restaurant of this caliber, refined but comfortable.  We drove in from New Orleans and arrived late evening and stopped in for late, quick dinner at the bar.  I ordered grouper almondine , my wife the blackened brie appetizer and a few drinks.  The fish was perfectly cooked, moist not dry, and the accompaniments perfectly paired.  The brie is a must do appetizer, wow! Totally wonderful start to our weekend.  Before leaving Sandestin on Sunday, we felt we had to try the brunch which we had never done.  No surprise, I ordered and enjoyed, with a glass of wine, the  best variation of Eggs Sardou that I have ever had, actually better than the traditional New Orleans original version!  My wife ordered the Shrimp and Grits...to die for!  This is a must do restaurant..you won't be disappointed unless you never get here. The entire menu is exceptional.",5,LocalTreasure,New Orleans
Best rack of lamb in Destin - great service and wine selection. Home made deserts rock!!,5,MRMac,Tallahassee
"For the price it wasn't great.  It was so-so.  The tuna carpaccio appetizer, which is what I ordered for my meal, was mediocre at best.  And my husband's shrimp and grits just wasn't good.  The waitress recommended it, so he and I were both excited to try it.  It had no flavor.  The ready-made shrimp and grits at Publix is better.  I will say the drinks were very good and so were the salads.",3,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Best scallops EVER!!!,5,OpenTable Diner,New Orleans
Amazing!!!,5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
The atmosphere was nice. Loved the tablecloths etc unusual to find on the beach. The food was ok. I was disappointed with the food. The service was great!,3,OpenTable Diner,Los Angeles
Very good place and the food good and the wine was good to,5,maxs,Louisville
"It's a little gem tucked away in a strip mall.  While the menu may not be the most imaginative, it is well executed.  The happy hour bar menu is worth going for.  The bar staff and drinks are very good.  We had the fillet and the tuna.  Both dishes were very good.  The lobster spring roll was a total flop.  The tempura was soggy and tea noodles overcooked and mushy.  It may have just been an off night for the spring roll but mine was pretty bad.",4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
The restaurant was very clean and modern inside. They had a great bar. The service and food was delicious. We had our 2 young children with us and they created some off menu kid friendly options for them like 4oz filets and French fries. The homemade desserts were heavenly . The Brie appetizer is like a dessert in itself,5,BCDN,New Orleans
First time and we will be back!  Food was amazing as was the service.  Would recommend to anyone!,5,connections2eat,Nashville
The filet was amazing....probably the best I've ever had.  The creme brulee was very good.,5,WesleyL,Orlando
Fantastic atmosphere.  Food was amazing from start to finish (including complimentary bread).  Martinis were the best we've ever had.,5,BeauS,Dallas
"We celebrated our anniversary with a delicious dinner at Bijoux! The lobster rolls were great, but our main courses were outstanding! I had the filet topped with fresh crab and hubby had gulf shrimp and grits. It was the most delicious meal we've had in a long time!",5,LeslieF,San Francisco
"Fabulous atmosphere and food.  We enjoyed our latest meal while in San Destin.  Great location, as well.",5,JYS216,Atlanta
"We were seated very quickly and our water glasses filled right away. Then we waited, and waited, and waited almost 40 minutes to just get our drink order. By this time we were ready to give up and leave. We are locals and own a buisness and are asked all the time for great places to eat, this will not be on the list.",2,ScottH,Tallahassee
we have enjoyed the restaurant for years. the new location has only made it better.,5,douglasc,Atlanta
We always visit this restaurant when in the area and it never disappoints. We go there for more of a quiet upscale dining experience and have never really considered it kid-friendly however there were A LOT of small children there this last time we were there. It didn't ruin anything just wasn't the quiet romantic time we normally have.,4,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
Everything about our experience was fabulous. Betsy was our server and she was helpful and friendly. We visit Sandestin several times a year and always visit Bijoux. Definitely one of our favorite spots.,5,OpenTable Diner,Birmingham
"Best meal of the week for a family of foodies from Pennsylvania! Ate out 2 other nights, one just the parents at the ""#1 restaurant in the Destin area."" The other the whole family at one of the top rated Destin seafood houses. Booked Bijoux, attracted by the convenience of OpenTable reservations and proximity (less than a mile from our condo), for our final dining out experience. So glad we did! The baked oyster appetizer was flavorful, with the light cream sauce not overpowering the oysters. The shrimp and grits were excellent, the freshness of the shrimp apparent. My wife and daughter declared the filet the best they ever had. The mashed potatoes were also a hit. Desserts were wonderful. Pineapple cobbler with coconut ice cream. Yum!! With some knowledge, great wine deals are also available. We recommend Bijoux highly to anyone visiting the area, especially if on the Miramar Beach side of Destin.",4,Violoncelle74,Philadelphia
Service is fantastic Food is balanced flavors flow and don't over power the fresh taste of the seafood Go slow save room for desert and coffee,5,OpenTable Diner,Birmingham
Destins best fine dining and a must visit everything we are in the area. The fried lobster tail and steak is our favorite!,5,wjbii58,Dallas

Great service and incredible food in a beautifully appointed room!,5,sique,Los Angeles
"It took a little while for our server to appear, but everything went well aside from that. The rack of lamb and red snapper entrees were fantastic, as were the crab beignets for an app. Nice wine/scotch selection, too. We'll definitely be back on our next trip.",5,DanB,Birmingham
Great food and time,5,OpenTable Diner,Hawaii

"Wonderful experience. Top notch service, excellent food, good wine list, even the bar drinks were good.  The crab beignets and fried oyster salad are spectacular.  My wife especially enjoyed the profiteroles desert.  Thoroughly enjoyed the meal and will go back many times.",5,DavidH,Tallahassee
"Bijoux is our favorite restaurant in Destin- food selection is excellent and everything extremely well done  and presented beautifully.  Staff are wam, friendly, professional.  It is first restaurant in my experience offering goat cheese ice cream which is my favorite!  Seafood is fabulous and the lamb chops I had were perfect with a delicious mint couscous side- perfect!  We've traveled extensively in Italy- Bijoux matches any fine dining restaurant there .  Ambience is suitable for very special occasions.",5,SharonD,Birmingham
Awesome spot...our favorite in the Destin / Miramar Beach / 30A area.,5,OpenTable Diner,Louisville

We have a condo in Destin so visit regularly but this was the first time we tried this restaurant.  The food was outstanding as was the service.  I don't mind paying more for a meal if it is truly good food.  We loved the food and the restaurant atmosphere.,5,cbm29,Atlanta
"Use to be located in Baytown.  Much bigger nicer place now.  For upscale food in a resort dress, this is best food for 100 miles.  Full service staff.  Did excellent job.  Highly recommend any of the salads!!!  We all tried a different one.  Also all the entrees especially the fish but also filets were fantastic.",5,Travel21,Miami
Top notch wine menu.  Top notch cuisine.  Great plate presentations. Five stars all around. The specials are always amazing and unique.,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"What a great meal!  Every aspect was excellent...service, timing, food appearance,  food quality.  My wife and I had the grouper and snapper, and we agreed they were the best meals we've had in several years, and we eat fine ding quite often.  Very impressed...will be on our list every time we are in Destin!",5,OpenTable Diner,Birmingham
"The food at Bijoux is outstanding -- crab beignets and the fish special were delicious! Unfortunately, the staff were way shorthanded, making our experience less than ideal. While our water glasses stayed full , I wasn't able to get the wine I wanted after my cocktail until I was eating the last bite of my entrée.",3,kidmd,Mobile
"The decor and ambiance was amazing! The blackened Brie appetizer was delicious, the lobster spring roll was tasty but disconnected. Not sure why the spring roll wrap was added, it was strange and not appealing. Entrees: I got the special of flounder and it sounded amazing but the flavor was odd, to many things going on. It was friend cauliflower (I never found any-if so it was mushy) the Brussel Sprout leaves were charred but I could taste cauliflower (mind you never saw it) but cauliflower and Brussel sprouts ended up leaving a bitter aftertaste in the quinoa which was at the bottom of the dish. My boyfriend states that his dish had a lot going on too. Sometimes less is more. Would definitely return and give it another try if anything to have a drink in the beautiful setting.",3,JessMarie,Nashville
We've had dinner at Bistro Bijoux previously and have always been pleased. The new location is more elegant. The specialty cocktail menu looked great and we had a jalapeño infused watermelon martini. For a starter we had the blackened Brie. I also had the Beet salad. Our main course was the grouper dish and also the shrimp and grits. Dessert was the cheesecake. All was outstanding and I'd highly recommend any of these dishes. The service and atmosphere was also outstanding. For a date night or special occasion I don't think you could go wrong. We will be back.,5,StevenW,Mississippi
"Love the serene decore in the restaurant and the cool, modern feel in the lounge area. Good specialty drinks and nice wine list. Everything I've eaten has been delicious and I'm a foodie. Service is excellent. Some of my recs are: fried green tomatoes, tomato basil soup (French onion in season), cheese plate, chocolate mousse cake.",5,KayP,Memphis
"Food took so long, about 1 hour, by the time they brought part of it they forgot out part of our order, our waitress  forgot about us (Meaning we were never asked for refills until tip time, not asked if we were ok until we were leaving) ""Food made from scratch"" did not tasted from scratch. They said all the food was made from scratch but when they realized they have forgotten about part of our order it immediately was served. Too expensive for what you get, I rather go to Texas the Brazil or a place inside our resort. This place was horrible!!!!  Not fancy at all, the chairs are cheap and uncomfortable. On the bright we will not visit this place again!",1,OpenTable Diner,Dallas
"Food was excellent.  We had several appetizers,  all were very good.  Our party had both seafood and steak for main courses - everyone was very happy.  I also heard rave reviews on the mixed drinks.  I would definitely  recommend this to anyone looking for a special night out.",5,OpenTable Diner,E. Tennessee
"This was our first time to dine at Bijoux, we'll certainly return.  The Fried Oyster Salad was great, I'll always order this salad whenever we return.  We both had Grouper as the entree and really enjoyed our meal.",5,OpenTable Diner,Birmingham
"We had a reservation, but still had to wait more than 25 minutes to be seated.  The food was excellent.",4,DuneAllenGirl,San Francisco

Had a fantastic meal at Bijoux with work colleagues.  Everything was delicious and the service was perfect. Will definitely be back.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Horrible service. Over priced for the food and service. Called for a waiter, she  looked at me and turned right back around ignoring me completely.. horrible. Food took 40 min to get to the table. I ordered my guacamole spicy and the waiter admitted that he made it mild!! Realllyyy?!? He needed to remake it. Def won’t visit them again!",2,OpenTable Diner,Orlando
It was very nice to have a space in the back room that was quiet and which to celebrate with a group of people. The wait staff was lovely and accommodating and the food was terrific.,5,bt10011,New York Area
This Rosa Mexicana was quite a let down. It’s located in a beautiful space but offers mediocre service and food at best.  Points of contention: * we had to request a glass of water. * we had to request a second round of drinks. * we had to request the side dishes we ordered a second time. * the entrees came out spicey and smothered in sauce after a request to be mild and served on the side.  * we were told verbatim: “That’s the way it is in Mexican food” Overall it was a disappointing service  experience and one that is likely to deter  other visits.,3,Raymond1,New York Area
Loved the place!  Food was great. Server a little slow with the drinks.,5,jjsk,Orlando
"I reserved a booth as I needed it for a business dinner. They said all of the empty booths were reserved for a party larger than 2 and we were put up the stairs in a noisy, crowded, small 2-top. VERY disappointing.",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
i’ve been here every day since we had this reservation. BEST MEXICAN IN NEW YORK!!!! BEST MARGARITAS EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5,OpenTable Diner,Los Angeles
"Brought food out with appetizers, about 3 minutes after we ordered. Didn’t even have drinks yet.  Way too quick!!  Need to work on pacing of the meal.",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Only had the guac.  Fresh but more chunky than I'm used to.   Chips and salsa were good.  Expensive drinks.,3,Veggielover,New York Area
Waitress was phenomenal a little pricey for Mexican but the food was excellent,5,OpenTable Diner,Miami
I love this location especially since it is so close to my job. My only complaint is that I feel like evertytime I go there they change the way an item looks on the menu. The nachos is much smaller now...the pomegranate margarita is made differently.  They used to give you three dips with the chips now it is only one.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"We had a nice time.  Quick bite before seeing a show.  Waitress was great, very attentive.  Great drinks - guac is always delicious!  Highly recommend that!  Hostess was not so welcoming and attempted to put us at a small table upon my arrival.  When I inquired about a booth seating bc it was our date night she gave me resistance stating it was for a reservation 90 minutes from the time we arrived.  There were plenty of booths available at the time (3 in fact) and upon us leaving after dinner there were about four booths empty.",4,OpenTable Diner,Miami

Everytime I go to Rosa I am very satisfied with their food and service. I love to come here on lunch for my little get away from the hustle and bustle around my job. They also have a great happy hour and their Michelada's are AMAZZZ! Highly recommended.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Excellent Carnitas and Margaritas.  We ate there thee times during our Week long visit to New York.,5,Stormkaap,Sacramento
terrible guac and rubbery chicken.  hard to believe the guac had more tomatoes than avocado and had no salt. And took more than 20 minutes to arrive.,1,bethh,Miami
Kristen the manager is wonderful!  Makes you feel at home.,5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"Very uninspiring food. We asked for medium hot guacamole, got hot instead. Caesar Chicken Salad wad limp. No one there when we sat down, but had to flag waiter down to order our lunches.",2,BenNearSeattle,Seattle
"After visiting the Observatory at One World Trade Center, we took our 9 year old granddaughter here for her birthday dinner. The reservation was made through Open Table and I noted that it was a special occasion. I requested that they put a candle in whatever dessert our granddaughter ordered, if possible. The birthday was never mentioned to the waitress when we got there, yet at the end if the meal she brought a big piece of tres leches cake to the table, offered a Mexican sombrero to Bridget, and sang with us!  There was no charge for the cake, which was enough for the three of us, and it was delicious!  All our meals were very good. We chose Rosa Mexicano because Mexican is my granddaughters favorite and it was walking distance from the Freedom Tower.  My husband and I are relative ""newbies"" to Mexican cuisine; however, the waitress was excellent at guiding us through the menu and helping us choose our meals.  Good food and a fun evening!",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

"Was told to wait 15 minutes in the bar, after 45 minutes we asked if we could get our table.. got a table downstairs. Supercold with the AC. Nice hostess told us we would get something on the house (didn't happen). Wasnt that hungry anymore when food arrive, ate and left. Had better friday nights",2,Natalie,London
"I expected to be in for a decent meal, seeing I heard good things. But everything we ordered (we were 4 people and everyone got something different) tasted bad. Bland, better said. Even the guac! How is it possible to mess up guac? Maybe they had a bad day, but considering the price, I will never go back.",2,BusinessLunch,London
"I have eaten at Rosa Mexicana in the past (not this location), but was always very impressed with the food, not this time.   The tortilla chips were very average.  The guacamole was very good, but it was double the price of any Mexican restaurant that I eat in.  We ordered a margarita when we sat down, and had to remind our server 20 minutes later that we never received it.  For my entree  I ordered the chicken enchilada.  When it came to the table  I was told that the plate was very hot, which it was, but my food was not.  It was luke warm.  The enchilada also very over priced was not even that tasty.  My boyfriend ordered the braised brisket tacos, which had a great flavor, but also were luke warm.   All in all I had a very disappointing experience, and I felt it was very over priced for what it was.",1,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

Food was great! Service was excellent.,5,OpenTable Diner,Philadelphia
"Won't be coming back. The food pales compared to how it used to be. Now it's like a chain restaurant, complete with constant up-sell attempts. Waaaay over-pricedL $15 for a cup of guac? My prediction: Out of business in 18 months.",1,Bill,New York Area
"Met a friend for lunch, and had nice meal with a very nice margarita. It was quiet enough for us to talk and catch up. The waitstaff were attentive. It was my second time there, and I will go back again!",5,Howdythere,New York Area
I had the shrimp tacos - it was disappointing because the food came out cold and bland (both the shrimp and taco and the side of corn) ... skimpy portion for a $20 meal but at least the service was very attentive and my sangria and company of friends were above par...,3,MAYster,New York Area
"I am a big fan of Rosa going back to the early 1990s, when I used to live around the corner from the original restaurant (when it was half its current size).  What I am most disappointed about with the current incarnation -- both in Tribeca and elsewhere -- is the margaritas.  They used to be known as ""pink 'gitas"" and all one needed to say to get one was to ask the bartender (Roberto, in those days) for a ""frozen with salt"".  Now, they've changed the recipe for the worse, and they no longer have the bitter sweet taste they once had.  I cannot emphasize what a disappointment this is, but I suppose they are more bland and generic, which may go with the whole chain restaurant approach that Rosa seems to have adopted.",3,Jamie,New York Area
"Amazing food, great vibes, warm comfy space",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Delicious flavors and combinations everywhere that transcend the usual vegetarian limits.   Every course shared by our party of four was a winner and seemed much the same as when Pete Wells described them in his original NYT review.   The prompt but cold service detracted only modestly as the food is the star here.  However, as Wells pointed out, the roasted pineapple dessert that requires pre-ordering is tough to decide upon without having the full dessert menu for comparison.  When I pointed this problem out to our server, she made no effort to bring us the dessert list and just decided that my comment  meant we weren't ordering the pineapple.  So I suggest reading the full dessert list online before arriving.  Our consolation with the maple custard, huckleberries, walnuts &amp; cream fortunately was more than sufficient.",4,Stemcell,Philadelphia

The food was very good. Management have an awful philosophy of rushing guests at every step of the way. Hurrying up the ordering process and removing plates the second the last bite was taken. Table turnover should not be the goal of management,3,OpenTable Diner,Dallas

Went here to meet up with old friends. We chose Nix because of the one vegan in our group. Everyone loved it! Def get the cauliflower!,5,OpenTable Diner,Los Angeles
"Third time at Nix. I was expecting this place to be overhyped or the service to be terrible since it's so popular right now. However they seem to be doing a really good job. And not just once but three times. There is a customer service tone that's very friendly and affable. And the food exceeds expectations. I like that they are making vegetables popular again and even though I'm not a vegetarian, I think that this is the way people are eating now and it is a good direction overall.",5,globaleater,New York Area

I am not a vegetarian.  But Nix was great.  Amazing variety of flavors.  Don't think I've ever enjoyed a meatless meal so much.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Having just begun serving brunch, we were curious to see if the food At Nix would be as good as it is for dinner. It was all delicious, but the standouts weren't the main courses. They were the two items we ordered as our ""starters"" -  the walnut buns with cream cheese frosting (which comes in a little pot, so you can apply it yourself, which was great fun) AND the French Toast with orange marmalade, that may have been one of the great discoveries in a long time. Both of these dishes are $8, which seemed a bit steep at first, but the sheer pleasure of eating both made the cost well worth it. And shared by two people, we were already quite full when our main courses (the ""tall"" quiche and the market scramble) arrived. Neither main was as good as the two starters, and the market scramble has some VERY spicy chili peppers mixed in, so the kick was quite storing and after a while, too much for this spicy palate. All in all, a very good experience.  The two starters could easily have served as dessert, and that would have probably been a better way to go. One last thing: regular coffee is $6!!! That sticker shock at the end of the meal put a real damper on our enthusiasm. Yes, they offer free refills, but it wasn't even that good coffee.",4,EVFoodie,New York Area
"Amazing from start to finish! I'm not even a vegetarian, and I thought this was one of the best dinners I've had in ages.",5,LisaP,San Francisco
"I recommended Nix to my group of friends for dinner after seeing great reviews for the place when it opened. The food for the evening was great and we enjoyed exploring the vegetarian interpretations. The service on the other hand, was less than adequate.",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
I was blown away by this creative vegetarian cuisine! There were so many amazing flavors and textures one does not typically associate with vegetarian cuisine. Nix is just as much a star in the non veggie world as it is in the veggie world!,5,esob89,New York Area
"Our waitress was quite adamant that we order more food than my party was interested in, essentially coercing us into ordering one additional dish. Other than the service, the meal was outstanding--terrific food, a great space and good cocktails.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Great restaurant with solid vegan options. I tried the eggplant/pine nut and red pepper/walnut dips with the flatbread. Neither was super exciting, but they were both tasty. And I love pine nuts, so I enjoyed them both. The nuts in both dishes could have been toasted. That would have added something to the dish. From the Lighter menu I tried the watermelon with jerk seasoning. It could have used more seasoning, as I didnt find it very spicy. The melon was fresh and juicy, and whatever was on the top (some sort of cheese alternative?) was pretty good and I hate all cheese. I'm weird, I know. For the main course, I tried the mushroom crepe with charred asparagus. It was fantastic! The crepe was served under the mushrooms and asparagus, so I kind of missed the crepe-like-ness of the dish, but the flavor was excellent. Dessert was by far the BEST course - I had the chocolate mousse cake with passion fruit. So soft and moist and the passion fruit was tart and well balanced with cocoa nibs. Sooooo good! Overall, versus other vegan restaurants I've been to, it was in the top quartile. I'd go back and try more of their menu. Only real complaint was how loud it was! Small restaurant, but they need more on the walls to absorb sound.",4,ArynY,San Francisco
"Experienced Nix Restaurant many, many times and still the best vegetarian restaurant in NYC!!! I'll recommend this place for a vegetarian as well as non vegetarian people...",4,WallyN,New York Area
"Visit for celebratory occasion and pleasantly welcomed by casual modern ambiance, professional service and delicious upscale dining experience. Would visit again, would recommend to friends.",4,GabrielL,New York Area
"We went for the first-ever brunch service and loved everything we ate. We never got one of our side dishes (we had to ask for it to be credited back on the check) and the service was a little uneven, but nothing that I wouldn't overlook. Definitely a winner and a great place for discerning vegetarian and vegan foodies!",4,electricmizmar,New York Area
"we were looking for a veggie restaurant and found nix a good place to go.  the menu is not big but offers some good and creative dishes. the idea of nix is that people share their meals and therefore the courses are not too big. food was very good and tasty. service was very attentive and friendly.  only downside is the noise level, as there is pretty loud background music and reminded us more of a bar than a restaurant.",4,alfi,Raum Frankfurt
I'm a vegetarian and was really pleased with the food here.  Everything we ordered was delicious including the cocktails.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"This is a lovely restaurant, particularly for the vegetarians.  The service is friendly and fairly good and the food is creative tho a bit on the spicy side. The cocktails are amazing!",5,jane,New York Area
Absolutely delicious !!,5,OpenTable Diner,New Orleans
Carefully prepared vegetarian menu. Some of the dishes were a bit on the bland side but most were well-seasoned and tasty. A lovely room that is quiet enough for conversation!,4,DanH,New York Area
"Excellent Food! Nix was great from top to bottom. A little pricey, but that's not unexpected in NYC. Their appetizers and small plates were great to start with. The entrees (large plates) were delicious as well! I wish they had some sweeter wines, but I can't complain too much because the food was so good!",5,Wonderful,Baltimore
All of the dips were so good. Carrots in parchment were delicious. Cauliflower with steam buns were fantastic,5,noraloo,New York Area
"Exceptional food, when visiting Sandestin we go at least two times.  There Lobster Roll is awesome and also a very good choice of Entrees. Service is incrediably good,  attentative but not over powering.",5,OpenTable Diner,Nashville
The menu is small but very special. Every bite we had was superb and this restaurant is just plain elegant. Can't wait to go again!,5,OpenTable Diner,St. Louis
"Pretty pricy. All 3 of us had steaks, no appetizer or salad, 2 total glasses of wine and a coke. $200 + without the tip. Steaks were favorful but must say I have had better. Desert menu kind of sparse as well.",4,OpenTable Diner,New Orleans
The Brussel sprouts !,5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"Food was excellent, waiter was delightful and ambiance was great.",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
Bijoux is a wonderful  experience from the sexy bar to the great dining.  The bar is a nice place for a quiet drink and a moment to gather with friends before your great dinner.  Dinner is special and meals are carefully crafted with fresh ingredients then served by a caring and engaged wait staff.  The rack of lamb with eight ribs was very good and was beautifully presented.   The wine list is fairly priced and it includes some excellent wines rarely found in Florida.  Overall a very nice restaurant and a great evening out.,5,JC93,Tallahassee
Lobster spring rolls are amazing and the staff is second to none on recommendation and service.,5,OpenTable Diner,New Orleans
Everything was great it was the perfect Thanksgiving night out. Great service and amazing food!,5,LSConcoit,Houston
"My husband and I lived in sand destin from 2003-2008.  I worked as a server in fine dining all through college starting with Ruth's Chris and in Sandestin The Ocean Club.  A lot of fine dinning places are over priced in my opinion however that is not the case in this instance.  I have already spoke to at least 3 families that I know have trips planned to try this restaurant they fresh squeeze their cocktails and my blueberry martini was delicious.  We had the stuffed crab Beneits, the Brie soup, my husband ordered the steak that was cooked in duck fat and melts in your mouth unlike any other flavor and crispy outside.  We couldn't believe how amazing it was! My fish was delishes too!  We had the coffe cheesecake for dessert!  We are from Louisiana and pride ourselves on good food! I am not exaggerating when I say this is far the very best restaurant we've ever eaten at! And yes we have eaten at many high end chef restaurants in New Orleans like John Folse and others! We will always make a reservation here every time we come to visit each year.  Wish we had a restaurant like this in Baton Rouge!",5,OpenTable Diner,New Orleans
"We really enjoyed this restaurant. We had our reservation scheduled a bit earlier than most, which was great because we were seated immediately. Our server,  Mike, was wonderful, cordial and extremely knowledgeable regarding the menu. He was quick to deliver our drinks and take our food order.   The duck confit appetizer came out rather speedily and was the most delicious foodstuff I've tasted in a great while. My beau ordered the filet and it was cooked to perfection; it was a gorgeous steak. And I enjoyed the delectable airline chicken breast with polenta and roasted brussel sprouts; it was all incredible.   We travel all around quite a bit, and endeavor to eat at one fine dining establishment wherever we go. Suffice it to say, we were ever so pleased with Bijoux as our choice for Destin.",5,Gabbi,Tallahassee
Food was good but not worth the price very expensive,3,Vacationer,E. Tennessee
Food was excellent.  Our server was excellent.  Ambiance was excellent!  We will return when we are in the area.  Little pricey but great place for special occasions and just to have a wonderful dinner!,5,OpenTable Diner,Salt Lake City
Bijoux remains one of the very few Destin fine dining destinations that has consistently excellent food and service in a wonderful environment.  We dine at Bijoux several times per year.,4,TxBamaEx,Houston
The service we had was outstanding from the moment we arrived until we left.  The food more than met our expectations.  It was the perfect spot for a special birthday dinner on our girls' trip.,5,Anda,Nashville
Excellent fine dining in Sandestin.  Food was well prepared and fresh.  Service was well paced and friendly but not intrusive.  We especially envied the quiet sophisticated atmosphere.   Good quality and value for such fine dining,5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee

Best  restaurant in Sandestin area  A little pricey but worth it,5,OpenTable Diner,Nashville
It is listed as a fine dining experience and it was just that. I wanted an experience that would be very nice for my fiancé and it was just what I was looking for. Our waiter Michael was first class! The whole visit was better than expected and each dish was a work of art! You truely get what you pay for here. Dessert was great as well...recommend the cheesecake.

This is our favorite restaurant in Destin and our favorite waitress Betsy.,5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"The Bijoux website is very misleading.  It promoted a ""Sunset"" prefix menu if ordered by 6PM.  We  made reservations for 5:15PM.  When we arrived we were told the prefix menu had long since been replaced with a bar menu that consisted of the usual nipple food you expect to find in a bar.  We stayed, ordered from the dinner menu. The food was fine, service ok, but we paid double the price we had planned to pay.  An updated website for this place is a must! There is no excuse for such marketing given the cost of dining at this establisment.",3,OpenTable Diner,Shreveport
"Wonderful dining experience. Excellent service. Grouper, beef filet, lamb. All wonderful. Blackened Brie appetizer and the fried oyster salad are pure perfection",5,OpenTable Diner,West Virginia

"My girlfriend and I were staying in Destin for our anniversary. We literally stumbled onto Bijoux while searching the Internet for good steak &amp; fine dining. Our original reservations got cancelled. It was hands down the best meal of our lives!!! Wonderful atmosphere, great wait staff &amp; amazing food. Pork belly appetizer &amp; fried oyster salads were fantastic!  Our steaks were perfect!!! The pineapple cobbler with homemade coconut ice cream was unbelievably delicious!!! Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable and gave very good suggestions. Thanks so much to Bijoux for the best dining experience of our lives!!! We will most definitely eat there again, anytime were in town.",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"Great local alternative to Fleming's Steak House or Ruth's Chris in Destin. Ultra-attentive, yet unperceptible, service left us wanting for nothing. The cuisine was superb.",5,Keysdiver,Tallahassee
Great dining for a date or just somewhere for good food. Small menu but the food is quality. I do recommend this restaurant,4,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"We liked the food and service, we were a little disappointed that in this area they did not have sweet tea, my wife was disappointed that they did not have mahi-mahi or salmon on the menu, but their fish special was very good and complex as food flavors and textures go.",4,sdaldhunter,Tallahassee

"Dinner was great, good wine , beautiful &amp; quiet restaurant. Elizabeth was very attentive &amp; helpful , but as the restaurant got busier, she didn't seem to have much help. Maybe staff was low that night. Not her fault. We'll be back!",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
Delicious meal and lovely restaurant. It was somewhat noisy but we will definitely return.,4,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"WoW! We've had a few top-shelf tasting-menu meals lately, and this one was the clear champ. Every dish we tried was thoughtful, interesting, and perfectly-executed. No mis-fires at all. Lovely wines and understated but super-fresh cocktails. It feels to me like a European restaurant given the cozy size &amp; decor, and the attentive, skilled, but low-key staff. This is not a staff that's trying to make you feel like a coddled millionaire, nor like an over-privileged hipster foodie. They're just really helpful and really unobtrusive. For us, it was... just right.",5,Merlin3,Washington DC
Another wonderful meal at Mas Farmhouse. We love that fact that the chef is willing to let the patrons design their own menu. Outstanding food. My only complaint is that the tables in the front room are really too close to each other but the quality of the food and the service overshadows this problem.,5,likestoeat,New York Area
The dishes are so wonderful and tasty that the whole experience (eating!) makes a great evening.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"AMAZING food! We couldn't believe it has been around for 9 years, and we had never been. We did the chef's choice 6 course tasting menu. Each dish was fantastic. And, the wines were paired perfectly. We can't wait to go back and bring friends!",5,nickname,New York Area
"Best food, service, ambiance. highly recommend!",5,Lisa,New York Area
"With the excecption of a tuna appetizer, all the dishes came out bland and underseasoned. They sound wonderful on the menu but execution is average at best, especially at these prices. We went on a Sunday night and wondered if the main chef had the day off. The wine list is incredibly overpriced and has very few selections under $100. Their wines by the glass are $20-$25 each and are lousy. No need to come back here.",2,Spongy,New York Area
The hostess makes you want to feel as though you are lucky to be there. Thankfully the food makes up for the attitude.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Enjoyed a fantastic dinner here with my girlfriend for our Valentine's Day Dinner. Far and away one of the best meals I have ever had.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
A wonderful dining experience with fabulous service. Tremendous flexibility in mixing dishes for the varied 4 or 6 course dinner.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"2/16/12 In a word: disappointing. The food was OK - not outstanding. My shrimp crusted spaghetti squash salad was mediocre - I think I could have found something better around China Town. The monkfish and sweetbreads was delicious; the duck was not that great. Food could have been hotter. The service was OK; but, when you do not leave the wine bottle on our table (they keep it in a back area) you better be extra good at making sure my wine glass is never empty! It was frequently! I felt rushed for our 8:45 reservation; I think they were trying to plate and serve our food before the masses that arrived circa 9/9:15 ordered. I wanted to love Mas. But, you may be better off going to Blue Hill, Recette, L'Artusi, Barbuto, etc.",4,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
Excellent as always. Service and food were outstanding. What else is there to say ?????,5,anonymous,New York Area
Good but not outstanding. Definitely not for the price. Happy to cross-checked it from my list but won't go back. Service is impeccable but the food is not to the level expected. Starters were super good but entrees were disapointing.  Wine list is extensive but wine by the glass are super expensive for the quality offered.  Overpriced by 30%.,3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Our server Colin was actually a master sommelier masquerading as server (we think)... Amazing food and wine. Wines were unlike anything we'd ever tasted before. Totally new sensations. Food tastes better, and lacks the dainty pretentiousness and lack of actual good taste of several 3 Star Michelin restaurants we've dined at in the city. Relaxing ambiance and mellow, but well-selected background music (I had to Shazam at least once) make it a wonderful setting for conversation.",5,DavidR,Miami
"We had a wonderful experience dining at Mas Farmhouse for our anniversary. The food was excellent, the menu inventive and the chef very accomodating. The service was friendly, attentive and helpful.

"After reading all the reviews for Mas I was expecting a stellar meal. What I got, however, was an inventive menu with stellar ingredients prepared in a very mediocre manner. Everyone at our table chose the prixe fix menu. It was lovely to choose from the entire menu for your choices, but disappointing when they were served cold or lukewarm at best - some of the items in one menu choice were cold and other components in the same dish were warm. Even the coffee needed to be sent back because it was cold. Another disappointment was the wine selection. As I recall the least expensive bottle of white wine was $85 and the server seemed surprised we thought that was expensive. All in all the evening was a disappointment.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Small, quiet, with expert and attentive service, and exquisite food. Unlike most places, they will vary their tasting menu to your personal specifications - even if patrons at the same table prefer different dishes. All in all, one of the best dining experiences I've enjoyed.",5,AIR55,New York Area
"Overrated and expensive - food was disappointing. nice presentation but not a lot of flavor. The tuna tartar was too salty the soy overpowered it and it was stringy. My husband had the Mushroom dusted monk fish and sweetbreads and said he could not taste the difference between the sweetbreads and monk fish! it was all flavorless. The practice of 2 servers at each course felt a bit forced. certainly didn't match the tone of the bus boy who said ""want more bread, lady?"" They need to decide if they are farm to table or haute...",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
I had dinner there twice this week..and both times equally as wonderful! Food and service were spectacular. The attention to detail is great both in the food as well as the service....definitely one of my favorites in the city. Mas...don't change a thing!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Average food, every course was cold or burnt. Overpriced! Rude waiters who were laughing at us for not finishing our food. Horrible! I'll never go back",2,Chocolatey,New York Area
"From the moment we arrived, we felt welcomed by David and the rest of the Mas team.  The food was amazing from the outset. There was a great variety with a fixed price 4 course, a chef's taster menu of 6 courses or the a la carte menu, which was completely interchangeable with the other menus. The chef was extremely accomodating and would tailor the dishes to our own requirements.  I booked this based on the many reviews for a special occasion and the reviews were completely 100% spot on.  Well worth a visit....we came all the way from London!",5,LeeinLondon,London
"The only problem was that seated in the direct path of the door every time it opened there was a major draft felt. Obviously the outside entryway does not solve the problem. There were other open tables, so they could have seated us elsewhere and use that table only as a lost resort.",5,papmd,New York Area
"Went with another couple and all of us are discerning when it comes to food, service, and ambiance and MAS hit all three out of the park. Staff was engaging and knowledgable without being overbearing or intrusive. The chef's selections and flexibility were fantastic and much appreciated. The food was delicious and creative. I would definitely recommend MAS and am looking forward to coming back.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Food: Off the charts! I am a seafood lover and the poached lobster was the best lobster dish I have ever had outside of Maine (75+ lobster meals outside of Maine), and considerably better than many in Maine.  Wine: Delicious. I really liked the selection of wines by the glass (so important with multiple dishes), and our server did a perfect job with his recommended pairings.  Service: Prompt, attentive, warm, not hovering, great attitude, deep knowledge of the menu and wines. In a word, perfect. A bearded gentleman (David?) was our server, and we were also helped a bit by a taller clean-shaven gentleman (also David if I recall correctly?) who was also quite pleasant.  Wonderful spot for a date!",5,Robert,New York Area
Love the place. Especially the chef's six course tasting menu.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"stuck my group of 5 in the back room, service was extraordinarily slow and inattentive; very disappointing",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I took a friend here for her birthday since she wanted ""organic"" food. We both got the 6 or 7 course sample meal but it was obscenely expensive. Including tip, the bill was nearly $350 for just 2 people and we didn't drink a lot either. Everything on the menu is priced 25-50% higher than it should be. The service and food are good but not earth shattering, the décor is nothing special either. Tables are close together and on more than one occasion I rubbed elbows with the guy sitting next to me. At least we had a good laugh about it. This made no sense given that the restaurant was practically empty when we got there--why seat us right next to each other? For the money, I'd much prefer the non organic Four Seasons.",3,SJR1,Washington DC

"have eaten at Mas Farmhouse several times. the food and service are always exemplary. Excellent and interesting and different food. and the service is special. HOWEVER, i must make some very specific and important criticisms. 1. the tables are way way way too close together. if i wanted to have a special and expensive meal with strangers at my table, that is one thing. but to see how much time and effort goes into the food and then to have my neighbor literally AT MY TABLE with me, is just not acceptable and it doesn't go together. 2. the place is way way way too loud and noisy. can't hear my self think! with such effort made for the food and service, you would think that the owner would want his guest to have a special nite",4,jayb123,New York Area
More interesting and ambitious food than your everyday fabulous restaurant. The place has great food and a very pleasant personality.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Outstanding as usual. Food was exceptional and we experienced particularly good service this time around, especially after one of the guests in my party spilled an entire glass of red wine on himself.",5,ksd1,New York Area
"I have nothing but great things to say about Mas. The food was phenomenal. The service, top notch. The menu is quite flexible so if you plan on doing a form tasting menu dining this is the place for you. They allow you to choose whatever you'd like to taste on the menu to include in your tasting menu selecton. We elected to go with the chef's tasting menu which basically included items off and on the menu. We are not very picky eaters so we were willing to try anything that was served. Everything that was served was great. The lobster dish was probably the only dish that was a bit overcooked, but it was good nonetheless. The best dish was the scallop dish with shallots.  Definitely a place worth trying. I'd go back for more.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
The food was great and we really enjoyed the chef's tasting menu. Not too expensive for a tasting menu.,4,LauraG,New York Area

It is wonderful!,5,Jochiz,Las Vegas
The food was top notch.  My steak was cooked to perfection and as tasty as any I have ever had.   My wife had the shrimp and grits and really enjoyed them.  Our waiter was also very good.   Knew when to talk and when to just let us enjoy our meal.  We will be coming back.,5,OpenTable Diner,Dallas

"Bijoux is a top choice for diners along the Emerald Coast.  Great food served in an upscale environment by a seasoned waitstaff are Bijoux hallmarks.  We have been to Bijoux many times but this was our first New Years Eve dinner.  The dinner was a four course fixed prix affair but you were offered at least 5 options at each course.  Our group sampled virtually the entire menu and loved every course.  Despite the full restaurant the service was attentive, the food was delicious and the cocktails were spot on.  The wine list is reasonably priced and offers a decent variety of European and US wines.  Great choice for your next upscale meal.",5,JC93,Tallahassee
Typically you should expect slower service at this restaurant.  However on New Years Eve it was incredibly slow....nearly 3 hours for our party of three (6:45PM to 9:25PM).   For the cost you should get better!,3,OpenTable Diner,Houston
"Service was professional and courtious. Food choices were considerate with something available for various palets. Inviting atmosphere with a nice warm ambiance. Quality of food was right on and well presented. The only concern was the overall price. If I am going to pay $350.00 for a dinner and four drinks, I expect the staff to offer to take our heavy coats and hang them so we don't have to oddly hang an over coat off the back of our chairs. Any silver service establishment will extend that coutesy. With a such a top price point, the little things start to matter. The food and experience was very nice but I would be very reluctant to pay that much again.",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee

"Excellent wine, we really enjoyed ourselves!  Everything that our waiter suggested was very good,  She even suggested the wine we chose and it was excellent...we will be back again.",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
Wonderful!,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"From the moment we entered Bijoux, we were greeted and treated with gracious hospitality. Our waitress, Melissa was a delight. Our party of seven, was thrilled with our entrees. The desserts and after dinner drinks were divine. A lovely time, to celebrate the Christmas season and a beloved friend’s birthday!",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"Great food, service, and atmosphere. It was fancy and the service was just right, not over the top, timing of courses were perfect. Dress nice.",5,OpenTable Diner,Las Vegas
Great overall meal and experience.   Staff was very attentive and my filet was perfect.,5,OpenTable Diner,Nashville
"Bijoux always makes the evening special. Great food, great service, exceptional wine list and wonderful atmosphere.  We've never been disappointed!",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
Our waitress was super sweet! What a pleasant dinner for my mom and I.,5,OpenTable Diner,New Orleans
Far exceeded our expectations!!!  Superb dining experience.,5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
Had dinner here last week for the first time in years.  One of the best restaurants in town!  The ribeye is as good or better than you’ll get anywhere.,5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
Great food! Best steaks in town and also some of the best seafood. Brought our daughter and 3 teenage granddaughters and everyone cleaned their plates. Server was very attentive and sociable. She advised the girls that they could put any side they saw with any entree. Wine and dessert suggestions were wonderful.  Very pleasant evening. Everyone wants to back next time.,5,Redhummer,Atlanta
"We went for dinner the night after Thanksgiving looking for something different .  The menu has a variety of Vietnamese and New Orleans style recipes.  A favorite was the lamb chops, though we enjoyed each of the appetizers and main courses.",5,BroS,Kansas City
"Having visited this restaurant many times, I was a fan until this visit. I arrived around 8 on a Saturday night, and it was empty. That should have told me something. I said I had an Open Table reservation, and the host had no idea what I was talking about and derisively said, “We have plenty of open tables.” After that, he gave my date and I a single copy of the lunch menu and a wine menu. I asked another waiter if we could have two dinner menus, and he brought me just one. I found it really, really strange that they did not want to give us menus. I also found their extra surly manner really, really strange. Needless to say, we left and had dinner at another nearby restaurant. After all, they did not want us there, they were exceptionally rude, they were really strange about giving us menus, and if they’re going to be that bad about menus, I can only imagine the “mistakes” that would have been made with the food. I used to really like this place when the owner was personally there. Now, however, it has gone pretty far downhill and I will never return. It used to be something special, and now is just a below average restaurant in a strip mall. If being toyed with by surly waiters and hosts is your thing, you should definitely eat here. If you’re looking for good food and a good experience, however, you should try one of the other nearby restaurants.",1,BaconGuy,Tallahassee
"Have been there 2 times in 2 weeks.  My wife and I first and with one of our families the second time.  Atmosphere is quiet and pleasantly decorated.  Prompt, likable service.  Fusion menu that delights with good presentation.   Our daughter and family who dine at Tallahassee's hot spots really praised the menu and the food.  My wife and I agree and will make it one of our list of regular stops.",4,OpenTable Diner,Philadelphia
Excellent service &amp; even better food. Highly recommend this unassuming little place .,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Food was spectacular, great presentation - I would highly recommend eating dinner here.  The staff was very pleasant.  Enjoyed it very much!",5,Cristina,Atlanta
"My wife and I split the Filet meal.  It was tasty, but I am confident that we were served the Sirloin meal which was $14 cheaper.  When I asked the waitress, she didn't understand.  Then she proceeded to go back to the kitchen with menu to express our dissatisfaction.  She came back only saying that she didn't speak good English.  We paid the check and probably will not return.",3,BroadwayBenny,New Orleans
"Absolutely wonderful atmosphere, food, and service!!! Best place we ate at while in the Destin area. Thank you for such a pleasant experience!",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
Great little place for something different and delicious!,5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"Fabulous meal, short ribs were amazing. Highly recommend this place.",5,annc,Atlanta
"Very good, will go again when we are in the area",5,GoBucks,Birmingham
Exceptionally good food. Service wasn't quite as impeccable but  quite appropriate.   The mussels were some of the best we have had.,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Wonderful food!   The menu had so many great choices.,4,augirl1986,Atlanta
This is an excellent restaurant.  The Korean shorty ribs were wonderful.  The lemongrass chicken to die for.   Reasonably priced.  A great time was had by all.,5,DocGourmand,Louisville
"We loved this restaurant, most of us got the Asian cuisine but they have great French cuisine choices. Everything was very fresh, the flavors were interesting and the prices were ridiculously reasonable. I had the yellow curry and it was amazing. The restaurant wasn't very crowded and I do not understand why except that it's located in a shopping center and maybe people don't understand it? In a city this place would be packed. The wine list needs some work but the food is beautiful and delicious.",5,SaraD,Cambridge
"Went back the second time during our week vacation.  Food was outstanding again.  Very enjoyable.   Service was very good and while the one waitress was new, she was very friendly and sought out help when she needed it.   Will definitely go back when we return to the area.",4,Shaferdude,St. Louis
"Went with friends for anniversary meal - empty restaurant should have warned us but good reviews had brought us to baguette bistro. The waitress who served us obviously struggled with the language and when our drinks came they weren't what we ordered but we let that pass. Our starters were ok and my wife's main course was tasty she said - mine ,however, was very bland . The problem was that the main course arrived whilst my wife was still eating her starter and the bill arrived whilst we were in the middle of our main course. The option of having a dessert or another drink was obviously not considered. From start to finish we were at the restaurant for 40 minutes which for a two course meal with drinks is ridiculous. The pricing was reasonable had the food been tastier but generally I cannot recommend this restaurant and now understand why it was empty of customers.",2,OpenTable Diner,Cumbria
First time we have visited as we are in the area for vacation. Food was outstanding. Our server was friendly and helpful. Plan on returning soon!,5,Shaferdude,St. Louis
"It's in a shopping plaza. The Rack of Lamb was very good, but the Chicken, Shrimp and Pasta was ordinary.  We had Mussels to start and a few were not open but nicely prepared.  No need for reservation here.  On Mother's Day there were 12 people in the restaurant.  No atmosphere, just hard surfaces.",3,MothersDay,Orlando
"Excellent Food.  Great atmosphere.  After the Mothers Day meal with my wife and 4 daughters... It was so good, one of the daughters brought her husband back here the next day....",5,CaptainDave,Atlanta
Arrived an hour before closing.  Only a few people left.  Staff was extremely helpful and prompt.  It was hard to choose from all the French/Vietnamese/Cajun choices on the menu.  I had the Arugula Salad with grilled Chicken.  Very Favorable.,5,Oldschoolfoodie,Atlanta
Best food we have had in Destin and one of the best French/Vietnamese fusion meals I've had. Thanks for the great evening!,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Outstanding in every way! We've been coming since beginning &amp; never disappointed. Chef Jack &amp; all go out of their way to make you feel special.,5,keithg,Las Vegas
"THE BEST restaurant in Destin.  From Wine and Apps to Dinner and Specialty cocktails nothing isn't amazing.   If you are looking for a special night out that you will talk about for days past, go to Bijoux.",5,MollyRose,Tallahassee
"Dinner was outstanding, but what made the evening extra special was the genuinely friendly and balanced attentive service we received from Michael. His enthusiasm for, and knowledge of, the food and its preparation make him a partner in what makes Bijoux such a special experience. While we reside in Pittsburgh, Bijoux will be on our ""must do"" list next time in the Gulf. The food and the experience were worth more than we paid.",5,OpenTable Diner,Pittsburgh
lovely meal      1st time for any of us to eat Vietnamese  If ever in the area again... will make this a first stop,5,roni,Tallahassee
Wonderful eclectic food! Enjoyed every minute of our experience. Go for the beef appetizer and you won't be disappointed. Flavor is awesome!,5,LindzEdmondz,Birmingham
"Amazing! Tried something new, the yellow curry, and it was fantastic! Pho was great, as always!",5,OpenTable Diner,Las Vegas
"We ordered the tofu entree, the salmon entree, and the lemongrass chicken entree with ginger.  All three entrees were fresh and delicious.  Very good portions  One person in our party only eats vegan food so that is why we went to this restaurant.  Actually, all the food was delicious.  We would return to this restaurant.  A hidden gem.",4,Enjoyfood,Columbus
"I have been for lunch and dinner, both times service was excellent. Food is delicious, portions are large. For lunch our favorites are Mango Chicken Wrap and Southern Chicken Sandwich. For dinner the Pho and Ginger Chicken is excellent. We will be back.",5,SarahB,Tallahassee
A great alternative to fancy.  This place is casual with creative food done fusion style.  Service was great and the price was incredibly good.  A great find.,4,OpenTable Diner,Miami
"The food is reasonable in price, however they are out of their main entrees",2,OpenTable Diner,Washington DC
"Overall I thought this was a nice change of pace from the common types of dinner options my wife and I enjoy. This was a really nice twist on French and Thai food, and they did a really nice job with it. The location is perfect to walk across the parking lot to the local wine/cigar/cheese place to further enjoy your night out. The prices were great, the service was friendly, and the atmosphere was peaceful and nice. Overall, I thought it was a great place if you wanted a change of pace.",4,OpenTable Diner,Washington DC
Egg rolls and shrimp curry were quite good and the service was excellent and friendly. The beer was cold and the serving large. The beef appetizer was excellent.,4,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
Very good food and service. We both had the curry shrimp.,5,AT56,Washington DC
First time there. Food was awesome! Service was great! Highly recommend them! We will definitely go back the next time we are in Destin!,5,Einsteins,Orlando
"Awesome food! Highly recommend the beef Pho! Tried the crispy beef ravioli, it was fantastic!! Have always enjoyed everything I've tried! :)",5,OpenTable Diner,Las Vegas
"Even though we only get to the Emerald Coast a few times a year, we are THRILLED to have this as a new dining option. Sampled dishes from both the Vietnamese and French portions of the menu and all slayed!",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
Great selection and fabulous tasting food. Unique combinations of ingredients.,4,Destin,New York Area
"Try the rack of lamb. The chicken dishes had a weird consistency to the chicken, like it had been reheated from a few days before",3,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
We very much enjoyed the curry dish &amp; spring rolls.  Lemongrass chicken was tasty as well.  Good change of pace from fried seafood &amp; loudness of many places here!,4,OpenTable Diner,Nashville
"Destin is known for its seafood, but we were in the mood for something different.  When I saw the Baguette Bistro offered Pho, I knew we had to go there for dinner.  It was fantastic!!!We ordered the eggrolls and beef rillettes, both of which were delicious.  The star was the Pho.  Hot, aromatic and delicious with an abundance of things to add to it.  We will definitely go back and I have already posted how wonderful it was on Facebook.  Loved it!!!!",5,OpenTable Diner,Birmingham
"Great food at reasonable prices, nice change to the local sea food offerings",4,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"Great food in a beautiful setting.  Portions very large, so think about sharing some of the appetizers or salads!",5,OpenTable Diner,Washington DC
Beautiful place and lovely staff. The food is excellent. It’s a perfect special occasion venue. Be sure and ask for Anastasia; she an excellent server and absolutely charming!,5,Ludu,Washington DC
"Drinks were delicious. Food was delicious. Server did not present the dinner special right, however-HUGE disappointment. He said it was LOCAL SNAPPER and it was non local salmon. We eat salmon all the time. My filet was ordered medium and it was served medium well, they re made it and it was medium rare-it was delicious none the less second time around. We were also charged for both dishes still after two large disappointments. Not sure we will be back for dinner service, maybe a cocktail at the bar.",2,OpenTable Diner,Jacksonville
"We were there on a night when it was empty.  Hard to judge ambience when there is no other energy in the room.  Jennifer, our waitress, was terrific.",4,gregm,Pinehurst
Wonderful dining experience from start to finish. Oysters on the half shell were accompanied by some fresh sauces that set them off. Fried cauliflower was sumptuous. Paella had the right crust and an excellent variety of seafood. Orange chocolate martini was a great finish to a good meal. Service was spot on. Knowledgeable server who was attentive without hovering. Beautifully appointed dining room.,5,Leese,Nashville
"Food was sub-par. Rice was the consistency of mashed potatoes. Wonderful ambience, terrible food. Mashed potatoes that accompanied the ribeye was the only highlight.",2,OpenTable Diner,San Antonio
"The food was OK, not exceptional. The service was pleasant, but more training is necessary. Our entree was placed on the table while we were still eating our salad. Is no one trained to ""serve from the left, remove from the right"" anymore?",4,OpenTable Diner,Denver
Great all around! My husband and I always declare a “winner” for whose meal was the best. For the first time we had a tie! Both were so good we couldn’t decide. He had the red fish special and I had the blackened snapper. Appears you can’t go wrong here.,5,JillP,Tallahassee
Excellent food and service. Great selection of food and drinks,5,Larry,New Orleans
We enjoyed a nice Sunday Brunch. The meal and staff were perfect. Will return again in the future.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The Primrose was outstanding in many ways. Our waitress, Anastasia, was exceptionally friendly and competent. The food was delicious and enjoyed by all. The atmosphere was beyond beautiful. It was exceptional in every way. Loved this place so much we will return.",5,OpenTable Diner,Seattle
"Big disappointment - heirloom tomato salad made up of tomatoes with no flavor , Blackened Snapper, tiny portion(2""x2""x 1/2""), over cooked (mushy) on a bed of something ?? Filet overcooked and way over salted. Passion fruit creme brûlée topped with a strawberry and what looked and tasted like chunky apple sauce. Overall way overpriced for the quality of the meal especially the snapper. Better places with really good food in the area.",2,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"We had a lovely experience at Primrose, once we found it. Instead of following GPS, pull into The Henderson entrance and drive up to the valet area. Once inside, take a left, and another left after the check in desk. The service was great. There were many small touches, like a little honey pot and sliced lemon with my tea, and a cute little purse stool. Great sushi and serene environment. Definitely recommended!",5,OpenTable Diner,E. Tennessee
The food was good and the restaurant was lovely. The service needs work and there should be some sort of dress code for the guests and staff considering the price point.,3,Carpool,Atlanta
We had high expectations given the chef's touted experience but none of the flavors worked. Very disappointing if you consider yourself even somewhat of a foodie.,3,OpenTable Diner,Nashville
"It was our first time staying at the Henderson, though we've gone to Destin for 20+ years. The restaurant was very well designed with good lighting, comfortable seating, and beautiful local art. Our server was attentive and accommodating; I had a food allergy for which she was able to easily sub another side, and she created a vegetarian plate for another guest. The sushi we had to start was very creative and tasty, and the portions for the entrees were a good size. After dinner, we moved to the bar for a nightcap and the waitress brought our drinks to us once we moved to the veranda. I look forward to going back on our next stay!",5,gigi,Austin
We ate at  top five restaurants as reviewed on Travel Channel and this was the best meal we had. Highly recommend!,5,BDoots,Tallahassee
A highly anticipated addition to the Emerald Coast! The cauliflower and burrata appetizers were top-notch. Chef fuses global flavors into the local cuisine for a unique and delicious experience. This will undoubtedly be worked into our routine while in the area.,5,William,London
"Chicken and okra stew was amazing, everything was delicious.",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"Food was very good with local seafood featured. Service started out great, but then lagged as dinner went on. Appetizers were not brought out together. Waitress seem to disappear at times.",3,CAB33,Philadelphia
Everything about our experience was positive. From great food to beautiful views of the gulf and dunes to the atmosphere but the service by far was most exceptional.  Highly recommend!,5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
The Blackened and Chef Special Snapper was fantastic!  The Chocolate Lava cake with Peanut Butter was the best we have ever had.  Foodies will be happy here.,5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"I took my daughter there for her 20th  birthday and it lived up to our expectations, we had a lovely time.",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
They took their baked oysters off the menu and replaced them with raw oysters that were way too small for $3 a piece.  The grouper was overcooked and lacked flavor except being extremely salty.  The pork shank was the best thing going.  Full of flavor and very tender.  Our server was great and Bobby at the bar was excellent.,3,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
I have been to Primrose four times. This restaurant has so much potential but they really need to step up their service.  The waitress was pleasant but had too many tables considering the physical size of the restaurant.  Food does not always come out at the proper time which is very annoying. It's a shame because the ambiance and food quality is good. And the  sushi is the best in the area   But waiting too long  for tea refill or for some one to bring you the salt you asked for while your food gets cold makes me not want to go back.  Once one of  the four entrees  we ordered came so late  he other three diners  had finished eating. Please Primrose hire more wait staff   Have the kitchen get all entrees and sides out at the same time. (I realize sushi comes out whenever it's ready and that's ok)    You have a diamond  in the rough. Polish it,3,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
"We had an enjoyable evening.  The food was delicious. We had the blackened snapper, shrimp and gritcake, and the roasted cauliflower for an appetizer.  They were all wonderful.  The only problem we experienced was when we tried to order a couple of things they were already out by our dinner at 6:15. Other than that we would recommend it to anyone looking for a classy and enjoyable date night.",4,ambie,Phoenix
Unfortunately food was not good. Everything was very salty. Steak was served rare. Staffing was nice but very slow which I didn't understand seeing how there were only 3 other tables dining in. Huge dissatisfaction expected more especially because they rolled out a new dinner menu. Not a great start,2,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"Excellent food and service. Prices high, so save for a special occasion.",4,Buffs,Houston
"Wife and I were celebrating our Golden Anniversary, and I guess I expected more on behalf of the Primrose Restaurant to acknowledge the occasion beyond the waitress simply congratulating us on our special anniversary -- no flower for the wife, no special price for any extra offering, nothing of the sort. Our server Anastasia was outstanding in every way. For a 5-star restaurant in a beach resort, I found the menu extremely limited -- one chicken dish, two steak options, a lamb rack, four seafood options, and a vegan platter (no pork, baby back ribs, prime rib, lobster, surf &amp; turf combo, etc.) The 'ala carte' dinner pricing plan is outrageously high -- $36 for a 10oz Ribeye, and if you want a salad ($11) and a vegetable (only one selection @ $6), you pay $53 for the meal. Finally, I ordered my steak grilled medium and it was delivered well done. It was tastily seasoned and I would have rated it outstanding had it been grilled to my requested medium doneness. An overall disappointment on our Golden Anniversary!",3,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
Entres very expensive. Reservations at 7:15pm. Ordered meal at 7:30pm. Meal arrived at 8:30pm. And this was a Tuesday night!,4,Ivey,Nashville
Dinner was delicious!  We had the lamb and loved the sauce with it!  Everything was outstanding!  The service was great!  The staff was very friendly and accommodating!  It was definitely an upbeat experience!!,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Lovely new place, we throughly enjoyed it!  The staff was so nice and the food was delicious!",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
Beautiful setting in a new resort  near the foot of the Mid-Bay Bridge. Enjoy the dock to dish seafood.  Ask for server Joni.,4,DandJ,New Orleans
"A really great experience.  Staff was very friendly and professional.  Food was excellent, but menu was somewhat limited.  Would like to see a little more variety.  Overall a nice environment for a romantic occasion.",4,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
Food was wonderful. A bit too noisy. Servers were new .,3,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"We live here and yet this is one of the most gorgeous venues we've been to down here. Highly recommend for drinks on the patio, in the Horizons bar or dinner in the restaurant!",5,OpenTable Diner,Orlando
45 minute wait with reservations but was an excellent meal,5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"Our group had a delicious dinner.  The wait staff was superb. From the moment we walked in to the end of our stay.  We were graciously greeted and our server was knowledgeable, and eager to please.  It was a magical evening.",5,OpenTable Diner,Minneapolis
The service was excellent the shrimp and grits perhaps the best of ever had!,5,OpenTable Diner,Las Vegas
"The restaurant is new and the staff is attentive clearly eager to please. They were very understanding about my companion's difficult food allergies (onion, garlic) and went out of their way to make an appetizer I ordered just for myself capable of sharing. My martini didn't come out quite right but was swiftly and adeptly rectified. Food was delicious. I'd prefer a cozier ambiance but the restaurant is very nice.",3,Jessica,New York Area
We had a great time,5,Patti,Tallahassee
"The ribeye steaks and Grouper Imperial was very tasty.   The roasted potatoes seemed old and dried out, however.  Portion size was such that I was plenty full without the potatoes.",4,MAL1953,Tallahassee
"Walked in and waited a good while to even be acknowledged.  Got seated and our waiter was very attentative.  The dining room was old and the tables were covered with paper.  I had grilled tuna, after asking about several other things on the menu that they were out of (like mashed potatoes and their soup of the day). My tuna was seasoned ok but dry.  The broccoli was over cooked and the sweet potato fries were made from frozen!   My daughter had the crab cakes and they were almost burnt, the grilled oysters were pretty good and my hubby had blackened tacos that were overly stuffed with veggies.  Just average, nothing really stood out as great.  With all the other seafood places to eat, for the price, I certainly would not go back for food.  It does however have an outside bar that I am sure in the summer is probably a happening place.  Beautiful location!",3,OpenTable Diner,Tampa
"Saturday, 4:00 - 5:30 pm, late December. Temp 65 down to 50s. Light crowd outdoors early. Plenty of seating indoors. Excellent sunset view. Waiter was excellent - experienced and humorous. Appetizers were plentiful, with something for everyone, as were the entrees. Presentation and flavors were excellent for this local establishment. I would expect much larger crowds during warmer weather.",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"Excellent food, extensive menu, good beer and wine selection, excellent staff, fantastic views, and very short wait times. A bit off the main thoroughfare, but worth coming to this little marina.",5,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
"I discovered this wonderful local venue while searching for a place to celebrate our company Christmas party.  The location was picturesque, the staff was attentive, the food was exactly as advertised and the pricing was on par.  I'd like to thank the staff for a wonderful experience and I would recommend Ernie's Dockside Oyster Bar &amp; Cafe as a good spot to host a company gathering.",5,LoGeDi,Tallahassee
Thanks for your great service and delicious food. I will definitely stop by again in the future.,5,OpenTable Diner,Houston
"The food was delicious, and the large decks overlooking the bayou and marina offer fantastic views. Loved the music and it wasn't as loud as it has been on other visits. Very enjoyable lunch.",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
My husband and I had a great meal and great service! We sat outside and watched the sunset over the water. We will be back!,5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
Lovely outside dinner with great service!,5,OpenTable Diner,Savannah
"I must say that I was pleasantly surprised!  This place has excellent food.  We had a party of 15, and they were very accommodating.   We did make a reservation on line, and had to adjust the amount of people twice.  They took care of it each time!!!   I have already recommended this place to several friends!",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
The fried catfish was delicious.  Plenty of food in my seafood combo.  Service was on the slow side but we weren't in a rush.,4,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
Food was good but needed more of it on the plate (the sides were small portions). Fried shrimp were fantastic and crab legs were good too. Desserts are fantastic!! Music coming thru speakers was too loud. Over all a good meal at better prices than on the beach but you have to figure in the $4 toll each way.,4,OpenTable Diner,Birmingham
"Enjoyable early evening casual seafood supper before attending theater. Nice view overlooking marina w/lovely sunset. Great light for a memorable photograph.  Gumbo was ""New Orleans-ish""--- very good.  Complimented a special evening w/my lovely wife. We'll go again when we're in town again. Thx for asking for my opinion.",4,RapidRobert,Tallahassee
"During our recent vacation in Destin, we stumbled upon this restaurant when we made an impromptu decision to eat out. We really wanted waterfront dining, but few places took reservations on such short notice. It was a little drive back over the sound from Destin, but man was it worth it!   We sat outside close to sunset and the view was picturesque. Our server was such a nice guy and was very attentive and accommodating. I had a key lime pie martini to start and it was like having dessert before my meal!   The crab cakes I ordered were enormous and they didn't disappoint. So fresh and good. The other 3 people I was dining with also loved their meals too.   I would recommend this place and will go back next time I am in the Panhandle!",5,JillfromOhio,Columbus
Beautiful view of the marina but horrible service and mediocre food!! The manager ended up comping our entire meal.   Will not go back...it's a shame because it's a great place to see the sunset!,1,OpenTable Diner,Nashville
Great find. Huge portions  Off the beaten path but well worth the drive.,5,Livetoeat,New Orleans
The service was terrible and the manager did little to help the situation. 3 out of 18 meals were correct and it all took over an hour for any food.,1,OpenTable Diner,Oklahoma City
We met my nephew who lives close and the food and service was great defiantly will go back.,5,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
"Food was excellent. Reservation taken, but had to sit outside, wanted inside. They ran out of some beers, ran out of cups. Desert was awesome",3,OpenTable Diner,Philadelphia
A very good dockside oyster bar.  We had a table outside on a wonderful cool evening.  Great food while watching the sun go down behind the boats tied to dock.,4,OpenTable Diner,St. Louis
"We went late &amp; they were out of a lot of stuff.   Otherwise, what we got was good &amp; the staff was nice. Just check to see they have what you want if it is later when you dine.",3,OpenTable Diner,Hawaii
"My experience started at 7 pm with the wait staff. We were seated quickly  because we had a reservation but our waitress was fairly new so we were not attended to for at least  20 min. Then,  we ordered our drinks and appetizers only to receive the drinks only which took an additional 15 to 20 min. Then we ordered our meals. So about 8:00 the meals came with the appetizers I ordered over an hour ago. So now I'm sitting here at this small table with 3 other people with no where to put my food. Some of our parties meals were cold and my food became cold because of the late appetizers being served with my meal. Although tasty I blame management for the untrained waitress who was nice but in much need of more training. I probably won't be back. But that's just me.",3,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"Found Dockside at the last minute and chose it due to high ratings. There is a beautiful view from the outside seating area but unfortunately we ate inside to avoid flies outside. Service was fine, food was average. I had the Mahi, which was dry, and my husband had the crab cake sandwich. Neither of us were overly impressed after high expectations from the reviews.",3,OpenTable Diner,Las Vegas
"We just moved to Niceville from McKinney, TX. Really happy we discovered Dockside!!",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
Average.  The best thing was the chargrilled oysters.,3,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"Server was great, but kitchen was slow and ilprepared.  Meal sides ordered (two orders of coleslaw) were unavailable because supplies were gone.  Two menu dinners were no longer available.  Orderves ordered took 45 minutes to arrive.  Meals ordered took approximately one hour to arrive.  Two meals delivered were cold and returned.  Great view of the byou...",2,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"Hostess is terrible for her position! She's losing so much business for this establishment. We were told a 30- 40 min wait, I noticed the reservation people getting seated so I made a reservation... For an hour from then. My reservation came up, I surpassed others ahead of me and they left .. so did we. 20 min AFTER the reservation!! OMG, so I never got to have the food, that looked great... But if people can't get past the front desk, Ernie is screwed!!! Ernie , you met us in the parking lot today.. you were so kind  and excited for people to come eat, I was thinking this is a great new place! An hour and half or more later... No table... No Food... And 9 people walk out. I'm so bummed. Whitney replied to my online review saying to call her and come back. We aren't looking for anything free, just really want great service. Can't come back without dealing with the hostess, and that's the problem.",1,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
Great Cajun food at very fair price.  Upstairs outside dining  overlooking the marina in the water away that's perfect atmosphere for a great seafood dinner .,5,OpenTable Diner,Orlando
"This was our first visit to Dockside and we think we would go back still despite some issues we had. First, the hostess seemed none to thrilled to be there. It took about 10 minutes to even get our drink order taken after we were seated. The view was very enjoyable outdoors on the waterfront, but it would've been nice to spend it with a tasty beverage...then when the server finally came back to take our meal orders, it took about 30 more minutes to get our food, 2 simple adult orders and 3 kids baskets. Then when our food finally came they told us it took so long because they had a large party and the kitchen was backed up. It would've been nice to have heard that about 15-20 minutes ago so I could give a snack to our very hungry 15-month old...the food was actually really good but it was difficult to enjoy after the excess wait. I feel that a party of ""150"" doesn't just show up and if they were expected then the OpenTable reservation system shouldn't have been accepting any reservations. I would hope next time we go here that our experience will be better.",3,DandGMom,Washington DC
"Always go here when in town for the hook and cook special. Enjoyed fresh trout prepared Cajun style  and as always was cooked to perfection . Along with seafood gumbo and jambalaya it was an excellent meal. Prices are very reasonable, service is great and you cannot beat the view sitting outside overlooking the marina.",5,OpenTable Diner,Orlando
We had a reservation for 9 and everything was ready when we arrived.  Group had a good time and enjoyed the meal.   Catfish was great!  Some veggies sides were a bit on the cool side.   Waiter was very good.    We would go back.,4,OpenTable Diner,Orlando
"The restaurant was wonderful; beautiful waterfront dining.  I met a nephew there and would go again anytime.  The food was delicious, prepared just right..",5,EatingOut,New England
"This was our fourth visit to Ernie's Dockside Cafe, and again, it was excellent. The food was wonderful, especially the fat baked oysters and the Redfish Algiers. It was no problem for us to split a meal and get an extra salad. Our waiter was friendly and helpful as is all the staff. They even called in the afternoon to confirm if we wanted inside or outside dining for our reservation. Looking forward to warmer weather so we can enjoy the deck!",5,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
"Great seafood and a friendly place to enjoy a nice meal.  The oysters bienville were an excellent appetizer, and the shrimp (both fried and grilled) were tremendous.  Will definitely come back for more.",5,Central75,Tallahassee
Excellent food! Service was great. We were a party of 12. Seated immediately even with a reservation. wanted to meet Chef Ernie but it was 6pm on a Friday and didn't want to bother him. Overall we were very impressed &amp; happy with our visit. Swfinatly going again. Already recommending to friends.,5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"What a fantastic time!  We had a wonderful outdoor table and were able to enjoy a beautiful sunset.  My cocktail and shrimp dish were both really good.  There were no complaints about anything at our table.  As I do not live in Niceville, it is always a treat to get to Dockside's when I am in town visiting. I look forward to the next visit",5,OpenTable Diner,Dallas
Beautiful setting and delicious meal! Highly recommended.,5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"Very nice location, food was excellent.  Tunable dip appetizer was lacking any distinct seasoning, bot the Mahi and Fish and Chips were excellent.",4,SBTB,Tallahassee
"Our waiter was new, he probably should have had more experience before being able to serve on his own. Our meal was wonderful. We were never greeted by management.",2,OpenTable Diner,Tampa
"Exceptional meal. The food was perfectly prepared and served with attention to every detail in a way reminiscent of the great Chicago chop houses of the 50’s and 60’s.  Jamison and his crew were in charge of our service and they did not disappoint. Well paced and attentive but not hovering and pushy. It was a wonderful birthday dinner and coincidentally, close to our 50th wedding anniversary.  Thank you for this great night.",5,Jnjinnc,Tallahassee
Just So-So for a $250 meal. Haven't been in a couple of years.  Not up to the standards set by other Ruth's Chris worldwide.,3,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee

"This place was top notch! Everything was so good and the atmosphere overall was incredible. My sisters and I went for my birthday and it was the best place we could’ve picked. Everything was wonderful. The food was outstanding, the service was impeccable, and they treated me really well for the occasion. I received a free dessert for my birthday and the live music came and played at my table! It was an experience! I recommend this so highly, if not for anything at least the experience. You will not be disappointed this place is literally so great and I can’t say enough about how good the food was. For sure the best steak I ever put in my mouth.",5,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco

Ceilings and seating were stained. Did not live up to our expectations of gine dining. Waiter was awkward.,3,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
"We love Ruth’s Chris steak house , you will not be disappointed. The steaks are so awesome , when they bring it to the table the steaks are sizzling . The side portions are enough for 2 people . The staff is very friendly, if you are in Destin and want a treat then go to Ruth’s Chris .",5,SandyV,New Orleans
"While we were having dinner, we watched a palmento bug crawl on the sheer curtains. We alerted our waiter, which caught it in a napkin and disposed of it. He then talked to the manager who took our drinks off our bill and gave us a free dessert to compensate us.  The manager never even came out to speak with us. The food was okay, but not fabulous. I ended up sick the next day. It was disappointing to say the least.",1,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
"My husband &amp; I were  celebrating our 29th anniversary on Sunday. We have lived in this area of Florida 28 years &amp; had never gone to the Destin Ruth's Chris, so we treated ourselves to this expirence. The ambiance was quiet , elegant &amp; romantic. We loved our meals, except my husband steak was a bit tough. I enjoyed every bite of my creamed spinach &amp; grouper dinner. I would recommend a trip here if you are able to come.",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
Anniversary dinner.,5,OpenTable Diner,New Orleans
"This was the worse visit to a Ruth’s Chris we have experienced. The valet and greeters were excellent; after being seated it went downhill. Our waiter Tara F. Should a lack of interest and attention. We waited over 15 minutes for acknowledgement and water. We waited another 15 minutes just for bread . After taking our order Tara Did not check on our table for approximately 30 minutes at which time she stopped only to advise us our food would be out soon, never asking if we needed anything additional etc. we were seated behind a large noisy party and it appears that was her attention based on a larger tip I’m sure. We frequently t Ruth’s in our hometown of Austin regularly and during travel and this is the worse restaurant visit of his caliber we have experienced. What a way to end a vacation.",3,Missy,Austin

We celebrated my husbands birthday. Our dinner was excellent.,5,OpenTable Diner,Palm Springs

"My friend is vegan (and a foodie) so we chose to go to Nix for the second time. The food is so creative and wonderfully tasty and unusual, one would have no idea that it is vegan. Every dish we've had has been delicious. The service is unobtrusive, and friendly. And while the restaurant is rather small, and our table small as well, we've not felt at all crowded but quite comfortable. Highly recommended!!",5,KAR17,New York Area

Beautiful new vegetarian restaurant with great food and service,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Really good. Lots of gluten free and vegan options. Easy to share for a table of picky eaters. Good cocktails and wine list.,5,cawillia,New York Area
"Some dishes are creative fusion and perfectly prepared - the Labneh, the inspired Cauliflower Buns. Many, though, vary from overseasoned to disappointing - broccoli with cheddar, the briny polenta. In short: already successful vegetarian dishes aren't reliable and with a few exceptions more than half of the dishes miss the mark significantly. Cocktail options are flavorful but overwrought - excepting the surprisingly genius Thyme martini.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Excellent food, service, a bit loud thought not enough to be deal breaker. Been there before, would happily return...",5,Jazmine,New York Area
The only criticism I have of this otherwise very good restaurant is that a dish can be spicy and neither the menu nor the waiter or waitress will necessarily warn you about this without your specific inquiry about the individual item. I was recently eating dinner with friends and we had made  two things  clear to our waitress: 1. we would be sharing all the food and 2. I cannot eat spicy foods. Neither the menu nor the waitress revealed to us that a cauliflower tempura we were ordering was drenched in a spicy sauce.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Excellent service to accompany exceptional food and at value-for-money prices,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

"Our vegan daughter was the reason we ate at Nix and though we might not return without her, we have nothing but praise for the variety of dishes and their wonderful flavors, the helpfulness and efficiency of the server and the ambiance.

"We are there for Thanksgiving and had an amazing tasting menu. Everything had incredible flavor and there was plenty of food to fill us up. The wine list is great and has many wines we were not familiar with, but the sommelier gave us perfect recommendations to try. Will for sure be going back.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Had Thanksgiving here and it was fabulous. The food tonight was delicious, and the service was, honestly,  better than any restaurant I've been to this year. They might have just gone all-out for Thanksgiving; I'm excited to be back for the regular menu to find out. Thanks very much, Nix.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"One of the better vegetarian restaurants (with seamless vegan accommodation) for the food, atmosphere and service. Coat check would be helpful.",4,DenPat,New York Area
"Four of us went to Nix for their Thanksgiving dinner.  We showed up early, but we were seated immediately.  In my opinion, we got the best seat in the house...directly under the skylight.  It was beautiful.  I found the waitstaff to be quick and courteous.  Everything was delicious.  Actually, there was too much food for us, so we asked to take dessert home, and Nix accommodated us easily.  The place was full, but we could easily hear each other during our conversations.  The price for the four of us was close to $400.  The meal was a fixed price.  My wife thought the drinks were too expensive.  Her little mixed drink was $14.  Overall, though, I'd go back.  Perhaps we'll return on Thanksgiving next year!",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I attended the special 4-course prix fixe Thanksgiving dinner. Overall a great meal and dining experience. Beautiful presentation, tasty dishes, plentiful food. A refreshing and creative take on traditional Thanksgiving. The only strike was that some of the food (third course) was not hot enough. I will go back for a more typical/signature meal. Always rooting for vegetarian restaurants in NYC!",4,doctor,San Francisco
so good amazing makes you happy to be vegan. Hope to return soon,5,Blairwitch,New York Area
It took them 1 hour to sit us down even though we had a reservation.,3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"A mixed review because of slow service and some disappointing dishes. Still, some of the food here is excellent, and it's a pleasure to have so many vegetarian (and vegan) choices. The dips and tandoori bread continue to be excellent. As are the cauliflower do-it-yourself buns and the rice bowl. Less successful are the artichoke and broccoli rabe sauté, as well as the gnocchi. And the service was really slow - our server went out of his way to apologize, which he had to do repeatedly - and that definitely affected our overall review.",4,EVFoodie,New York Area
Rude hostess.,1,Mencken,New York Area
"I loved the tandoor bread and the different dips as well as my amazing white chocolate matcha latte. My main meal, the fry bread, was written up online but it just didn't deliver on the same wow factor as the other items. I had the maple custard with berries for dessert and met a good friend for brunch. The atmosphere is pleasant, the decor is nice and we had a good time catching up. Our biggest complaint was probably our server though - he kept hovering and then would come back too often to follow up with us when we just needed a few minutes with our tandoor bread and drinks before selecting something from the menu. It wasn't that busy so it's not like people were waiting for our table. I also thought it was a little funny that he came and picked up our checks before we were done eating our dessert!",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Original and delicious food and healthy as well, a combination rarely found in a restaurant. We had brunch, And we will come back for more . Quality food and service and ambiance.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"We came with a large group of people and ordered about half the menu.  Everything was excellent, and everybody was very happy.  The service was terrific and attentive.",5,HappyCamper,New York Area
"Great food, chic crowd with mixed ages.  The thyme martini and playa Ii drinks were nice and my favorite dishes are the kale salad and cauliflower buns.  The tandoor bread should not be charged in my opinion.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
The variety and quality of the vegetarian/vegan options was outstanding. The service was personal and friendly. The atmosphere was warm and inviting. Wish I lived closer!,5,OpenTable Diner,Philadelphia
"Andrew and I happened to be at Dovetail last Monday for their veggie menu, which was very good, and Dovetail is a favorite restaurant anyway. But Nix is even better in the V department.   A &amp; I are neither vegans nor vegetarians, but our Chicago guests are. So we were happy to use their visit as a reason to try Nix. A COMPLETE winner. NOTHING we had was less than delicious (my least favorite was the pumpkin dish, but I don't much like pumpkin at the best of times).    Honestly though, everything we had was really fine, and our server Ania was terrific.  A &amp; I can't recommend Nix strongly enough. Whatever you order, you won't be disappointed.",5,fiji,Philadelphia
Good food.  Noise level so high that it was almost impossible to hear what your tablemate is saying.,4,jsbach,Chicago
A terrific vegetarian restaurant with interesting and well prepared dishes . The guidance of the staff on ordering is spot on and the service is most attentive. This is fine dining.,5,OpenTable Diner,Jacksonville
"The four dips(Hummus, Avocado, Red pepper and Labneh) were all awesome when paired with Tandoor bread. The Jicama ribbons had a unique texture and tasted really nice. The Cauliflower Tempura was really well made. The sauce was spicy and sweet. Pairing it with the bun really brought out the taste. The highlight of the dinner was Shittake ""cacio e pepe"". The creamy polenta and mushrooms fused to give a unique taste. The brown  rice dish was nothing unique.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"One of the best meals we've ever had. Amazing drinks- the honey bee was incredible, and the sunchoke salad and mushroom cacio e Pepe was FANTASTIC. A new favorite.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Great service from the very start! They also allowed us to seat up to at least 7 guests. The hummus is delicious and although the red pepper dip is sweet, they offer more of it in the dipping bowl.",5,LIfoodie,New York Area
I really enjoyed the Fresh Guacamole and  each of the dishes the group got.  Service was good and the drinks were strong.  Will definitely be back.,5,brock,New York Area

"Doesn't look anything like the pictures on google, but was still nice. Kind of small and upstairs lounge is very tight in regards of space. Food was good. Service was great. The drinks is too die for lol very very good.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Overall excellent dining experience. Service was impeccable from arrival to . Drinks were on point. Food didn't disappoint. I highly recommend the Budin de Pollo. Chicken Mole Enchiladas could have been better--they were a bit dry. Overall, though, excellent dinner spot. Beautiful interior design, with a great attention to detail.",5,thehungryhippo,New York Area
"Living near the new Rosa Mexicano I was looking forward to trying it.  However, it was a disappointment. The restaurant is dark, with no candles or lighting on or near the tables. Even the young diners were pulling out iPhone flashlights just to read the tiny print on the menus in the dark.  After ordering and waiting quite a while we were told that they were out of the fish special for the night...it was only 9pm.  The guac at RM is always good but not made at the table at this outlet, unlike the others. The main courses were unremarkable. The noise level was very high. It really feels and looks like a bar with some tables for food. Cannot recommend it and would not bring guests there.  I would advise the owners to place nice candles at each table, increase the font on the menus, put in some noise canceling materials, make the guac at the table and make sure there is enough of the specials.",2,JMOT225,New York Area
"I've been to the Rosa at Lincoln Center (a lot)and Union Square, and when I happened to be downtown near Chambers street at lunch time, I gave this a try. It is a very small storefront, and upon entering, I was taken aback by the beautiful decor and the hospitality of the staff. Apparently they have just recently opened. The menu is a little different. The guacamole was great( not made table side but who cares?), signature margarita hit the spot, and steak tacos were pre assembled, and had a nice amount of heat and smokiness. The bar looks like a place I'd go on a Fridayafter work, and I'm sure it will get a lot of customers. Try it if you are in the area!",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Seriously give this place a try, great food, great service, great atmosphere",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Too many kids crying- not that the restaurant can really help that... No chips and salsa at the table unless you spring for the $15 guacamole.  Service was pathetic. I guess only bussers can clear the table?  No plates were distributed for our shared appetizer.. Food was uninspiring , and I think sat for some time under a heat lamp before being brought to the table.  All in all a disappointment. Especially after having good meals at the Lincoln Center location...",2,Ruby,New York Area
"Since we love the restaurant at Lincoln Center we decided to try to one on Tribeca and got  very disappointed.  The menu is different (less varied), for example you don't have the option to make your own tacos.  The guacamole isn't done by the table and the corn chips weren't warm.  Overall the dishes are nothing special and smaller.",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The food was absolutely delicious and the service was phenomenal. Unfortunately, the restaurant was so incredibly hot that we rushed through our meal and left earlier than we would have if it had been more comfortable in there! Would definitely go back to try again since the food, drink and people were so great.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Quiet for Saturday brunch, and while the restaurant is in a long, closed in room, oddly with no windows, the food was very good, and very big portions.",4,pmmnyc,New York Area
"Very authentic Mexican food! Agua de Jamaica was outstanding, the service was super, the atmosphere was exceptional, it was just an overall great place!",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"We tried Rosa Mexicano for the first time, and were not disappointed. The freshly-prepared guacamole was superb, followed by Pollo Adobado which was cooked to perfection. The portions are very generous and the service attentive. The only negative is the place lacks any ambiance; it is too dimly lit (for lunch, at least), and the seating arrangements in both sections are sub-optimal.",5,TheLocalTourist,New York Area
"There are many exceptional restaurants to choose from in Tribeca, but I am sure few pay as much attention to their customers as this one. They make sure you are having a great meal experience. The food is consistently good too and they have a nice variety of drinks.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Great food and drink. Good atmosphere for a group.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Friendly service, cool ambience and atmosphere and good Mexican food and drinks, can't go wrong. Not exactly a destination but if the area and looking for a good restaurant serving up Mexican cuisine, believe you won't be disappointed.",3,ExploringNYCcuisine,New York Area
"I've been to several other Rosa Mexicano locations, each better (some much better) than this one.  The food was very disappointing.  The main dining room was quite dark and not particularly inviting for a business lunch.  Although we arrived early for lunch, and there were few other tables seated, the wait for the appetizer was very long.  I believe it's a new restaurant, perhaps they are still training the kitchen staff as well as the front of house?  I'll wait for a long while before I return, to give them a chance to get it together.",2,Jim10011,New York Area
"Nice atmosphere and kid friendly.  Wait staff was good.  Friendly environment, low key but nice. The Guac is very good but the entres were just so - so, not offensive or bad just nothing memorable.   My memory of the one at Lincoln Center was better than the Tribeca location.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
The food quality is not even close to the other Rosa Mexicano,2,Geise,New York Area
"Our family of five has always enjoyed the Rosa Mexicano restaurants uptown but since we had plans downtown we decided to try this newer location.  Everything about our visit was perfect.  We have found the food to be consistently enjoyable at the other  spots but, I dare say this was the best we've had to date.  The fresh guacamole, the frozen Margaritas and all of our entrees were prepared with care and served very hot.  I really liked the updated decor style here too.  Lastly, the service in particular was absolutely outstanding!  Chris C., our server, was such a nice, attentive and positive person that we hope to see him there again soon.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Outstanding! I took my girlfriend out to Rosa Mexicano for her birthday, which we have been to several times. Since my hotel was in soho I decided to try the TriBeCa location instead of our usual -Lincoln center.  It appeared that the restaurant was connected to some other restaurant or lounge which seemed very chill. We lucked out with a earlier reservation (6pm) and it was quiet enough to hear myself think. The service was exceptional - water was replaced as needed - we were offered additional chips / tortilla - according to my girlfriend the drinks were strong but very good. As we got closer to the end of our meal it was starting to get busy but that didn't effect our service at all, in fact we were practically being waited on hand and foot by the entire staff!! I ordered the skirt steak which was great - and the guacamole was better than their other locations ( guac to go please?)  And a real bonus was that I found street parking on the same block  - which was a total plus.    This is a great spot and a wonderful addition to the ROsa Mexicano line.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"My chicken was dry.  My co-worker and I were on business travel and for expense purposes needed separate checks, waiter refused.",3,OpenTable Diner,Cleveland
"My husband and I have always gone to Rosa at Union Square, but we decided to try the Tribeca location.  It is a LOT smaller than the other places, and has different decor, but Wow was the food exquisite and the service was impeccable!  From the moment we arrived, to the hostess, to the servers, bar guys, even the guys clearing the plates, everyone had top service on their mind.  It was really refreshing and made you feel so welcomed!  The Tablone was AMAZING, I recommend, and the Ceviche was delicious!!  We will be going back again and again!",5,CaressaandDavid,New York Area
"Never understood why this place is popular. My husband and I only go when someone else has made reservations there. The food is not impressive, the Lincoln Center location is very tacky looking and very noisy. Are these tourists, or New Yorkers? Can't figure it out, but there are much better Mexican food places in Manhattan. On top of being not good, it's also over-priced.",2,GirlNYC,New York Area
"Tourist trap--ugly design--really bad ""Tex/Mex""--Not at all like uptown version",2,ses716,New York Area
"Guacamole is legendary for a reason.  Don't know where they get their avocados or what they do to it, but it is unmatched.  Also loved the sangria, which is less sweet and more cinnamon-y than usual.  The food was reliably yummy, although I do remember my previous visit (at a different branch) to be more swoonworthy -- maybe we just didn't order adventurously (lots of enchiladas).  Very friendly service, lovely place.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Delicious and best Mexican food ever!!! Very considerate to vegetarians ...,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Have really enjoyed previous incarnations of Rosa M., esp the original on UES. But this one is a cheat. Margaritas are made with only a vapor of tequila (if that), choosing from the list of magaritas is absurd as choices are not respected in second rounds but who cares since none is added to the sweetened juice anyway. The waiter treated us and the table as if we and our dinner were duffle bags at JFK. Its not like it was crowded. Expensive faux meals. The guacamole was good. Go elsewhere.",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
The food is just as expected from Rosa mexicano. I went on the last day of restaurant week Feb 5 @9. The table was ready didn't have to wait but the service was terrible. Waiter kept by passing us only came once to ask for all of our 3 course   options from the prefix menu . He mixed our orders expected since he didn't write them down. When it came to dessert I wanted to order the ice cream that was not on the prefix menu. Reminded me it was not there but told him I pay for it. Then we asked for tea he answered rudely they don't have any... Really? This place is just unprepared.,3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
The food was outstanding. I can't say enough about it but the service was pretty much non-existent. The waiter took our order and it was the last time I saw him until the check came. The entrees were dropped off without asking us if we needed anything else. I would have liked some hot sauce but didn't have the chance to ask for it. We were never asked if everything was alright or even if I wanted another drink.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Loved It! ....alittle small, but overall the food and service made up for it.",4,TammyY,New York Area
If you want True flavors this place is a unique representation of  Mexican food...The cocktails are always great and a classic Margarita gits the spot can't beat better than anything I tasted!,4,Trish,New York Area
"Even though I requested a more private table, I was denied several empty available booths. The service factor here was lacking and not enough effort was made or attempted to please the customer or honor a reservation request.",1,RoseannC,New York Area
Small location but great atmosphere. Food is on point like all the other locations.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"We had such a great night! We were celebrating our anniversary, and the staff really took care of us. The hostest acknowledged it, our server acknowledged it, the kitchen sent us mid-course dishes, and the bar sent us drinks. We really felt special.  We've been together 10 years...got engaged after lunch at Rosa Mexicano, and celebrate several special occassions there. They make us feel like family.",5,Jamie,New York Area
Ate there for restaurant week. Served regular sized portions for their special menu which was nice. Food was outstanding.,5,ficktyt,New York Area
Very nice dinner at Rosa as always. Service was slow however it was understandable because it was very busy. Manager compensated by buying us a round of drinks + dessert.,4,OpenTable Diner,Philadelphia
"I have been a frequent customer of Rosa Mexicano at their various locations throughout New York City for a number of years. I have never had a disappointing experience at any of them. As a result, when I recently found out that a new location was planned for my own neighborhood, I was extremely excited.  My first visit to the new location was shortly after they opened (it might have even been opening week). The experience was pleasant, as always. We were even treated to a few samples of their food/drink offerings, on the house. Service was excellent, and the food, as usual, was awesome. I also like the physical aspects of this new location more than the others in New York City. It's significantly smaller, and as a result, feels a lot more intimate, which I appreciate, as I'm typically here for date-night.  My second visit to this location was just as lovely as the first. This time around, we were celebrating my birthday. We had our normal meal, which was then followed by a delicious tres leches cake (complete with a candle and everything!), and a Polaroid-style photo to commemorate the occasion. It was a low-key way to celebrate my birthday, and I absolutely loved it!  I've heard from others that they have had issues with the level of service at this Rosa Mexicano location, but I have not observed this first-hand. Although, based on my two visits (so far!), I could see how the quality of the service could vary, based on the shift manager on-duty at the time. There is some room for improvement in the level of attention paid to tables around the time when main course orders would be placed. During both of my visits, I have had to go out of my way to flag down our server to place our order.",5,thehungryhippo,New York Area
I frequent the locaion on 18th St.  and have to say that location is a better place.  The Guacamole as always was delicious but the drinks we so-so.  The sangria gets a thumbs down.,3,Hungry4carmines,New York Area
"Having eaten at various Rosa Mexicano locations previously, we were excited for the new TriBeCa outpost. Unfortunately it wasn't that exciting of an experience. The food was mediocre- not as exciting as we remembered from other locations but certainly not offensive. The prices were in line with expectations. The service was slow and inattentive. The ambiance was bland- having been to the restaurant that was in this location before RM moved in, it is clear RM did little to make this their own space. All in all, I see no reason to go back to this RM considering El Vez and Anejo are nearby, similarly priced, and an overall better experience. RM needs to up its game if it is going to do well in TriBeCa.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Have eaten and most other of Rosa's locations and this one did not disappoint.  Relatively small (which is nice), nice ambiance, and great food and service.  The carnitas were delicious and as always the freshly made guacamole did not disappoint.",4,OpenTable Diner,Washington DC
"Overall, the food and ambiance was amazing. For the location only being open a month, everything was great. Only part about the experience of going to RM is to have the Guacamole being made fresh in front of you. I missed that part of it at this location and SANGRIAs. Please bring the Sangrias over here.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"We have enjoyed the location on the upper west side. This was very different. More corporate restaurant than local place. Food was meh, and overly salty. Menu designed to make money. Missing a love of food.",3,Blevins,New York Area
"Tasty food, excellent skirt steak. Guacamole appetizer and chips could be larger but overall excellent! Waiter was extremely courteous and helpful.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"This is a small restaurant, so not a lot of energy or vibe.   They did not make the guacamole table side either.   Standard menu, out of a few items and no seasonal specials.  Since the chain has been around for quite awhile, it would be nice to see some new additions or specials from time to time.   Tribeca still lacks a really, really good mexican restaurant.",4,Woodmom,New York Area
Food was OK. Margarita was not good. It was weak (but price was expensive side.) I couldn't find any reasons why we want to come this place over El Vez or Anejo.....,3,Udonsan,New England
Where once this place could be considered a reliable stalwart; its not just simply a wart on the food scene. Ordinary run of the mill Mexican in a field of better places like El Vez,2,Lml4400,New York Area
What a fabulous restaurant. The decor was amazing. The food was delicious. The service was excellent. Britton served us and he was amazing.,5,Sams,New Orleans
"There were elements on each plate that were delicious, however the overall dishes/plates were closer to average. I would skip dessert, given they couldn't even serve the apple tart with ice cream (the tart wasn't that great).",4,OpenTable Diner,Kansas City
"After reading other reviews and the article in Coastal Living we were looking forward to this New Year's Day meal - but the restaurant definitely did not live up to the hype and advertisement.  First - the service was the only saving grace of the entire evening.  The staff was attentive, efficient, and very polite.  It is all downhill from here - worse oysters we have ever tasted in Destin.   The ""Chef's Catch of the Day"" was sushi - really, at a Gulf Coast restaurant you have sushi as your chef's daily special - embarrassing.  Very limited menu selections and the prices say Five Star - but the food was no where near the that level, best case two stars.  Unfortunately I do not see us dining here again and cannot recommend it to anyone.",2,JohnW,Nashville
The food and service were excellent. A great place for special occasions and when you wish to say- thank you!,5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"Christmas night was not a good evening for dining at primrose. The service was slow. Only had one waitress who seemed to care.  Cold food, did not know it was going to be served family style. They definitely need to get the Kinks out since they are new.",1,OpenTable Diner,Birmingham
"Our dinner was excellent. So happy we went back for Sunday brunch. The cauliflower appetizer was so good, we ordered it on Sunday morning!",5,SarainAL,Atlanta
"$48 steak was overcooked. Ordered medium rare served medium. Sushi was very good. The dessert was very good. Wines were more than double priced, therefore, three or four times the retail price   Normally 2 to 2 1/2 times the retail price, is the normal. The bar has lots of atmosphere. The dining room is more like a grill, little to no atmosphere. Dining experience left quite a bit to be desired for a $250 dinner for two.",2,OpenTable Diner,New Orleans
Stunning location and decor!....Five star sushi!,5,OpenTable Diner,Oklahoma City
"This is the restaurant in the newly built expansion of the Henderson Inn. The hotel and restaurant decor was fantastic, really beautifully done. The food is pricey but excellent. They have a sushi bar within the restaurant with some unusual specials, the sushi chef came out to talk to us about the moonfish special we had ordered, which was tasty. He used to work in the Osaka restaurant in Destin and clearly knows his stuff.   Our favorite appetizer was the baked oysters. My wife had the snapper and I had the filet mignon, I think we both agreed the steak was better and the fish was a little plain, but we certainly enjoyed them. I'd definitely go back. They will be a contender for the best restaurant in Destin.",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
New resort in Destin. We are locals. Fantastic view and very well appointed reset. Restaurant well done. The food and service were exceptional for a two week old venue.  We will be back. Food was excellent. Great wine selection.,5,OpenTable Diner,Las Vegas
"i would've liked to say this place was great for happy hour. but happy hour is only at the bar.  i came for happy hour with a few people and sitting at a bar eating and drinking isn't ideal in a group setting. so we got a table. and thats when we learned happy hour was reserved for the 20-foot counter space only. i muscled the courage to go to the bar and order a happy hour drink......and then bring it back to the table. which was frowned upon. unfortunately. but i guess understandably? they let it slide. ...considering i had already paid and said i didn't know i couldn't bring it back to the table. so if you don't want those ""looks"", don't do what i did.  anyway. decor was nice. i do not have hispanic or latin heritage (i apologize if i didn't use that in the correct manner), but i felt the music and lighting gave off that nice ambient environment. tacos. was. delicious. i ordered 2 servings for myself. yes i eat a lot. the corn that came with it.....is....unbelievable. we could not stop talking about how good the corn was. i mean, you're in good company with good drinks, and you can't stop talking about how good the corn is. whats that say about the corn? or how bad the company is? but yes, i finished the corn too. two servings of it. its just so good. ..i want to go back now just to eat the corn. i need to diet.",3,Andy,New York Area
Service was excellent and really great food!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Great bartender &amp; waiter.,4,Newfood,New York Area
Service was very slow for lunch time - 1-1/2 hours for lunch is too long.  It was restaurant week and I ordered from that menu and it was very good.  My husband ordered the cobb salad and said it was ordinary.,3,Shazza,New York Area
"The day I went it was too hot, and we were probably sat in the hottest area of the restaurant. I went for ny restaurant week hoping to get a good deal, but everything seemed overpriced. The margaritas were the best and somewhat worth the price but everything else lacked.  I have been to the other Rosa Mexicano by the opera and it was a little better experience. Maybe it was just a bad shift, or the excessive heat that made things bad that day.",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Service is really, really slow, and food is decent, but didn't stand out in any way.",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Enjoyed it a lot. A great addition to the neighborhood.,5,Noopty,London
A fun time but loud and very hot upstairs in the back area we opted to sit downstairs instead,4,Event4u,New York Area
"food was just okay. I have been other locations and have had a way better experience, you can tell it was a new location. The staff was not that attentive.... not personable. The hostess kept sitting family with kids next to us, normally we wouldn't mind if we were with our kids but since it was just us the two of us I feel she could have known better since there were plenty other places to be seated.",3,maryjaiden,New York Area
Service was terrible. We ordered quickly and was still a 2 1/2 hour long dinner. Our waitress disappeared and we had to ask about our food order.,2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Terrible food, service and expensive. One dinner came after everyone was half done. Lincoln center and union square Rosas rock",1,SherylT,New York Area
Waited over 15 mins for waitress to come over to take our orders. Never gave the check after clearing table. The hostess had to give it to us and run if. Waitress never came back.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Rosa Mexicano is pretty reliable in terms of food and experience. Great guac and fresh homemade tortillas. My dinner recently was marred slightly by what seemed to be a lack of air conditioning, or perhaps just really weak air conditioning. They had floor fans everywhere, which I guess considering the situation was thoughtful, but it is hard to feel like you are out at a nice restaurant when a floor fan is blowing on you.",3,Merry,New York Area
Overall the food was really great.  The waiter we had was the only downside. When I asked for a drink without agave (a form of sugar) he was noticeably agitated and the rest of the night was very slow with our table.  Food took a long time but it was very good.  I definitely would go back just hopefully a better waiter.,4,kattyr3,New York Area
"Usually I go to the Union Square location which is very noisy and festive. This was more low key (a small birthday dinner where one of the guests of honor was senior) and what we needed for this particular night. The service was quick, our server was great and everyone loved the food. The Guac, as always, was super fresh.   The drinks were Ok although one in the party thought the Hibiscus mojito tasted like medicine, our server kindly replaced it with a regular mojito. I wasn't impressed with my Mango Chile -- basically a mango margarita but the Frozen Pomegranate lived up to the hype -- a great drink.   Due to food allergies we brought our own cupcakes to celebrate. The restaurant brought candles and dessert plates to the table and we ordered (very good) coffee. Being accommodated in this way was much appreciated. I'll definitely be back to this location.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Great food great drinks great service!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Great service and food, but the noise level was too high. Not great for intimate dinners or conversation.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"we really like Rosa Mexicano and have been going for years to the midtown  restaurant. In the last few years to the Lincoln Center branch, which is the most glamorous. The Tribeca restaurant is the newest one and should do well. Excellent guacamole !",3,Rosequartz7,New York Area
"The food was tasty but the service was very slow. Our waitress basically ignored us. We waited 20 min for drinks, then 15 min for guacamole, then another 30 min for the entree. If you want to spend 1.5 to 2hrs for dinner---go to Rosa Mexicano/ TriBeCa.",3,TriBeCaGirl155,New York Area
Service was lack luster. I purchased a gilt voucher for $89 for this restaurant. Additionally I spent $90 more. They still treated me like I was getting a free meal. We had bottomless guacamole and I had to ask 10 times for over an hour for our SECOND bowl. I could see if I asked for countless bowls. This was our second ask. Good was ok but the service was just bad. Don't come here with a gilt voucher unless you want to be treated like a second class citizen!,3,lrivera13,Washington DC
"This location keeps missing!  Generally, I really like Rosa Mexicano and was excited when one opened in Tribeca.  However, this location really does not have it together and the service is always spotty and really weird.  Also, its a hassle to get a booth, even at 5:30 when the restaurant is empty.  They've even tried to seat us in the back room when the restaurant is empty.  So, the expereince starts out bad before you even get to your table and then it goes from bad to worse with the server.  The food, however, generally is the same as at the other locations, except that the last time we went, the chef burned the plantains and the carnitas.  The food was so burned that I couldn't even believe they brought it out to us!  I'd rather make to trek to another location than keep delaing with the nonsense at this location.",2,Chuck,New York Area
"I found the restaurant to be much quieter than the Rosa Mexicano in Columbus Circle, but the food and the service was great.  However we did go on an off-time, and maybe that is why it was so quiet. Still a great restaurant!",5,MaryM,New York Area
"Compared to the two other restaurants I've been to (18th street, Lincoln Center), this one had the most mediocre appearance and ambiance. I was surprised to enter a very lack luster looking Rosa Mexicano in Tribeca, of all neighborhoods. Service and food was great..but I wouldn't go back there.",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Mango-chili margeritas are excellent!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Great service and food.  Booth design is to low for the tables. Felt like I needed a booster seat. Excellent drinks and wonderful fresh guacamole.,4,AndrewZ,New York Area
"Good food, what you'd expect from a Rosa Mexicano or more generally from a mexican restaurant where the entree averages $25.  Drinks were even better than the food and worth the NYC price tag - recommend the frozen pomegranate or the margarita.    Unfortunately the food and drink were outdone by the poor service.  The wait staff was unattentive, took forever to take our drink order, and generally did not seem enthused or motivated to create an enjoyable dining atmosphere or experience.  We had to flag someone down multiple times to take our order or answer our questions.",3,ManojV,Philadelphia
"We've been here 2 times, both on  Friday night around 9 pm. While the food is great for the most part, the atmosphere is kind of sad. We had the queso (the only one I don't recommend as it was basically a melted blob of cheese, not a actual dip). The shrimp quesedillas are fantastic as were the carnitas (tacos) and the churros. The drinks are decent (margaritas and paloma) but I highly recommend avoiding the Mezcal and tonic which tasted like someone poured liquid smoke in it. Overall I would return but I don't feel like they'll be around in that location much longer due to the lack of patrons.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Gourmet Mexican food is tricky as it often involves the same old dishes just dressed up a bit. This is what I found here. Nothing bad really aside from some chicken breast dried up on a grill. Otherwise, I probably could have gotten by for about half what I paid here with essentially the same food elsewhere.",3,Brooklynreviewer,New York Area
"My wife and I are generally fans of Rosa Mexicano and have been to their location near Columbus Circle. We live downtown, however, and we're very excited to Rosa Mexicano was opening in TriBeCa. We were also pleased to find a deal for the new location on Gilt City, which was presumably a way to advertise the opening of the new location.   First, the positives. The new location is smartly laid out, capturing the intimate, downtown vibe. The cocktails and food are typical Rosa Mexicano: excellent. Our lamb tacos were a bit too intense on the spice and salsa, but I that probably has more to do with our palate than the dish. The empanadas, quesadillas and churros were delightful.  Unfortunately, the service was not in line with what we've come to expect from Rosa Mexicano. Upon hearing that we had a deal through Gilt, our waitress turned from friendly to frosty and it seemed like she couldn't be bothered every time we interacted with her. Ordinarily we would chalk this up to her having a tough evening, but she seemed very friendly with her larger tables who did not seem to have the Gilt voucher. The rest of the wait staff, including the manager, were very friendly but our waitress seemed to take issue with the Gilt voucher.   It is very disappointing that an employee would pass up an opportunity to make a good impression on a first visit and so cavalierly give up on the possibility of repeat business. Rosa Mexicano is hardly the only game in town with respect to TriBeCa and while the food is very tasty, the service leaves us inclined to stick with our old favorites, particularly as parents of a young daughter who have to make arrangements in order to have a night out once or twice per month.   We would suggest to all restaurateurs to instruct their staff on the strategic business reasons for advertising through Gilt and the importance of making a good first impression with customers.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"My wife and I enjoyed the guacamole and margaritas which provided a great entry into the 3 course shared meal. The food was excellent with more than adequate portions. The restaurant was lively, but not loud. Downstairs is a great cozy bar/lounge area which is more intimate than the restaurant upstairs. I have no reservations  about recommending this restaurant to anyone looking for a great night out.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The quality of the entrees was quite disappointing. There seemed to have been little attention paid to their preparation and the results were boring. The drinks were more creative and better prepared.  The bill was unexpectedly high, especially given the inferior quality of the food.",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Another Rosa Mexicano is always welcome.  This new addition has a smaller menu but all the items on it match their counterparts uptown.  The food is delicious and the service accommodating.  They do not have the space to make the guacamole at your table but it is first rate.  The venue is different, smaller, without the feel of a Mexican festival.  They have a beautiful bar.  Good moderately priced restaurants are needed in this are and Rosa Mexicano helps fill that need.",4,Rocky,New York Area
We have been to all NY brunches of Rosa Mexicano but this is the top as of now. The dishes tasted different from others.  Flautas had better sauce. Pollo Adobado was very tasty.  I love the side order of Mexican Corn.  Of course Margaritas were excellent!  I wish I could make it to the dessert.  Next time. The service was great.  Only Cons were the place is very small so it's better to make a reservation and ithe room was a bit noisy even before the restaurant was half full. But I am happy to have anothe good addition in Down Town.,5,Cuquet,New York Area
And the best frozen pomegranate margarita ever ever ever,5,Samaya68,Bristol
Food and ambeince was good but they didnt have vegetarian menu available at this location. Vegetarian menu is availble at their other locations.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Terrible can't even summarize,1,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"went for the occasion. Little to no celebratory atmosphere.  Limited menu, overcrowded. If there was music it could not be heard.  Was informed that Mariachi bands do not play at any of the NYC restaurants. A few mardi gras beads and cheap plastic castanets were  on the tables.",2,OpenTable Diner,London
We were here for Cinco de Mayo. The service and food were excellent. Whets great time.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Needs to have the same options as others,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Horrible service. Marco our waiter couldn't be more rude and arrogant. When we asked for something, we had to ask more then once and when we asked, we seemed to be annoying him. He never even came to check how our entrees were and he screwed up the check. Table next to us had the same experience. Luckily the food was pretty good. I'll never return to this location. I'll stick with Lincoln Center location or Dos Caminos.",3,914FoodConnoisseur,New York Area
"We have eaten at several Ruth's Chris Steak House's around the country and until we dined at the Destin location, our favorite was downtown Chicago. Ruth's Chris Destin was fabulous!

The atomsphere was very welcome. The inside Decor was breath taking. The food was absolutly speechless. I had the steak with a bleu cheese crust. It was amazing to sum it up. The price was resonable and will worth the quality and quanitiy of the food you receive.

Thanks RuthChris staff in Destin for such a loving evening. SLBP of Pensacola, Fl",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"I have to say that the calamari there is absolutely the best calamari I've eaten. The salad was outstanding as well.  As for the steak, I may have expected too much. The steak was simply mediocre. It was not as flavorful as I had expected, and it was very fatty. My husband and I both got the ribeye at the advice of our waiter. I wanted to get the filet, but he recommended this steak. waiter FAIL! Also, our waiter was not as attentive as I expected. Mistakes were made, but we rolled with it.  Also, it bears mentioning that you HAVE to use the valet parking. I'm not a fan of this, especially since the parking lot is literally ten steps from the front door. On a solid note, the ambiance, salad and appetizer was outstanding.",3,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee

"the experience was quite good for a special occasion, but this restaurant is definitely reserved for that type of evening. the food is fantastic and the service is great, however; with some practice you would be able to recreate much of the menu on your own. this would be much more impressive for your date and much, MUCH easier on your wallet.",4,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
HORRIBLE!VERY DISSAPOINTED!I made special reservations@ Ruth's Chris Destin to suprise my husband who was returning from Iraq.We have eaten@ Ruth's Chris in Memphis TN several times and loved it.Destin is nothing like it! Do not expect anything like most Ruth's Chris you've been to.There were several people dining in bathing suites tank tops and flip flops...granted it is the beach but we did not expect to sit beside a table full of loud 15 year olds while trying to enjoy what should have been a classy romantic dinner.We had planned to spend a quite romantic diiner away from the loud seafood house's.We intended on spending quite a bit of money an did not.The crab trap was a much nicer resturant and you guys advertise as fine dining??UPSET!!,1,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"The atmosphere and surroundings were great. The steaks were very dry and charred around the edges. We were all (party of 8) disappointed. The bread pudding was cold in the middle and the rum sauce was cold as well.  I've been to many Ruth's Chris restaurants and always enjoy them. However, this is my third time to dine at this particular location and it has never measured up to the others.",3,OpenTable Diner,Houston

"Overall the food was good &amp; the service was good. I took my husband there for Father's Day. Even though I was paying, he thought the place was expensive &amp; ordered chicken &amp; made the children order chicken or shrimp.  I, on the other hand, had a DELICIOUS ribeye with crabmeat on top. We had mashed potatoes &amp; creamed spinach for our sides. I'm on a no carb diet so I didn't get to taste the potatoes &amp; I wasn't a big fan of the spinach either.  Overall it was a nice experience.",4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
We were there to celebrate my birthday and were disappointed with the way our food was prepared. My lamb chops were burned instead of medium rare and my wifes steak was over cooked as well. The waiter never came back to ask how things were. It was not the usual Ruth Chris meal. We have dined at rurh Chris all over the USA and this was the worst.,2,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"We went to Ruth's Chris to celebrate my husbands 30th birhtday. We were looking forward to the experience based on many reviews that we had heard about it. Well, we were sorely dissapointed! The service and ambiance were great but the food left something to be desired. Not only that but the they didn't have half of the dessert list available and my husband was really looking forward to cheesecake! All in all it was a good one time experience but I doubt we will ever go again. For what we paid I expeced to fall off my chair when I tasted the steak; instead we fell off when we got the bill! Expected, but still a shock after what we had eaten.",3,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
Ruth Chris is always a safe bet when traveling!,4,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"Two of the three in the party loved the food; however, I ordered the Stuffed Chicken Breasts and did not enjoy. The menu did not state that the breasts had bones and I typically do not order meat on the bone. I have dined with Ruth's Chris many times and always enjoyed the steaks so I should have stayed with my first choice.",4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Ruth's Chris is usually a pretty safe bet, and this Destin location does not disappoint. I have been to this RC three times, and the food and service have been consistently excellent. What makes this one unique is that it is quite kid friendly. Being in Destin, they probably get many more families on vacation instead of RC's usual business crowd. They have small video players available with lots of Disney-type DVDs which can really make for happy kids and parents. And the kid's menu serves up a great 4 ounce steak instead of the dreary junk most restaurants offer. In comparison, Fleming's in Destin was also very good, but RC probably has a slight leg up on them from both food and service.",5,ldgrmnmc,Birmingham
Everything was great. The only thing that made me a little mad was the valet service had both parking lots in front of the restaurant. So if you don't trust a valet service you have to park a distance away.,5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee

"I have found the food at Ruths Chris consistant from Hong Kong to Destin but what makes the Memphis location stand out above all other restaurants in the city is the staff.  Everyone from Kevin the GM, Julie in the bar to Quentin of the wait staff, all go the extra mile to make you feel at home.  This is my favorite restaurant to bring customers or to have a romantic dinner.  Keep on doing the things you do guys....its great!",5,OpenTable Diner,Memphis
"Horrible service. Over priced for the food and service. Called for a waiter, she  looked at me and turned right back around ignoring me completely.. horrible. Food took 40 min to get to the table. I ordered my guacamole spicy and the waiter admitted that he made it mild!! Realllyyy?!? He needed to remake it. Def won’t visit them again!",2,OpenTable Diner,Orlando
It was very nice to have a space in the back room that was quiet and which to celebrate with a group of people. The wait staff was lovely and accommodating and the food was terrific.,5,bt10011,New York Area
This Rosa Mexicana was quite a let down. It’s located in a beautiful space but offers mediocre service and food at best.  Points of contention: * we had to request a glass of water. * we had to request a second round of drinks. * we had to request the side dishes we ordered a second time. * the entrees came out spicey and smothered in sauce after a request to be mild and served on the side.  * we were told verbatim: “That’s the way it is in Mexican food” Overall it was a disappointing service  experience and one that is likely to deter  other visits.,3,Raymond1,New York Area
Loved the place!  Food was great. Server a little slow with the drinks.,5,jjsk,Orlando
"I reserved a booth as I needed it for a business dinner. They said all of the empty booths were reserved for a party larger than 2 and we were put up the stairs in a noisy, crowded, small 2-top. VERY disappointing.",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
i’ve been here every day since we had this reservation. BEST MEXICAN IN NEW YORK!!!! BEST MARGARITAS EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5,OpenTable Diner,Los Angeles
"Brought food out with appetizers, about 3 minutes after we ordered. Didn’t even have drinks yet.  Way too quick!!  Need to work on pacing of the meal.",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Only had the guac.  Fresh but more chunky than I'm used to.   Chips and salsa were good.  Expensive drinks.,3,Veggielover,New York Area
Waitress was phenomenal a little pricey for Mexican but the food was excellent,5,OpenTable Diner,Miami
I love this location especially since it is so close to my job. My only complaint is that I feel like evertytime I go there they change the way an item looks on the menu. The nachos is much smaller now...the pomegranate margarita is made differently.  They used to give you three dips with the chips now it is only one.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"We had a nice time.  Quick bite before seeing a show.  Waitress was great, very attentive.  Great drinks - guac is always delicious!  Highly recommend that!  Hostess was not so welcoming and attempted to put us at a small table upon my arrival.  When I inquired about a booth seating bc it was our date night she gave me resistance stating it was for a reservation 90 minutes from the time we arrived.  There were plenty of booths available at the time (3 in fact) and upon us leaving after dinner there were about four booths empty.",4,OpenTable Diner,Miami
"Awesome food, awesome service and friendly environment. Really enjoyed the food and the drinks. We will be back",5,NYCfoodie,New York Area
Our server was the absolute best and for that alone the experience was so much better:) food is always on point,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Everytime I go to Rosa I am very satisfied with their food and service. I love to come here on lunch for my little get away from the hustle and bustle around my job. They also have a great happy hour and their Michelada's are AMAZZZ! Highly recommended.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Excellent Carnitas and Margaritas.  We ate there thee times during our Week long visit to New York.,5,Stormkaap,Sacramento
terrible guac and rubbery chicken.  hard to believe the guac had more tomatoes than avocado and had no salt. And took more than 20 minutes to arrive.,1,bethh,Miami
Kristen the manager is wonderful!  Makes you feel at home.,5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"Very uninspiring food. We asked for medium hot guacamole, got hot instead. Caesar Chicken Salad wad limp. No one there when we sat down, but had to flag waiter down to order our lunches.",2,BenNearSeattle,Seattle
"After visiting the Observatory at One World Trade Center, we took our 9 year old granddaughter here for her birthday dinner. The reservation was made through Open Table and I noted that it was a special occasion. I requested that they put a candle in whatever dessert our granddaughter ordered, if possible. The birthday was never mentioned to the waitress when we got there, yet at the end if the meal she brought a big piece of tres leches cake to the table, offered a Mexican sombrero to Bridget, and sang with us!  There was no charge for the cake, which was enough for the three of us, and it was delicious!  All our meals were very good. We chose Rosa Mexicano because Mexican is my granddaughters favorite and it was walking distance from the Freedom Tower.  My husband and I are relative ""newbies"" to Mexican cuisine; however, the waitress was excellent at guiding us through the menu and helping us choose our meals.  Good food and a fun evening!",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Seated right away, wonderful ambiance. All staff were courteous. The food was delicious from start to finish! Our new favorite place in the city.",5,OpenTable Diner,Hawaii
space is a little tight but what isn't in Tribeca. Service was wonderful and the dishes were filling.,4,Queen67,New York Area

excellent food. service was good. reservation was easy to get.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Excellent service and food. The Restaurant is conducive for talking and enjoying an excellent meal. A great neighborhood restaurant,5,Fresser,New York Area
"Was told to wait 15 minutes in the bar, after 45 minutes we asked if we could get our table.. got a table downstairs. Supercold with the AC. Nice hostess told us we would get something on the house (didn't happen). Wasnt that hungry anymore when food arrive, ate and left. Had better friday nights",2,Natalie,London
"I expected to be in for a decent meal, seeing I heard good things. But everything we ordered (we were 4 people and everyone got something different) tasted bad. Bland, better said. Even the guac! How is it possible to mess up guac? Maybe they had a bad day, but considering the price, I will never go back.",2,BusinessLunch,London
"I have eaten at Rosa Mexicana in the past (not this location), but was always very impressed with the food, not this time.   The tortilla chips were very average.  The guacamole was very good, but it was double the price of any Mexican restaurant that I eat in.  We ordered a margarita when we sat down, and had to remind our server 20 minutes later that we never received it.  For my entree  I ordered the chicken enchilada.  When it came to the table  I was told that the plate was very hot, which it was, but my food was not.  It was luke warm.  The enchilada also very over priced was not even that tasty.  My boyfriend ordered the braised brisket tacos, which had a great flavor, but also were luke warm.   All in all I had a very disappointing experience, and I felt it was very over priced for what it was.",1,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Excellent meal and great service . Enjoyed meal downtown more than Lincoln Center location,5,Fresser,New York Area
Really loved the experience at Rosa Mexicano. The food was amazing and the Mango Chile Margarita was great. The staff was very friendly  and attentive.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
First time back in nyc for a couple of years and first visit for my fiancé. Wanted her to taste great Mexican food and great margaritas. Staff very friendly and they make the best guacamole ever.,5,OpenTable Diner,Liverpool
Disappointed. Been there before and nothing was spot on,3,Hippo,New York Area
Great neighborhood place. Excellent service. Great margaritas. Best guacamole.,5,NZ2247,New York Area
I was little surprised to find out several dishes were not available even it was Friday.  But we enjoyed the food and service as always.,5,Cuquet,New York Area
"We were disappointed. Pom margarita was melted and the waitress actually said ""we are out of almost everything so tell me what you want and I'll let you know if we have it"". This was 7 on a Fri night!",3,OpenTable Diner,Philadelphia
Consistently good food! Best quacomole and pomegranate marquritas. Great service. Nice ambience,5,NZ2247,New York Area
Food was great! Service was excellent.,5,OpenTable Diner,Philadelphia
"Won't be coming back. The food pales compared to how it used to be. Now it's like a chain restaurant, complete with constant up-sell attempts. Waaaay over-pricedL $15 for a cup of guac? My prediction: Out of business in 18 months.",1,Bill,New York Area
"Met a friend for lunch, and had nice meal with a very nice margarita. It was quiet enough for us to talk and catch up. The waitstaff were attentive. It was my second time there, and I will go back again!",5,Howdythere,New York Area
I had the shrimp tacos - it was disappointing because the food came out cold and bland (both the shrimp and taco and the side of corn) ... skimpy portion for a $20 meal but at least the service was very attentive and my sangria and company of friends were above par...,3,MAYster,New York Area
"I am a big fan of Rosa going back to the early 1990s, when I used to live around the corner from the original restaurant (when it was half its current size).  What I am most disappointed about with the current incarnation -- both in Tribeca and elsewhere -- is the margaritas.  They used to be known as ""pink 'gitas"" and all one needed to say to get one was to ask the bartender (Roberto, in those days) for a ""frozen with salt"".  Now, they've changed the recipe for the worse, and they no longer have the bitter sweet taste they once had.  I cannot emphasize what a disappointment this is, but I suppose they are more bland and generic, which may go with the whole chain restaurant approach that Rosa seems to have adopted.",3,Jamie,New York Area
"Lovely interior, imaginative and delicious food that doesn't shout ""vegetarian"".",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
They wiped the crumbs off of our table and were very attentive!,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
This is one of the best restaurants to open in New York City in ages. I'm not a vegetarian and I love it. Vegans will be pleased because the server always asks if a vegan menu is needed at the beginning of the meal so that vegans at the table will be satisfied.  It's also good for business meals and - yahoo - Nix is now open for lunch. I'd recommend this place to anyone who loves good cooking.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
This was my 5th visit since NIX opened and it did not disappoint in any way. I might suggest that the menu choices have a very long run - and could benefit from more frequent introduction of a few new items more often or perhaps a special or two in choice of entrees. That said what is on the menu is great and I understand seasonal limitations.,5,ArthurL,New York Area
So delicious! Creative veggie food is so much more creative that food with meat.  This place does it right.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Exciting and tasty vegetarian food.  The vegetarianism was not over-the-top or in your face, just delicious.  So much better than Dirt Candy.  There were a couple of mix ups with the service (forgot a side order, forgot that the mains hadn't arrived yet) but it was very pleasant and enthusiastic.  I would definitely return.",4,OldMannishBoy,New York Area
"Restaurant recommended by friend for dinner.  I had brunch with a friend.  Fortunately there was a non-vegan menu-I knew this was a vegan/veg restaurant but did not go for this reason or any food sensitivities.  The food(egg in a hole/toast/avocado) was mediocre.  It tasted good, seemed like moderate quality ingredients but was so overpriced for what it was which was a fried egg sandwich with avocado smeared on top.  Nothing special about menu, this was only choice that seemed tasty.  Service was very good and ambiance was very LA-light, open.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Nix was fantastic. One of the best brunches I've ever had, and definitely a great find for the area. Will def return for brunch again and for dinner. Great for vegans or vegetarians too.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
The place is nice and food was good. However the person at reception was rude. She claimed to have someone request a table. And they get that table. I have been to 100's of top notch restaurant. They do the best to give you a good table and one that is available. Rather than one by door when other tables are available.,1,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Makes vegetarian food taste better than steak (coming from a born and bred carnivore),5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Very fine veg. restaurant with food that might turn a carnivore to the green side ! Worth the trip.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Great way to enjoy vegetables, whether vegan or vegetarian. Good cocktails too. But we felt rushed &amp; nickel &amp; dimed.",3,JudyA,New York Area
"Periphery servers (hostess, busers, etc) were great - main server was so-so.  Food was WAY too expensive for what it was - $30 entrees of all vegetables is ridiculous.  We had to ask for double orders of things that were presented way too skimpy to be acceptable (i.e., a ""smear"" of hummus so thin one person would have hogged the whole helping.) Wouldn't recommend.  Way better all veggie options at way better value.",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I'm a carnivore but I'll go to Nix for a solid foodie experience. Nix does not try to provide a faux meat experience, like making tofu taste like meat. Instead, it focuses on presenting delectable veg dishes. From tabasco-flavored egg salad to cauliflower tempura wrapped in a dumpling, the dishes are creative and tasty. Allow the excellent sommelier to choose your wine from a small but well-curated wine list. The only thing lacking are red wine glasses (you know...the big bottomed ones), but I'm told that's coming!",4,art4fart,New York Area
New lunch menu is terrific. Great option in neighborhood for business or get together with friends.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I have been to Nix twice. The food is very good and interesting, but service could use improvement... both times they overcharged us. The first time we ordered 3 entrees, they only brought 2, and then charged us for 3. The second time they forgot our dessert,  apologized profusely, and then brought it 30 minutes later. We had already paid/tipped by then, but they asked us to pay again for new check w/ dessert. When I questioned it, they said not to worry about it, and then my card was charged for dessert.",3,ABNYC,New York Area
Beautiful presentation.  Excellent dining experience.  Great choice for vegetarians and vegans looking for a more refined dining experience.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
The food was amazing  It's pricey Least fave was pineapple dessert Otherwise a magnificent culinary experience Capable staff Nice wine selection,5,PatriciaM,New York Area
"Nix's aesthetic is fresh, modern, and welcoming. The restaurant is spacious and bright; it was easy to stay for a couple of hours to enjoy the ambiance. The food was delicious! Many of the dishes are plant-based with a vegan version of the menu, too. For a Michelin-star restaurant, the prices were fair. I would definitely recommend Nix for a yummy weekend brunch!",5,Kelsey,Los Angeles
Food and service was great.  I love this place!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Nix is a sophisticated addition to NYC's vegetarian restaurant scene. Dishes are unexpected, flavorful, well-presented  and truly unique.  Excellent ambience, clean decor.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Brought my girlfriend here for her birthday (she is a vegetarian) and we had an amazing experience from beginning to end. We were sat right when we walked in with our reservation at a great corner booth. Our server recommended we each order one item from both the lighter and entree portion of the menu as well as a dip. We also ordered a few of their specialty cocktails which were wonderful. The food came out perfectly timed for a relaxing slow paced meal. The atmosphere was very hip and fun. Each dish we ordered was delicious and I definitely will be coming back soon to order completely different as I need to try the whole menu.,5,mattbk,New York Area
I saw a write up in Time Out about Nix so decided to try it out. The food and atmosphere was superb. I have told others about it and plan on going again.,5,JeffD,New York Area
"Alittle disappointed. No protein, fresh juices or good teas. Some very mixed food some great some ok",4,Shisho,San Francisco
"This is our second time. It was a novelty, but as in many non-Asian high end vegetarian places, the food is ultimately bland and overpriced.",3,nps3,New York Area
excellent food and a waitstaff who are quite familiar with the menu. the only negative is the noise level- pretty high and tables close together. the food was really exceptional though.,4,weeze,New York Area
"Good, slightly intrusive service.  Loved the flatbread and the various spreads.  Thought the two main dishes (cauliflower and broccoli rabe/artichoke) were too similar given tomatoes etc.  So, would look for greater variety in taste).  Limited Gin selection.  Coffee at $6 per cup v expensive.  Pineapple dessert the best.",4,elizabethd,New York Area
Absolutely wonderful find. Went for Sunday brunch and had the best brunch of our lives! Unique and perfectly executed food paired with the fabulous service and wonderful atmosphere make this place a must-visit. Get the benedict if you go for breakfast/brunch!!,5,LjCam,Pittsburgh
"The food here is really good and have a broad range of flavors. Each dish was not like any other. My girlfriend and I shared 2 dips and 4 plates, which was a lot of food. I would recommend about 3 dishes for every 2 people, unless you like to feel stuffed at the end of your meal. We also really enjoyed the service provided by the hostess and the other staff.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The food is so scrumptious and filling that it's hard to think of it as vegetarian. The staff is incredibly friendly and makes you feel like a regular. We arrived late on a busy evening and our table had been given away; somehow, they managed to find an empty table for us.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

"Attractive ambience, moderately creative cuisine, well meaning but poorly trained staff.",3,TheDoctor,Dallas
"My second visit to Nix and it is reproducibly excellent. One of the best vegetarian restaurants I know of in New York. The food is amazing, the service is great and the atmosphere is cozy and intimate. The portions are great for sharing multiple dishes and the food is satisfyingly light but filling. I highly recommend making a reservation as this place is nearly always hopping.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
There was far too much vinegar in the brussels sprouts but the polenta dish was very good. Don't regret having tried the restaurant but unlikely to go back. Some staff was pleasant but others seemed a bit sour.,3,nycgal,New York Area

Excellent Vegan/Vegetarian food. Service was swift -- if not a bit rushed. Bathrooms are clean but absolutely freezing cold during the winter --also there was absolutely no hot water in the bathrooms even after letting it run for a few minutes. Scary to think that the employees wash their hands there...,4,Foodie4Life,New York Area
"A beautiful, sublime meal. Crudités starter was fresh and lucious with labne and red pepper dip. Cauliflower was a highlight. My carnivore boyfriend went out of his mind. Ban Mi meets General Tso's kitchen in Peking Duck bao. The bean curd sheets were a delicious and playful take on enchiladas.",5,CarlaC,New York Area
A wonderful night! Attentive service and interesting vegetarian dishes.,5,KnightofCups,New York Area
"The food is delicious, particularly the avocado-mint dip, the labneh, and the cauliflower.  We loved everything except the cabbage shoulder.  The bread that came with the dips was scrumptious but too skimpy, even after ordering a second serving.  As a general matter, many of the dishes tend toward goopy (the cauliflower was a notable exception that had crunch), so it would be good when ordering to try to pair goopy with crunchy or dry.  Maybe it's just that we didn't order it but there seemed to be a paucity of grain and bread options and the desserts could have been more diverse for vegetarians (if not vegans).  We loved that the waiter asked if we were vegan or just vegetarian and if we had any allergies and then we saw the allergies prominently posted at the top of our bill.",5,Michelle,New York Area
Hottest table in New York.  My only wish is they were open for lunch.,5,Sasha,New York Area

As always a great meal,5,ArthurL,New York Area
"Great concept in a cozy little restaurant. I was looking for a little more wow than what i got. Run of the mill crudités accompanied by a really good eggplant relish, egg salad that in fact,  if it was an egg ""salad"" would of provided a little more interest than the half hard boiled egg version that was served. The Shiitake mushrooms were delicious. The cabbage shoulder was outstanding and the desserts were a hit. Great wine service came with gracious server action at a well paced cantor. I think we will see more vegetable guided restaurants in NYC as the years go by.",4,Levy,New York Area
It's always wonderful at NIX!,5,Villagehaunts,New York Area
"What a fantastic spot and the food is so delicious and beautiful you don't even need to tell anyone it's vegetarian. So satisfying - you will hardly miss the meat! We especially loved the cauliflower tempura, dips with tandoor bread and shiitake with polenta. Yum!!!",5,sfnative,San Francisco
Great restaurant! Very nice wine list and excellent friendly warm service.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

"amazing food....taste is out of this world! ambience could be better...,but i would go again and ahain just for the food.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"It would be wrong to describe Nix as a vegetarian restaurant.  It is a fine restaurant that creates elegant vegetarian meals.  The restaurant itself is beautiful, with muted colors and lighting, and comfortable seating.  The food was delicious--we especially enjoyed the labne appetizer dip and the shitake mushroom cacio e pepe, where the flavors of the vegetables came through in combination with satisfying textures.  The egg salad with habanero cream and potato crispies was a clever way of elevating egg salad.  The artichoke and broccoli rabe sautee was excellent, although the preserved tomatoes and eggplant were a bit too salty.  The burnt broccoli could have been more burnt, and it was probably the least successful of the dishes.  We were especially delighted with the dessert of macerated figs with creme fraiche--very satisfying and decadent without being too rich.  We thought the service was terrific, especially the sommelier, who spend a bit of time with us talking about the wine.",5,ETFishman,New York Area
Delicious food is alway,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"First time to this relatively new neighborhood vegan/vegetarian restaurant.  Wine (Merlot) was top notch! Among the best I've had. The food (we chose vegan menu options), was creative, tasty, although not among the best I've ever had in a vegan restaurant. Appetizer pepper dip and eggplant dip tasty but not memorable;  salad (kale and beets)very good; stuffed tofu wrap, OK, mushroom entree tasty but overly salted; chocolate mousse desert, a misnomer...not like mousse at all and very sweet.  All in all a nice addition to the area; upscale/pricey, but a pleasant night out.",4,Zizi,New York Area
The food is always beyond wonderful. Perfection.,5,OpenTable Diner,Denver
"Phenomenal. Truly delicious, inventive food. Sampled 6 different plates. Each contained so much flavor, had interesting textures, and was beautiful to look at (so much color!).  By far the best vegetarian meal I've ever eaten. I'm still daydreaming about that maitake mushroom with truffle, the roasted broccoli, and the butternut fry bread days later... Can't wait to return.",5,OpenTable Diner,New England
Amazing food  (though small portions)! Chocolate mousse cake and tempora cauliflower stand out! Exemplary service. Low key elegant vibe.,5,Debbie,New York Area
"Exciting, elegant vegetarian with some fabulous dishes that don't make you feel like you're a rancid hippie.  The blood orange and jicama salad and the cauliflower tempura are very tasty, inventive, fresh and original. However, portions are dainty while prices are high -- for veggies. The service is nice and professional. If you sit at a table in front of the bar you will be crushed by the mob of people waiting to be seated. If it's not their famous pineapple dessert, don't bother with dessert. It's not on a par with the rest of the dishes. As always in New York, it's too noisy.",4,Grandenchilada,New York Area
"I've been to Nix before, but this time was a total let down.  The food just isn't as good anymore and they increased their prices of their cocktails.  It was my favorite place that I raved about before, but not so much anymore.",3,hchan46,New York Area

"My wife and I had brunch on Saturday at a table and ate dinner on Sunday at the bar. Received friendly and totally professional service at both meals. The decor and atmosphere is very attractive and pleasant, but the vegetarian cuisine (vegan is also on offer) is nothing short of phenomenal. Amazing flavor combinations and inventive spicing and seasoning. Not to be missed at every opportunity.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"The food is amazing! Definitely grab the burnt broccoli. Great atmosphere, wonderful staff.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

Filet mignon (medium well) was one of the most expensive, tough and poorly seasoned steaks we've ever had!  Dinner for two (no appetizers, no drinks) was $180.  Ouch!   Maybe the experience of a rare steak lover would be different!?!.",3,CGWHITE,Tallahassee

Great location. Excellent steaks and the service is awesome.,5,cygnus,Tallahassee
It was the best steak house experience my wife and I have had. We enjoy going to nice places quite often and this place set the bar moving forward. Our server Courtney was outstanding.,5,OpenTable Diner,Oklahoma City

Anniversary,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
It was a great dinner.  I would highly recommend it,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"We go to Ruth's Chris every time we are in Destin. The service is impeccable, and the wine list leaves no room for complaint. We always order the same meal - which we look forward to with great pleasure - the Porterhouse for two, with Voodoo Shrimp to start, and Caesar Salad. The only side we order is the steamed spinach. This meal is so superb it almost defies adequate adjectives. It is perfection, every time.",5,Sylvia,Tallahassee
"Great experience, beautiful atmosphere and terrific food and wine.",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
Best fine dining experience ever! Celebrated our 15th wedding anniversary perfectly...,5,Aaron,Tallahassee
"The service was top notch, and food was phenomenal!!",5,Durasul58,Jacksonville
"Bone in NY strip is a featured item. Ordered mine medium rare. It arrived medium well. Was offered a replacement.  It arrived medium, I kept it.  BUT I couldn't eat it. I cut it and there was so much gristle I couldn't hardly get it cut . No way could I chew the steak.  Steak with fat is okay but when it's gristle it's not. There was no flavor and not edible.   I left it that way,  butchered and not eaten.   My wife had surf and turf.  Ordered Medium Rare came medium well. No pink. More like buttered sirlion.  She was  offered a replacement and she declined it.   Manager did come out and apologize.  Lobster was good. Daughter had crab cakes and where good. Lobster bisque goods, sides good.   Now comes the weird part . Manager  comped my wife's dinner.  6 years of patronizing this location, last 2 years have not been good.",2,OpenTable Diner,Indiana
It was a pleasant visit,4,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
Great spring vacation dinner!,5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
We had the oysters Bienville last week and came back again for them.  Excellent!!  We also shared the iced Seafood Tower which was outstanding.  Clearly the best restaurant Destin has anymore.,5,Kathy,Tallahassee
"I ordered a steak salad and I received a salad with no meat, just greens. That was definitely annoying since the waiter repeated my order to me before leaving! Then, I ordered a filet steak, well done, and the inside of the steak was actually bleeding, as if it were still alive. Totally disgusting and I am not satisfied with the Ruth Chris out in Destin. There are definitely better steakhouses in Atlanta, GA. The waiters were polite, however they obviously were not paying much attention to me.",2,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
Great steak and the head waiter John was excellent.,5,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
Excellent food and service.,5,Kiwipal,Las Vegas
The steaks were okay. Not the same quality as Ruth Chris in California or Texas. Had the full filet and the bone in ribeye. Steak size was right. The taste was not what we are used to from Ruth Chris.,5,OpenTable Diner,Los Angeles
AWESOME PLACE FOR DINNER ........THE SEAFOOD TOWER IS TO DIE FOR,5,Puttingg,Jacksonville
"The food and menu selection was great. Steaks were very flavorful and very tender, true to Ruth's Chris tradition. They came out sizzling on a hot 550 degree plate,  However, I must say though The ambiance was very lacking. It seem like I was thrust back into the 1980s. Definitely needs decor updates at this site. Moreover the lighting was very bright for dinner time. Supposed to be a nice romantic venue but it felt like the middle of the day.",4,OpenTable Diner,San Antonio
Excellent service very attentive and respectful. Loved the ambiance and the special treat for our special celebration.,5,FrequentDiner,Jacksonville
"Service was excellent though the greeting at the entrance was poor.  As far as atmosphere, this is the weakest RC I have been to. Have eaten at two in Chicago, NYC, Palm Desert, Atlanta, and now Destin. Food was very good though I have to say that I am growing weary of paying $50-60 for a steak then $15-20 ala carte for three sides.",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Valentines Day celebrated on the 15th of February,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"The service was outstanding! The steak was cooked sub par, and the asparagus was completely over cooked. Half of the asparagus was black with the consistency of rubber. I couldn't even cut it with a knife. I've eaten at many Ruth Chris's and this by far was the worst. The best part of my experience was the waiter who was again, outstanding!",3,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
Always come here for a special date with my wife for our Anniversary and Valentine's.  This place never ceases to impress us.  We will continue to comeback here to celebrate all the special moments in our lives!,5,OpenTable Diner,Las Vegas

"Before dinner cocktails, bar atmosphere, and live music excellent.   A wonderful dining experience.  Start to finish.",5,OpenTable Diner,New Orleans
we have been to various locations across the nation over the years. We thought we could count on it. I had the petite filet and this was the problem. It was the worst steak I have ever had at a Ruths Chris.,3,OpenTable Diner,Richmond
"Superb service, excellent food and perfectly prepared. Dinner music was a nice touch. We enjoyed an unexpectedly fantastic evening. Very impressive service.",5,Kajoie,Los Angeles
We enjoyed our meal and the service was excellent. The valet parking was a nice surprise. I noticed the decor was dated and the covered seating at our table was soiled and stained.  Overall we had a pleasant experience and wonderful meal.,5,AMac,Hawaii
Food was amazing service was great just really high priced,5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
Ruth's Chris in Destin rocks. I have been to many of their locations but the one in Destin is a franchised location and the owners are serious about putting out the best product. On wednesdays they have one of the best happy hours in Destin in the bar. How can you not love a restaurant with three bars! Steaks are the best in Destin.,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
The food is always consistently good and the atmosphere is ver nice.  Great restaurant to have a relaxing meal.,4,Tracy,New Orleans
Great Food and exceptional service. This place is very consistent with all they do.,5,OpenTable Diner,Dallas
Steaks never disappoint.  The service is the best in Destin.  We will come back at every opportunity.,5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
As always the food and service are all beyond amazing! Love this place for date night,5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
As usual had another great meal at Ruth's Chris. Only local restaurant where you can get service almost as good as on a cruise ship!,5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
We never have a bad experience at Ruth's in Destin.  We go to the beach quite often and  always make a reservation here.  It's probably the prettiest Ruth's we have ever been to.,5,Bobby,Las Vegas
"Waitservice was very lacking. I had to go find him when we were ready to order. Bartender was no where to be found. Very disappointing service to have spent $1.000 on meal. Will have to reconsider next time. We have spent over $10,000 with this restaurant over last few years.",3,Foodcritic,New Orleans
I enjoyed the service most of all at this restaurant. I would recommend it based on that alone.,5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"Jamison and supporting staff were superior. Steak was cooked to perfection. Great place to celebrate achievements , life or the end of the week.",5,OpenTable Diner,New Orleans
"My wife, daughter and I had a 5:00 pm reservation.  We walked in at 2 minutes till five according to the young lady at your front desk.  She advised that we could not be seated until 5.  I asked why?  She said the cooks get uppity if we seat guests early.    While this conversation was being held there were at least two couples that walked in and right past the front desk to a dining room in the rear.  My response to the front desk was ""I should get uppity and eat some where else.""  My Wife insisted that we stay.  We did.  The meal was great but I do not plan to return.

Celebrating our 25th wedding Anniversary and it was so nice! Loved it,5,OpenTable Diner,Dallas
This wasn't my first time at Ruths Chris but it is always outstanding.  The steaks are unbelievable. Juicy and tender. Outstanding service.,5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"It was an excellent first-time experience at Ruth Chris. The staff was very friendly. My only thought is that it would have been nice to know that there was an ""early bird"" menu which allows people to try a little bit of everything. We were made aware of it by another couple. Other than that, it was a wonderful dinner.",5,TRG1,Savannah
Great dining experience as always.  One of our most visit places to eat while in Destin.  Our waitress was exceptional and we will be asking for her in the future.  The food and ambiance was perfect!,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Enjoy sitting in bar area for my meal. But this visit the whole entrance to the bar area smelled like soapy water. Yucky Shelley bad smell soapy water. Please fix this. I ate in a hurry to get out due to the smell.   Otherwise I love this  place!,3,Zippy,Orlando
"My husband and I dined at Ruth's Chris for Thanksgiving. We viewed the menu online prior to arriving with an idea of what would be offered only to be told that Ruth's Chris Destin is not part of Ruth's Chris corporate but is an independent franchise.  While they offered A Thanksgiving menu, it was individually priced. It was a disappointment since the menu online was presented so nicely in three courses with one set price. However, The food we ordered was excellent and nicely served. The waiters were very nice and professional. The reason I gave the service a lower rating was because of the time gap between them returning to the table. Glasses were empty.  At a regular restaurant I would probably not notice but for the price you pay at Ruth's Chris Destin I felt like that should have never happened especially since they were steady but not extremely busy and there were two servers attending our two person table.",5,patt,Tallahassee
Great Thanksgiving meal with family and friend. A great place to enjoy a fine meal with great drinks.,4,David,Tallahassee
"Ruth's Thanksgiving was incredible, memorable, romantic would not hesitate to return on any number of occasions.",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee

"We continue to take our elderly godparent's to Ruth's Chris as a special treat.  This time we were able to dine in the very private wine room, and it was so much easier for them to hear.  Food and service  - top notch!",5,GAPeach,Atlanta
We very much enjoyed our dinner at Ruths Chris! Food was amazing and service was up scale ! It is pricy but worth it!,5,fairviewmom,Nashville
Great restaurant. The steaks were not as good as last time. A bit disappointed. Good ambience and nice music.,3,cygnus,Tallahassee
Ruth Chris is the absolute best!!  We started out at the East Bar for happy hour and it was fantastic!  We then went outside and dined.  Great meal and service all along the way!!,5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
Took a while to get served then the food came out really fast.  No time to enjoy ambiance.   Steak was good.  Lobster OK.,3,OpenTable Diner,E. Tennessee
Our experience was great. Excellent food and drinks. Plus a free Birthday dessert. The service (Robin) was fabulous,5,Dale1,Denver
The 40 ounce ribeye 20 ounces of it was bone. My family owned their own cattle farm and meat markets. That was one of the worst steaks I've ever had. I cook 20 oz. ribeyes boneless 10 times better on my worst night cooking.  I would not go back.,2,Twix,Atlanta
Do not know what has happened there. Terrible!!,1,OpenTable Diner,New Orleans
Food was great Waiter was very knowledgeable and professional,5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"Me and my wife have been to multiple 5  star reastuarnts and never have we had a horrible food experience, the lobster bisque from bob steak and chop house was great and decided to trying here , it was bitter , greasy in fact 2 spoonful bites later I wanted to gag , so I gave it the benifit of the doubt and waited for my bone in New York strip , and it was  horrible , no flavor badly cooked and it did not smell fresh at all the worst restaurant I've been to , 3 forks , bobs steak house , ocien prime etc etc have never let me down but this was horrible , the waiter was great",2,OpenTable Diner,Dallas
"The only problem was our steak (porterhouse for two) was overcooked in places. I ordered it medium rare, and it was in places. Other parts of the meat were medium, and others were medium well. I think it may be an issue with the broiler and suggest they check the equipment. The service was excellent and the sides, salad, and dessert were perfect.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Wonderful service, perfectly cooked steaks and great drinks",5,OpenTable Diner,E. Tennessee
The Staff went out of their way to accommodate my special parking needs and to ensure a most delightful dinning experience with the most perfectly grilled fillet and side items.  The mood was exactly what an anniversary dinner called for.  I congratulate and thank all members of the staff and cooks for their outstanding service.,5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"Husband's steak was cooked to perfection.  Mushrooms were great.  Incredible service and attention to detail that was much appreciated.  I had the crab cakes, and although good - really would have benefited from more acid which could be easily provided by extra sauce or a lemon wedge on the plate.  Would definitely return.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Absolutely wonderful! The service was top notch and the food was unbelievably amazing!! The filet and lobster tail both melted in my mouth. The mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts were great. Our waitress Cheryl was wonderful and we can't wait to go back.,5,Moana,Nashville
As always a delicious experience!!  We definitely recommend Ruth Chris to our friends.,4,dougandcarol,Tallahassee
"Great venue, food and service to celebrate a special family occasion.  You know you won't be disappointed with the friendly service and ambience.",4,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"The Destin RC is consistently outstanding in all aspects. If you haven't been there, go and try the porterhouse for two!  There is really enough for three or a nice take away - we can never finish it. Try it with steamed spinach and voodoo shrimp. (The menu doesn't list steamed spinach, just creamed, but they are always happy to accommodate such variations upon request!) the waitstaff are always very friendly and smiling. We go every time we are in town, and always leave happy.",5,Sylvia,Tallahassee
"This has become my favorite steak house. I loved the live music, ambiance, customer service,  and especially the food. My bone-in ribeye was so good i wanted to suck on the bone.",5,EricD,Chicago
"Our food, particularly the steak was of the highest quality, complemented by a great wine list that our waitress knew very well. The restaurant was near empty when we went, mid week, except for a few others including a party of six. Most unfortunate, as wanting somewhat of an intimate dinner proved impossible; we couldn't avoid the very loud conversations and drunken addresses to all, coming from the table of six that had clearly enjoyed the wine list. A great restaurant/manager would have taken care of the necessary to ensure all dinners had a good experience. That aside, while the food was very good,  price point compared to other comparable  restaurants,  is towards the overpriced end. I wouldn't rush back.",2,Ashley,London
Great dinner !!!,5,lulu,Cincinnati
We come to this location every year for our Anniversary.  And we have never been disappointed in the food nor service.  For that matter we have never had a bad experience at any Ruth Chris that we have visited across the USA.  Ruth Chris Destin Miramar Beach is always top notch in our book....well done!,5,OpenTable Diner,New Orleans
As good as always. One of my favorite places to eat.,5,OpenTable Diner,Louisville
"Food was great. Surprised to see the same server from our last visit (it's been a while). Service was great and his cohort was funny as well. My husband and I joked about never being able to finish our  water before it was refreshed, not a bad thing.",5,Tealwish,Richmond
As excellent as one would expect from a Ruth's Chris.,5,arglaw,Miami
Service is always excellent and food is second to none.  Our favorite restaurant.,5,Harley,Birmingham
"While we have not been fans of every Ruth Chris restaurant that we have dined in, the one in Destin is a stand out.  Warm, impeccable service, ambience that is really relaxing and food so exellent that we leave already anticipating our return!",5,NancyC,Tallahassee
Best crab and escargot!  Love to come for special occasions.,5,MaryM,Tallahassee
We will definitely return! We have found our new favorite place.,5,StevenG,Tallahassee
"Very disappointed from such a well known name.  Definitely not worth the $300 bill for the 4 of us.  One order of the filet was undercooked (server agreed) and sent back; it came back 2 minutes later still undercooked. Not worth any further effort on that one.  Second order was a rib eye which was also undercooked but tolerated.  Another order was for the ""special"", an 11oz filet with lump crabmeat and special sauce. The order came out with the filet only and nothing else. It was too late to wait for the order to be corrected as we had somewhere else to go. And who wants to sit and wait while they get their act together. Eating together is the reason you go.  I would not recommend.",1,Ozman,Dallas
There is a reason they can command premium prices. The food andservice met or exceeded our expectations.  Beststeakever.,4,ToddD,Birmingham
No matter what is ordered...it's delicious!  I always look forward to dining with you.,5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
As always Ruth's was amazing. I love the service in Destin the food and the ambiance. Outstanding. Love coming to this restaurant when in town. Yummy,5,Teee,New Orleans
"Service was simply outstanding and that made the evening. However my steak was tough, lots of grit, and bland.",3,PrestonW,Little Rock
Had a group on family vacation. Everything was excellent.,5,OpenTable Diner,Miami
Absolute best steakhouse we have ever visited. Outstanding food and service!,5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
Everything was a 10! Love going there whenever I am in town.,5,Pierre,New Orleans
Greeted us by name and the food was superb.,5,Michael,Los Angeles
There's no better place than Rith's Chris in Destin. Great salads to start and the steak is always amaZing. And pair it with a great wine. Boom. Greatness. Could not recommend it enough. Thanks again!,5,BigDawg,Dallas
"We had a SIGNIFICANT problem at our visit at this restaurant; an unfortunate occurrence at a place we have frequented many times.  On our arrival this visit, we were told we could not be seated due to ONE member of our 11 person party who was not dressed in ""Resort Casual"" dress.  While I understand that the restaurant has a fine reputation, there was absolutely NO MENTION of this dress code at the time of making the original reservation, nor was there any clarification of what exactly ""Resort Casual"" dress actually consists, especially in a beach-side resort location where most patrons would be dressed casually at best.  In addition, initially there was no attempt by the staff to help our party member rectify the situation and the hostess seemed somewhat condescending and seemed either too busy or too unconcerned to help us rectify the situation after we had driven for over one hour to patronize Ruth's Chris.  Eventually a manager intervened on our behalf, providing a ""proper"" shirt and the dinner after that was uneventful with good service by our dinner service team.  It however was humiliating to the particular customer involved and quite offensive to our entire party and I am unsure as to whether or not we would return again in the future; again very unfortunate in that we have been long-term Ruth's Chris customers and advocates in our travels about the country.  A simple clarification of the restaurant's dress policy at the time of reservation booking could have avoided a very stressful, unfortunate and unnecessary episode that may end up costing them significantly more than this single family of customers.",3,BobbieF,Little Rock
Cannot say enough great things about this place! Mouthwatering steaks and appetizers. The staff treated us like family. Will be back next time we’re in Destin.,5,OpenTable Diner,Memphis
"Having been to this Ruth's Chris in the past, the expectations were high.  Unfortunately, my wife and I were disappointed during this visit.  Not being a very busy night, we were seated in the back part of the restaurant where there were only two tables of diners, as opposed to the front of the restaurant, where there were more diners and the atmosphere was more lively.  The service was okay, but nothing spectacular.  As far as the food, this was the biggest disappointment.  The filets were cooked according to our instructions, however, the meat was tough and hard to chew.  The appetizer of fried green tomatoes and the side of roasted brussel sprouts were delicious, however, could not compensate for the main course.  Hopefully, this was an off night, not only for the wait staff, but  for the kitchen staff also.  We will definitely return upon our next visit to Destin, and look forward to an exceptional dining experience.  Prior to the meal, we went to the East Bar to partake in Ruth's Chris happy hour.  I would highly recommend this, not only before dinner, but on any night to just relax and enjoy as the bar menu looked very tempting and the drinks were excellent.",4,rmscott,New Orleans
An extremely nice dining experience for steaks and lobsters with excellent service...deinitely a 5 Star restaurant.,5,OpenTable Diner,Denver
Our waiter was amazing and the food was spectacular! I would come back in a heartbeat!,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
We eat here every time we come to Destin.  Ruth's Chris never disappoints.   We take our two young children and they are treated so kindly.   We can't wait for our dining experience here!!,5,OpenTable Diner,Nashville
Very good food and service.,5,Steve,Birmingham
"Great food in a beautiful setting.  Portions very large, so think about sharing some of the appetizers or salads!",5,OpenTable Diner,Washington DC
Beautiful place and lovely staff. The food is excellent. It’s a perfect special occasion venue. Be sure and ask for Anastasia; she an excellent server and absolutely charming!,5,Ludu,Washington DC
"Drinks were delicious. Food was delicious. Server did not present the dinner special right, however-HUGE disappointment. He said it was LOCAL SNAPPER and it was non local salmon. We eat salmon all the time. My filet was ordered medium and it was served medium well, they re made it and it was medium rare-it was delicious none the less second time around. We were also charged for both dishes still after two large disappointments. Not sure we will be back for dinner service, maybe a cocktail at the bar.",2,OpenTable Diner,Jacksonville
"We were there on a night when it was empty.  Hard to judge ambience when there is no other energy in the room.  Jennifer, our waitress, was terrific.",4,gregm,Pinehurst
Wonderful dining experience from start to finish. Oysters on the half shell were accompanied by some fresh sauces that set them off. Fried cauliflower was sumptuous. Paella had the right crust and an excellent variety of seafood. Orange chocolate martini was a great finish to a good meal. Service was spot on. Knowledgeable server who was attentive without hovering. Beautifully appointed dining room.,5,Leese,Nashville
"Food was sub-par. Rice was the consistency of mashed potatoes. Wonderful ambience, terrible food. Mashed potatoes that accompanied the ribeye was the only highlight.",2,OpenTable Diner,San Antonio
"The food was OK, not exceptional. The service was pleasant, but more training is necessary. Our entree was placed on the table while we were still eating our salad. Is no one trained to ""serve from the left, remove from the right"" anymore?",4,OpenTable Diner,Denver
Great all around! My husband and I always declare a “winner” for whose meal was the best. For the first time we had a tie! Both were so good we couldn’t decide. He had the red fish special and I had the blackened snapper. Appears you can’t go wrong here.,5,JillP,Tallahassee
Excellent food and service. Great selection of food and drinks,5,Larry,New Orleans
We enjoyed a nice Sunday Brunch. The meal and staff were perfect. Will return again in the future.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The Primrose was outstanding in many ways. Our waitress, Anastasia, was exceptionally friendly and competent. The food was delicious and enjoyed by all. The atmosphere was beyond beautiful. It was exceptional in every way. Loved this place so much we will return.",5,OpenTable Diner,Seattle
"Big disappointment - heirloom tomato salad made up of tomatoes with no flavor , Blackened Snapper, tiny portion(2""x2""x 1/2""), over cooked (mushy) on a bed of something ?? Filet overcooked and way over salted. Passion fruit creme brûlée topped with a strawberry and what looked and tasted like chunky apple sauce. Overall way overpriced for the quality of the meal especially the snapper. Better places with really good food in the area.",2,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"We had a lovely experience at Primrose, once we found it. Instead of following GPS, pull into The Henderson entrance and drive up to the valet area. Once inside, take a left, and another left after the check in desk. The service was great. There were many small touches, like a little honey pot and sliced lemon with my tea, and a cute little purse stool. Great sushi and serene environment. Definitely recommended!",5,OpenTable Diner,E. Tennessee
The food was good and the restaurant was lovely. The service needs work and there should be some sort of dress code for the guests and staff considering the price point.,3,Carpool,Atlanta
We had high expectations given the chef's touted experience but none of the flavors worked. Very disappointing if you consider yourself even somewhat of a foodie.,3,OpenTable Diner,Nashville
"It was our first time staying at the Henderson, though we've gone to Destin for 20+ years. The restaurant was very well designed with good lighting, comfortable seating, and beautiful local art. Our server was attentive and accommodating; I had a food allergy for which she was able to easily sub another side, and she created a vegetarian plate for another guest. The sushi we had to start was very creative and tasty, and the portions for the entrees were a good size. After dinner, we moved to the bar for a nightcap and the waitress brought our drinks to us once we moved to the veranda. I look forward to going back on our next stay!",5,gigi,Austin
We ate at  top five restaurants as reviewed on Travel Channel and this was the best meal we had. Highly recommend!,5,BDoots,Tallahassee
A highly anticipated addition to the Emerald Coast! The cauliflower and burrata appetizers were top-notch. Chef fuses global flavors into the local cuisine for a unique and delicious experience. This will undoubtedly be worked into our routine while in the area.,5,William,London
"Chicken and okra stew was amazing, everything was delicious.",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"Food was very good with local seafood featured. Service started out great, but then lagged as dinner went on. Appetizers were not brought out together. Waitress seem to disappear at times.",3,CAB33,Philadelphia
Everything about our experience was positive. From great food to beautiful views of the gulf and dunes to the atmosphere but the service by far was most exceptional.  Highly recommend!,5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
The Blackened and Chef Special Snapper was fantastic!  The Chocolate Lava cake with Peanut Butter was the best we have ever had.  Foodies will be happy here.,5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"I took my daughter there for her 20th  birthday and it lived up to our expectations, we had a lovely time.",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
They took their baked oysters off the menu and replaced them with raw oysters that were way too small for $3 a piece.  The grouper was overcooked and lacked flavor except being extremely salty.  The pork shank was the best thing going.  Full of flavor and very tender.  Our server was great and Bobby at the bar was excellent.,3,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
I have been to Primrose four times. This restaurant has so much potential but they really need to step up their service.  The waitress was pleasant but had too many tables considering the physical size of the restaurant.  Food does not always come out at the proper time which is very annoying. It's a shame because the ambiance and food quality is good. And the  sushi is the best in the area   But waiting too long  for tea refill or for some one to bring you the salt you asked for while your food gets cold makes me not want to go back.  Once one of  the four entrees  we ordered came so late  he other three diners  had finished eating. Please Primrose hire more wait staff   Have the kitchen get all entrees and sides out at the same time. (I realize sushi comes out whenever it's ready and that's ok)    You have a diamond  in the rough. Polish it,3,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
"We had an enjoyable evening.  The food was delicious. We had the blackened snapper, shrimp and gritcake, and the roasted cauliflower for an appetizer.  They were all wonderful.  The only problem we experienced was when we tried to order a couple of things they were already out by our dinner at 6:15. Other than that we would recommend it to anyone looking for a classy and enjoyable date night.",4,ambie,Phoenix
Unfortunately food was not good. Everything was very salty. Steak was served rare. Staffing was nice but very slow which I didn't understand seeing how there were only 3 other tables dining in. Huge dissatisfaction expected more especially because they rolled out a new dinner menu. Not a great start,2,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"Excellent food and service. Prices high, so save for a special occasion.",4,Buffs,Houston
"Wife and I were celebrating our Golden Anniversary, and I guess I expected more on behalf of the Primrose Restaurant to acknowledge the occasion beyond the waitress simply congratulating us on our special anniversary -- no flower for the wife, no special price for any extra offering, nothing of the sort. Our server Anastasia was outstanding in every way. For a 5-star restaurant in a beach resort, I found the menu extremely limited -- one chicken dish, two steak options, a lamb rack, four seafood options, and a vegan platter (no pork, baby back ribs, prime rib, lobster, surf &amp; turf combo, etc.) The 'ala carte' dinner pricing plan is outrageously high -- $36 for a 10oz Ribeye, and if you want a salad ($11) and a vegetable (only one selection @ $6), you pay $53 for the meal. Finally, I ordered my steak grilled medium and it was delivered well done. It was tastily seasoned and I would have rated it outstanding had it been grilled to my requested medium doneness. An overall disappointment on our Golden Anniversary!",3,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
Entres very expensive. Reservations at 7:15pm. Ordered meal at 7:30pm. Meal arrived at 8:30pm. And this was a Tuesday night!,4,Ivey,Nashville
Dinner was delicious!  We had the lamb and loved the sauce with it!  Everything was outstanding!  The service was great!  The staff was very friendly and accommodating!  It was definitely an upbeat experience!!,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Lovely new place, we throughly enjoyed it!  The staff was so nice and the food was delicious!",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
Beautiful setting in a new resort  near the foot of the Mid-Bay Bridge. Enjoy the dock to dish seafood.  Ask for server Joni.,4,DandJ,New Orleans
"A really great experience.  Staff was very friendly and professional.  Food was excellent, but menu was somewhat limited.  Would like to see a little more variety.  Overall a nice environment for a romantic occasion.",4,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
Food was wonderful. A bit too noisy. Servers were new .,3,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"We live here and yet this is one of the most gorgeous venues we've been to down here. Highly recommend for drinks on the patio, in the Horizons bar or dinner in the restaurant!",5,OpenTable Diner,Orlando
45 minute wait with reservations but was an excellent meal,5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"Our group had a delicious dinner.  The wait staff was superb. From the moment we walked in to the end of our stay.  We were graciously greeted and our server was knowledgeable, and eager to please.  It was a magical evening.",5,OpenTable Diner,Minneapolis
The service was excellent the shrimp and grits perhaps the best of ever had!,5,OpenTable Diner,Las Vegas
"The restaurant is new and the staff is attentive clearly eager to please. They were very understanding about my companion's difficult food allergies (onion, garlic) and went out of their way to make an appetizer I ordered just for myself capable of sharing. My martini didn't come out quite right but was swiftly and adeptly rectified. Food was delicious. I'd prefer a cozier ambiance but the restaurant is very nice.",3,Jessica,New York Area
"Great place but a little pricy for what you really get. The decor was also a little dated. However, the service was great, and the food was very good.",4,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"we have been fans of Ruth's Chris for years. At this location, though, the food has not been up to their usual standards. My steak was overcooked and even though I asked for the lobster tail to be slightly undercooked, it too, was overcooked. The waiter never stopped to ask if everything was cooked the way we wanted, although he did ask if we were ""doing OK."" We will most likely not return to this Ruth's Chris location.",3,nlgcoach,Washington DC
"Father's Day celebration while on vacation. My husband LOVES, LOVES, LOVES the ahi tuna appetizer and he is NOT a big fish eater. We ate there twice, once in the bar just to get the tuna and another for dinner. Beautiful restaurant. My grouper was a little too well done but still very good. Dessert (chocolate lava cake) was wonderful. We are big fans of any Ruth Chris's restaurant and love OpenTable.",5,Grace,Louisville
Steaks were prepared exactly as described.  Consistently excellent.,5,Aguyfromatlanta,Atlanta
"We were a group of 11 people and were put in a private room. There was no music, no ambiance, not even pictures on the walls. Boring and depressing. It put a damper on conversation and pretty much ruined the evening.  Service was great and the food was great as usual but that room needs some serious attention.",3,OpenTable Diner,New Orleans
"Enjoyable experience. Very pleasant staff, great menu &amp; food. Thank you",5,Casual,E. Tennessee
Our dinner experience was marvelous! It was a very special mother's day celebration with the added treat of Mr. Michael J. Thomas. WOW!,5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"We took my mother for Mother's Day Brunch. The brunch menu was fine for all of us, except I ordered my favorite chopped salad and was happy to pay extra. Our favorite waiter, Brian, once again made the experience very pleasant. He made great wine suggestions and was attentive without overdoing it. Another good time!!!!",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
Excellent food and service as always!,5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
Very elegent dining experience!,5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"The manager and staff went out of their way to make my family event special. We sat in the wine room, listen to really great jazz sax live, had drinks prior to dinner and then have a GREAT meal. I would highly recommend and thank you to the staff.",5,OpenTable Diner,Birmingham
My wife and I had a really good time.,5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
Took my daughter for her 16th birthday. Really highlighted a special occasion.,5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"Always good, never had a bad experience at any Ruth Chris. Yeah it's speedy but you won't be disappointed especially if you are celebrating a special occasion.",5,OpenTable Diner,Nashville
"We went there for our Wedding Anniversary and had a wonderful dining experience. The food and wine was excellent. The servers seemed a little inexperienced, but were nice and accommodating. I was a little surprised that guests were allowed to wear flip flops and shorts into the restaurant, but it is a beach location, so I guess that's okay.",5,Tturner360,Tallahassee
Food was awesome and service was over the top! Can't wait to go back on our next visit to Destin !,5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
Exceptional service. Staff was very friendly. Food was wonderful. It was well worth the the check,5,OpenTable Diner,New Orleans
"Everyone from the staff at the entrance through Cheryl, Ben, Nathan and the manager were wonderful, helpful, and friendly. The food was splendid. Thank you to everyone for a great experience.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"If you are looking for fine dining, this is your place. From the moment that we walked into this restaurant we were greeted with poise and respect. Being 21 we normally are not as well respected at these restaurants, though they welcomed myself and my boyfriend with open arms and we were will to help us every time we needed it. We had the surf and turf.. which was AMAZING! All together this restaurant is expensive though it is very worth the money. For the two of us it cost $500.",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"One of the best steak houses, as always, the steaks are cooked to prefection and the hot plate is fantasitic.",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"Very good food and atmosphere, but on the pricey side - would reserve for special occasions.",4,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"Had the fillet with sauteed green beans, home fries and cheese cake. Almost perfect except for the side dish (Lyonnaise)which is a fancy name but really are just flavorless home fries. The staff are inviting and tentative to your needs. The atmosphere is calm &amp; romantic with jazz playing in the background.",4,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
Food was over priced. I have eaten a better steak at Outback for about 1/4 the price. Service was bad. We had 2 waiters and my tea glass sat empty for over 5 minutes on 2 occassions. Would not recommend this place to anyone.,1,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"Very good food. We really enjoyed our steaks. I had the petite filet with the oscar topping and it was excellent. The only complaint was that my drink was too weak for the $10 price tag. This is the third different Ruths Chris that we have eaten at and out of three, it is the second best.",4,OpenTable Diner,Mississippi
Food was outstanding as usual but there were delays between courses. Specials should be written down for the hearing impaired...my father ordered the lobster special thinking it was $18 instead of $18 a pound.,4,Daniel,Tallahassee
Quality and consistancy with everything. Service and friendliness ever present. Prefer Ruth's to Morton's and other steakhouses.,5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"You are probably wondering why I titled this review Butter Steak. You guessed it, the steaks are so tender and succulent, I could literally run my butter knife through that 6 oz. steak. The taste was so amazing, every bite left me yearning for more and more. The family style sides were generous, enough to take home for a midnight flashback. The service, impeccable! They really know how to make you smile. This is the first place I ever dined that dressed the water picture in its own apron, talking about classy. The atmosphere was memorable, ambient sounds of cutting age Jazz by the baddest most talented local on the horns, Michael J Thomas. The guy knows how to work the crowds. Overall, well worth the money, it certainly pleased my honey!",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"This place was an amazing place to dine. The food was outstanding, service was great, and the atmosphere was amazing. I would definitely recommend this place to my friends and family.",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"I made a reservation on a whim and got in right away.  The entrance to the driveway was a block down from the restaurant which made for some confusion intially, but the valets were prompt and courteous.  Inside, the restaurant was clean and orderly, and the staff was friendly and welcoming.  The wait staff was good...not too clingly but also didn't ignore me.  The food presented nicley, was at a proper temperature and tasted delicious.  I would easily dine here again and would highly recommend this restaurant.",4,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"I read several mixed reviews of Ruth's Chris, Destin. Most of what I read involved the food not being worth what you pay for it. If you are on a tight budget- probably not the place you want to go. For a special occasion where you don't mind dropping over $100 for a nice time and excellent food (particularly if you're a steak person)I think Ruth's Chris in Destin was excellent. My wife loved it as well and we will go back for our next special occasion.  I had read that there was suggested tipping rates for servers and for the valet... I never saw anything that gave prices at all. If you can't afford it or don't like steak- don't go.",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"When the Destin (FL) Chamber of Commerce announced it's annual Restaurant Week, I looked over the list of participating restaurants &amp; saw Ruth's Chris listed. I've been dying to try Ruth's Chris (in any city...anywhere!) for a few years but never seemed to have the chance. I ""carpe diem'd"" &amp; went. Had the filet &amp; shrimp dinner (out of several tantalizing options) that came with choice of salad, choice of side, &amp; dessert of mini-cheesecake &amp; homemade chocolate bark. I chose tomato, asparagus, &amp; hearts of palm over mixed greens salad--yum! but a little heavy on the dressing, &amp; green beans with roasted garlic--enough to share. It was a little bit pricey for me, but it was delicious, I had leftovers &amp;...hey! I'm worth it!",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"Excellent food, but very pricey. Service was great. Steaks were one level more well done than ordered. Wife ordered medium and got medium well. I ordered medium well and got well done. Problem is that steaks here are served on a very hot plate and one would do well to order a level below what you wish to eat, as the steaks continue cooking on the plate after you are served. Not really a problem, and a nice touch. But keep in mind that you will need to order one level below what you actually want.",4,OpenTable Diner,Minneapolis
Meal was paced very well. Food was prepared as ordered and served at the correct temperature. Staff was knowledgeable and attentive. overall experience was outstanding.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"All of the categories in 2 above although good for measurement, Ruth's Chris is noted for its food and it was simply below par based on 20+ years of dining major occassions only with the same. I selected the Destin Fl location because it impressed me more than others in every category during a 2008 visit, the last decent meal of my life. I was involved in a life-altering auto accident in NYC, broken spine, neck and extensive other physical damage crippling me until my 16th surgery fixing my broken neck on 9/27/2010. I spent $29.68 + $5.00 tip for two drinks at the bar and then $160.69 + $35.00 tip for our meal=$230.37, all saved from my social security disability check because i haven't been able to work in years. Ruth missed.",2,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"Pricey, but well worth it. Outstanding food. Excellent service without hovering.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Reliable, friendly service, fantastic food and they took a special request for a favorite dessert no longer on the menu, and it was just as great as we hoped it would be. Ruth Chris in Destin is a very special place with the best steaks in town.",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"Did our family New Year's Eve dinner here, a total of 7 - had my parents, 2 teens &amp; a 4 year old with us. Reservations for 6pm Be prepared to have 'forced' valet parking at this location, or you have to park across the Parkway, no parking on your own. ""Suggested"" tipping. Our waitress was very pleasant, friendly and stayed that way through the entire visit. Ambiance was nice, as the restaurant filled up, the room did get a bit louder. We had to raise our voices to hear each other. Food was very good, served hot as usual! We had everything from steaks, lobster, shrimp, and plenty of sides. I'm not certain the food is condusive to cost. Would recommend for special occasions.",3,acctspd,St. Louis
"Asst. General Mgr ""Norm"" Word was very congenial and the waitstaff was attentive to our needs. We have never had a bad meal experience at a Ruth's Chris Steak House in our many visits over the years. We look forward to our next visit.",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
The food and service was excellent,5,amazing,Western KY
"Again, Ruth's Chris delivers the best steak I have ever eaten! Thank You!",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"This was not my first visit to Ruth's Chris and I was disappointed. We arrived early and it took us 20 minutes to get a drink from the bar which we had to go get ourselves and then the drink was made wrong. It was a Pomegranate Marguerita and instead of using sour mix, they used straight lime juice. It was awful and when I sent it back, no attempt was made to make it right. The service was not good. My iced tea remained empty for 15 minutes even while I held the glass in the air trying to get someone's attention.",2,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
When fine dining it's the little things. We had to ask for bread twice. They boxed up our leftovers and mixed up the items amongst the four of us. And some of the patrons didn't adhere to a proper dress code. But...the food was great.,4,Daniel,Tallahassee
Very nice. I'm partial to Kansas City's Ruth's so it's hard to be fair To other places.,4,Dominic,Tallahassee
"Went on a Sunday evening, so may not have had their best staff. Wait staff seemed very young or not very experienced. I have been their many times before as we live nearby and food has always been very good. This time the food was good, but not up to RC's standards, and certainly not for the prices charged. On a more positive note, the setting was great with a nice fire in the fireplace on a chilly February night.",3,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"Really loved the hot plates on which our delicious steaks were served. They should consider serving the side dishes on hot plates also, our mashed potatoes cooled down rather quickly. The chocolate creme brûlée was delicious. Truly enjoyable birthday dinner.",4,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"The food was fab!!! Will def return for another special occasion as it is very pricey,, but soooo worth it.. Yummy,,,",5,OpenTable Diner,New Orleans
Great place for special occasions.,5,chas,Tallahassee
"The hostess sitted my husband and me in a busy hallway. We drinks kitchen and the traffics through the area was terrible. I think the table was an ""after-thought"", that's how we addressed the location. Horrible experience, food was not piping hot, do disappointed! We will never select this restaurant. We eat out 90/100.",1,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
Great choice for New Year's Eve dinner!,5,OpenTable Diner,New Mexico
For the second year in a row we went to Destin's Rurh's Chris and had a great meal and a wonderful way to end 201. Food was perfectl cooked and service was first rate. No feeling of being rush because of the date.,5,Bobatty,Tallahassee
"Although you may have eaten at a Ruth's Chris before, you probably haven't eaten at one like Destin's!  Great food, great service, and a much better feel than the traditional mahogany and cigars atmosphere at the others.  One of my destin favorites!",5,RBEAS,Charlotte
"The occasion was a belated birthday treat for my 15 y.o. grandson (who is a devoted foodie, like his Nana). To say the least, he was impressed. Ruth's Chris is now the dangling carrot to entice Jacob to study hard, go to college, &amp; get a good job...so he can afford to take NANA to Ruth's Chris!!",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"Food was excellent with perfectly done steaks and a great sweet potato casserole. The service, however, did not meet expectations of this quality of a restaurant. Bread arrived late and we had to ask for butter.",4,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"Great wine and liquor menu. I dont think it is Ruth Chris's ""thing"" but would injoy a wider selection of beer. A nice ale or lager would be very enjoyable with their steaks.",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"I was EXTREMELY dissappointed with Ruths' Chris, because a fire alarm went off and our server told us ""this happens regularly ever since we had the water leak. The only people who can turn it off is the fire department."" The alarm &amp; flashing light went on for 20 minutes! Half the patrons left during this commotion. After the noise finally stopped, the manager came around &amp; asked how things were and NEVER offered a free dessert,a free glass of wine,a free entree or ANYTHING! He kidded around about the noise &amp; then left as if this were an every day occurence. We spent over $400.00 for the dinner &amp; would have like a little acknowledgement about the horrible noise. Not recommending this place to anyone after this!",1,mskazooli,Tallahassee
The evening was a wonderful experience. The service was fantastic and the food was great! It was a special occasion and they truly made it special.,5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
Expensive but worth every penny!,5,yummy,Atlanta
"Ruth's Chris is generally a wonderful experience... in this case, not up to the ususal standard. In our pary of 8, two of the steaks were cooked to the wrong temperature and one of those had shrimp added when it should not have been. Upon returning the two steaks, one of them came back undercooked rather than over cooked but the hot plate brought it to temperature. The other steak, while sill a bit over done was not up to the ususal standard. The filet was not filet tender and one of my guests ended up not finishing the steak because of the low quality. To be fair, they did not mention the substandard steak until after we had left so our server wasn't given the opportunity to make it right. Two of our party of 8 had issues...",2,OpenTable Diner,Dallas
"Great atmosphere, Great service, even greater food!!",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"Deautiful restaurant. My wife's steak came out undercooked, so we sent it back. After 15 min, I had a cold steak and she had nothing. Waiter, who was very nice initially now ignored us. Assistant waiter was very helpful, called the manager over. He was very apologetic, and we started all over. To his credit, the entire bill was written off. Food was excellent once we got it correctly cooked. Will have to try again to see if this was a glitch",3,tarheelmd80,Orlando
Best vegetarian I have had. Super service and great wines,5,TheMayor,New York Area
Great steaks and a beautiful facility,5,VirgilS,Houston
"Food and service was great, everthing else waas unacceptable. The temp in the dining area was AWFUL. Your hostess should have told us the ac was out and we would have re scheduled. People around us were fanning themselves. The staff said oh it is being repaired and they are working on it. My shirt was wet and I did not have a jacket on.",1,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"Had a fabulous 21st anniversary dinner at Ruth Chris Steak House in Destin. First time to use Open Table for a reservation and it was extremely easy. Our waiter, Jon, was very friendly and helped to make our special dinner that much more memorable. The plate full of decadent desserts was an unexpected surprise. There was a saxophone player performing near the front of the restaurant and helped to set the romantic mood. Would definitely recommend and go back.",5,OpenTable Diner,Mississippi
"There was nothing different I could've wished for: prompt, courteous (but invisible) service throughout the evening. The courses were fantastic (I highly recommend Voodoo Shrimp when it's on the menu). Everything ran like clockwork on the service end; we were never rushed and had ample time between the generous courses to relax. The live music was entertaining but never distracting; ambiance was extraordinary. Even a ""regular night out"" turns into an ""event"" each time I dine a Ruth's Chris.",5,Keysdiver,Tallahassee
"From the time we met the valet staff until our departure the entire staff was very gracious and helpful. I have only three complaints: (1) My first complaint has to do with my T Bone. It was somewhat tough, not very tender and my wife wouldn't let me complain at the time. (2) Then I had to ask for the specials because I saw them on line and the waiter stated they don't put them with the regular Menu. Why? (3) The lightening was a little to dark for my liking, I couldn't even get a good picture of my Bride and I while in the restaurant that Tony the waiter graciously took for us.",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"Tara was just the best I was not able to get a sitter at the last minute but I needed my Ruths Chris steak. I was with my two children and the hostess Kelsey and Tara offered us a DVD player and movies to help with the evening and the assistant Will even brought there drinks in kids cups with out any problems. Every step of service was perfect and my 8 year old ate about 30oz of my 40oz porterhouse steak. We will be back and will ask for either Tara, Brandon, or Brian as I know of them and there great personal service.",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
This was the best Ruth's Chris we have ever tried. It is next door to our vacation condo and we have never tried it as we have had bad experiences at the one in Nashville (our home) We celebrated our 29th anniversary there and it could not be better. They even gave us a little cheese cake to take home. Our wait person was fabulous as was the rest of the staff.,5,MJMc,Nashville
Food was good as I always expect for the prices....service was very awkward the whole evening. They never acknowledge that it was a special occasion and asked for the check after I signed it... This should NEVER happen. Bill was over $400 and I got second rate service for this. Not sure I will go back.,4,Foodcritic,New Orleans
Ruth's Chris is a wonderful place to eat on very special occasions. It is way too expensive to go any other time.,5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
Excellent food and service (as usual from Ruth's Chris). The manager went out of his way to ensure that we had a great experience. Highly recommended.,5,OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 1, 2011"
This was our second dining experience @ Ruth's Chris. We had dined in Indianapolis previously. Once again it exceeded our expectations in all areas starting with the cocktails through the dessert. The service was over the top. The selections on the menu are simple yet comprehensive. There is something for everyone. The steaks are second to none &amp; perfectly prepared. The only downside to our experience was that we felt the recommendations for ordering sides was a bit robust. We could have ordered half the recommended sides and been completely satisfied.,5,Mare,Cincinnati
Great service and great food. Steaks are the best around and a needed change for our beach trip where seafood was on our main focus. This chain restaurant normally is more formal but this location welcomes a more casual attire due to the laid back beach atmosphere. Great place to have great food &amp; service with a great atmosphere.,5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"Great food. Service was pretty good, except the waiter didn't bother to share Kid's menu options, although we clearly had a child. Then, one steak was under cooked and I had to wave down the water boy to find the waiter and have it cooked more.",4,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"Ruth's was able to seat us in a private dining room, which worked out extremely well since our party included a baby.",5,OpenTable Diner,Phoenix
"Awful! Awful! Awful! Crabmeat mushrooms were fishy tasting, both our steaks completely overdone -- at a world renown steakhouse!! The waiter and manager did work with us and comped our ENTIRE meal. It was a disaster and such a disappointment, especially since it was my first time visiting the restaurant after hearing how amazing it was from so many people.",1,Lori,New Orleans
I was actually disappointed with my NY Strip but the AHI TUNA was AMAZING!!!,3,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"There is no better steakhouse in the United States than Ruth's Chris'. Service is suberb, food is consistently exceptional, and the steaks are the best. I've eaten at dozens of these Steakhouse, and I love going there because I know what to expect, and I've come to trust them to deliver.",4,chiefmadman,Denver
"Easily the best vegetarian meal I've had in my life and one of the best meals you can get in NYC, period. My date was vegetarian (I am decidedly NOT) and she had an amazing time; it was such a relief to be able to select anything on the menu without worries, and to be served at a Michelin-starred level all the way through. We need more restaurants like this on the New York scene for sure—we are way behind the West Coast when it comes to this level of vegetarian cuisine, and Nix is a step in the right direction.",5,Iamanewyorker,New York Area
"Such a relief to eat at a vegetarian venue that doesn't focus on meat substitutes. The flavors were inventive and well-executed. Service was friendly but not overbearing. A little heaviness on the salt in a couple of dishes keeps the food a 4 instead of a 5, but that might just be our preference. We will be returning.",4,WDWD,New York Area
"Wow! So good. To say this is the best vegetarian restaurant in NYC right now is to do the food a grave disservice. It's so much better than the other options. The creative treatment of ingredients was surprising and fun. We particularly enjoyed the cauliflower tempura and the roasted pineapple dessert, but there were no misses here. We'll be back as soon as possible!",5,VEGGIEFAN,New York Area
Delicious!!!,5,Montauk668,New York Area
We were in New York visiting family and wanted a special evening meal to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We had never before eaten in a Michelin starred vegetarian restaurant. The ambiance is great in a very well designed space. The service was friendly and efficient without being overbearing. The cocktails are very creative and the wine list is very good. The food was amazing. There is a short menu full of superb dishes. We shared our dishes so it was more like a tasting menu. I think the management should consider offering a tasting menu paired with wines. That would make a great restaurant perfect.,5,LondonFoodFan,Birmingham

Fantastic Valentine's Day lunch!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

"We had a wonderful time. We were 3 older women celebrating a birthday. The food and service were great!! It got very noisy, I had been warned. And it wasn't cheap! I'll recommend it to friends who like vegetarian food and have money to spare.",5,Helene,New York Area
The Shiitake mushrooms with Polenta were delicious. The cauliflower with Buns were amazing...one of the best vegetarian meals I have ever had ! The papadams and hummus fantastic. The freshness of all the vegetables was notable !,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

"Best vegetarian food in Manhattan, hands down.  Thoughtfully composed space with  lovely lighting and comfortable seating...We have been a few times and will return...

"We ask the waitress about the New York Steak Strip, she stated that is was good and it was marble then the ribeye steak. When we received the steak,the steaks had fat on it at the end of the steaks. I inform the waitress and she stated ok and then preceived on. No one addressed the issued. The valet parking was good.",2,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee

Food was delicous as always.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The food at Nix was incredible. We are both vegetarians and have been to our fair share of veggie friendly restaurants but none of them compare to Nix. The treatment of the vegetables and ingredients was thoughtful and they let the vegetables shine. Don't miss the jicama ribbons and of course their specialty--cauliflower tempura with steamed buns.  The service just was OK. Our waiter did seem a little snobby even after we ordered drinks,a bottle of wine, and our fair share of their dishes.  Food was an absolute 10/10 but the service could have been better. We will be back the next time we are in NYC.",5,Emily,Baltimore
One of my favorite restaurants in NYC. The chef is the master of layering flavors and bringing vegetables and  grains to an incredibly delicious level!!!,5,LisaMA1963,New York Area

"Great ambiance, excellent service, and beautiful presentation. For brunch, our 3-dips appetizer was absolutely delicious. I felt that the other brunch dishes were lacking a little in taste for a Michelin star restaurant. Our main items were good, but I was not blown away. I'd like to try this place again for dinner, as I feel that meals not centered around eggs would be a little more creative/tasty.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
I always love eating here. Always. It is my favorite place to eat in New York and a must do for vegetarians.,5,AmandaH,New York Area
Favorite vegetarian spot.   Sophisticated menu and decor.  Well trained staff.  Great for brunch and dinner.  Too many healthy spots resemble 70's yoga studios... not here... Enjoy!,5,NewYorker687,San Francisco

"Excellent vegetarian options done creatively.  Ambiance was lovely; a bit noisy at times but the setting was intimate enough to make it workable.  Staff was outstanding - well balanced between attentive and leaving you room to enjoy without interruption.  A bit pricey for the options, but would certainly recommend.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"More flavor and sophistication than you can expect. The multi grain stir fry had that amazing quality of a smoky ""wok breath"" and is really best shared.",5,Live2eat,New York Area
We ordered just about everything on the vegan menu and it was all spectacular! Delicious vegetarian food but very unique as well. Would definitely go back!,5,OpenTable Diner,Los Angeles
"Service was nice, ambience was nice. Food was mediocre given that the dishes were made by a Michelin chef. The appetizer bread and dips were really good (recommend: red pepper dip). The carrot dish under the menu's ""Lighter"" section was a huge disappointment - the carrots were hard to chew and the dish had minimal to no flavor. The cauliflower buns were creative but not worth all the hype and the tofu skin pockets were tasty.",4,GY97,New York Area
Excellent vegetarian food and very attentive service,5,Henry,New York Area
"Vegan and Vegetarian menus crafted from locally sourced ingredients. Incredible atmosphere blending contemporary, earthy elements with a cozy and welcoming ambiance. Waitstaff was knowledgeable, friendly and relatable.",5,Dana,Miami
"Our experience was fine, marred only by odd service, which was both overbearing and uncoordinated. We were rushed out, in fact.  The food is fine, but overpriced, and closer to OK than delicious.  I would not recommend to anyone who values good service.",3,Bourbon92,New York Area

"I went to Nix for my birthday with a group of friends. The waiter was phenomenal, even when my friends couldn't make up their minds or didn't realize that the restaurant did not serve meat. Quality was fantastic as well. I described my gnocchi as ""little pillows of heaven."" Dessert was on the house in honor of my birthday 😍 It was A+. Highly recommend the nuns puffs and the maple custard. Little noisy, but honestly so were my friends and I.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"A fantastic vegetarian dining experience. The dishes were creative, reasonably portioned,elegantly presented and delicious. It felt a tad pricey and the service was a bit spotty and pushy (but polite).",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Unfortunately they squeezed 7 people at a table for six so I was forced to sit on the corner straddling the table leg. I would have appreciated if when I called to see if they could accommodate a seventh person that they told me no, or yes if we were ok with squeezing. Thank wouldn't have invited a 7th person so that we could all be comfortable. There were many ways the tables could have been reconfigured to accomadate our party but no one cared to set us up. Also dirty wet plates were put in our table and a cappuccino was delivered by a waiter that said, ""I don't know if this is any good but i tried the best I could"" as he put it on the table. It was not any good.",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Our waiter was new, he probably should have had more experience before being able to serve on his own. Our meal was wonderful. We were never greeted by management.",2,OpenTable Diner,Tampa
"Exceptional meal. The food was perfectly prepared and served with attention to every detail in a way reminiscent of the great Chicago chop houses of the 50’s and 60’s.  Jamison and his crew were in charge of our service and they did not disappoint. Well paced and attentive but not hovering and pushy. It was a wonderful birthday dinner and coincidentally, close to our 50th wedding anniversary.  Thank you for this great night.",5,Jnjinnc,Tallahassee
Just So-So for a $250 meal. Haven't been in a couple of years.  Not up to the standards set by other Ruth's Chris worldwide.,3,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"Out of the porterhouse at the time, but they made it all good by giving us two t-bones...steak for days.  Always delicious.",5,BandC,Seattle
"This place was top notch! Everything was so good and the atmosphere overall was incredible. My sisters and I went for my birthday and it was the best place we could’ve picked. Everything was wonderful. The food was outstanding, the service was impeccable, and they treated me really well for the occasion. I received a free dessert for my birthday and the live music came and played at my table! It was an experience! I recommend this so highly, if not for anything at least the experience. You will not be disappointed this place is literally so great and I can’t say enough about how good the food was. For sure the best steak I ever put in my mouth.",5,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco

"We love Ruth’s Chris steak house , you will not be disappointed. The steaks are so awesome , when they bring it to the table the steaks are sizzling . The side portions are enough for 2 people . The staff is very friendly, if you are in Destin and want a treat then go to Ruth’s Chris .",5,SandyV,New Orleans
"While we were having dinner, we watched a palmento bug crawl on the sheer curtains. We alerted our waiter, which caught it in a napkin and disposed of it. He then talked to the manager who took our drinks off our bill and gave us a free dessert to compensate us.  The manager never even came out to speak with us. The food was okay, but not fabulous. I ended up sick the next day. It was disappointing to say the least.",1,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
"My husband &amp; I were  celebrating our 29th anniversary on Sunday. We have lived in this area of Florida 28 years &amp; had never gone to the Destin Ruth's Chris, so we treated ourselves to this expirence. The ambiance was quiet , elegant &amp; romantic. We loved our meals, except my husband steak was a bit tough. I enjoyed every bite of my creamed spinach &amp; grouper dinner. I would recommend a trip here if you are able to come.",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee

Great vegan tofu scramble!!  The Nix Mimosa made the brunch even more enjoyable!!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"This was the worse visit to a Ruth’s Chris we have experienced. The valet and greeters were excellent; after being seated it went downhill. Our waiter Tara F. Should a lack of interest and attention. We waited over 15 minutes for acknowledgement and water. We waited another 15 minutes just for bread . After taking our order Tara Did not check on our table for approximately 30 minutes at which time she stopped only to advise us our food would be out soon, never asking if we needed anything additional etc. we were seated behind a large noisy party and it appears that was her attention based on a larger tip I’m sure. We frequently t Ruth’s in our hometown of Austin regularly and during travel and this is the worse restaurant visit of his caliber we have experienced. What a way to end a vacation.",3,Missy,Austin
"Absolutely excellent experience!  This was our 3rd visit to this brand, all at different locations. We were very pleased with the service, correction high level of service and quality!",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee

We celebrated my husbands birthday. Our dinner was excellent.,5,OpenTable Diner,Palm Springs
"Food and service were absolutely excellent.  My rating is 3 stars because of the noise.  There was sax player going table to table and it was so loud you could not talk at the table.  If you want a quiet dinner,  call and check the music first.",3,Kevin,Austin
"The best meal I've had in a long time. Complex and brilliant flavors. Was the perfect spot for my partner and I to celebrate a recent milestone. He doesn't normally care for vegetarian food, but this was far from your normal vegetarian meal. From the Tandoor bread and dips (that bread!), to the roasted avocado special (this was the highlight for both of us), to the rich, melt-in-your-mouth potato gnocchi with chestnuts &amp; truffle butter, it was a remarkable dinner, extraordinarily satisfying, and if I can say this, somehow light and decadent at once. For those looking for something on the heartier side: we, like the tables on either side of us, got the cauliflower tempura with steamed buns &amp; house pickles, and it was a big, filling plate, with the pickles, radish, sauce, and basil balancing perfectly.  Fun cocktails, excellent service, a truly memorable evening from beginning to end.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I am not a vegetarian or vegan, but the food was outstanding and I walked away completely satisfied, if you are V or V you will love it, if not go in with an open mind and be surprised.",5,LoveToTaste,New England

Very friendly attentive professional service.   GREAT flavorful dishes.  This place is a must.,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlantic City
Great food.,5,mgogel,New York Area
"We enjoyed our food but it felt like they were intentionally trying to rush us through every course. While the staff was incredibly attentive, it would've been a much more enjoyable experience if they didn't make it feel as if, despite having a reservation we were somehow an inconvenience.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Eat Your Veggies!  I am not a vegetarian but the dishes at Nix were delicious and unusual.  Potato gnocchi managed to be soft in the middle and crunchy on the surface, the tofu (actually Yuba) pockets were very tasty and the smoky eggplant dip was one of the best I have ever had.  The only miss for us were the mushrooms.  The green peppercorns, which I normally love, were so spicy that we couldn't taste any of the subtle mushroom flavors.  Skip dessert and walk over to Sundaes and Cones on 10th street for some Lychee or Hazelnut gelato.",4,PJWinner,New York Area
The food and presentation were outstanding. Service was perfect. Definitely order the pineapple for dessert.,5,OpenTable Diner,Raleigh

"We had to wait for our table to be cleared.   The food was Ok to above average, but not ""WOW"".",3,RayAndCo,Washington DC
"tofu scramble was so bland and watery.  moreover, it was small and expensive.  i was pretty irritated at the experience.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"If other restaurants used NIX as a benchmark the the whole restaurant industry would benefit.  They excel at paying attention to every detail of the experience without being intruding (confirming the reservation, service, food, decor including what looks like hand stenciled designs in restrooms). We come here regularly and have never been disappointed. The menu is vegetarian with a separate vegan menu as an option which is for the most part a subset of the vegetarian menu.  Every dish we've tried on our visits were creative, delicious and a new taste experience.  On this visit there was a special desert - tandoori pineapple- which was outstanding.   The only regret is that the Jackson Diner which is where NIX is now located is not also still on University.  NIX did keep the Jackson Diner tandoori oven however and they use it for the delicious bread that comes with the various special appetizer dips and various other dishes.",5,RetiredGuy,New York Area
"Very bad price-performance.  Went with 2 friends from work.  Server suggested getting  2-3 options from each section of menu and sharing.   Portions are very small when sharing, but too much of the same thing if you eat it yourself.  It turns out to be a very expensive dinner and you don't really feel satisfied.  (I am a vegetarian so it's not that).   We had two dips to start, plus the $6 bread.  Not nearly enough bread, but didn't really feel like ordering more at that price.  Maybe include bread when you order dip?  Salads and mains (""lighter and bolder"") were tasty but probably over-cheesy. It seems like cheese was on everything.  We did not like desserts at all (and we love dessert!).   Chocolate mousse roll had a weird taste, and nun puffs were undercooked inside, with a measly portion of sauces on the side.  It was very disappointing.   Our server was attentive and professional and we had no complaints about that.   Once was enough for Nix.  We don't plan on returning.  Not worth it.",2,SweetToothBaby,New York Area
"I really love the Nix, the food is always delicious but we had a snafu with our order. To their credit they anticipated that we were waiting to long for our food and offered us a free round of drinks but then the wait continued and I started feeling the alcohol and the need for food. Our waitress agreed with our complaint and we finally got our main course. I didn't time it but it was at least an hour? The table next to us had ordered ahead so while we were starving, we had to watch their table filling up with various dishes. In the end, they were very gracious and comped our check. So no hard feelings, the food is great, hopefully this was just a rare happening. I still love the NIx❣",3,Nicelady,New York Area
"I really enjoyed great foods, drinks, lively services and atmosphere! A little bit noisy but it is ok as everyone likes bed this place like us. Menu is really great and I cannot believe all are by vegetables with rich taste... I will definitely visit again soon!",5,OpenTable Diner,London
"Loved it! Nice people, helpful and friendly staff, loved the food, especially the stuffed cabbage",5,Suzy,New York Area
Loved the Brussels sprout salad and the tandoor with avocado dip. The tofu skins and mushroom entree were just alright. A bit pricey. Very creative interesting menu. Great atmosphere and cute bar.,4,Blake,New York Area

Great experience as always!,5,OpenTable Diner,New Orleans
"Have been a vegetarian/vegan-ish for 50 yrs, so you know I've tried it all re: veg cuisine. Nix offers pleasant ambiance, attentive service, &amp; you can actually hear your dining companion, however, the food was scarcely above average. Ordered four dishes: shaved brussels sprouts were dry and tasteless--dressing too acidic; yuba--which I love--was insipid &amp; mushy;  broccoli rabe saute--reminded me of what you'd find at a red sauce joint; king trumpet mushrooms &amp; morels were probably the best of the lot--though occasionally I'd  get a forkful of something so spicy that it overwhelmed the delicate taste of the ingredients. Dessert: sorbet--astringent and bracing. High prices for something that was, at the end of the day, rather average.",3,Katriel,New York Area
"A bit pricey, but pleasant atmosphere, tasty food, and perfect for vegan and vegetarians.",5,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
"This place has it all!!! (Except the meat, haha). Absolutely amazing, creative vegetarian food with a vegan menu as well. It's harder and more interesting I think to make fun and funky veggie food and this place truly delivers. The cauliflower dish is to die for, as is the cabbage steak. My spouse is nutso for the chocolate cake, but everything I've tried here has been absolutely amazing. The staff is super-duper nice, and the ambiance is great. Brunch is superb, as is lunch, and dinner too!",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
It couldn't be a better experience. I went there for my invited vegetarian friend. Great and differentiated food in a place full of unpretentious simplicity. The access can be difficult to find.,5,viaverde,New York Area

"The best vegetarian foods...each dish had an amazing combination of ingredients and favors. We over ordered...I wish we had gotten more advice from our server.  The dishes are not large, but very filling nonetheless.   Delicious food worth every cent!",5,OpenTable Diner,Philadelphia
Bold in concept with imaginative vegetarian food. This is not self conscious health food but a chef who respects the ingredients and those who are about eat those ingredients.  Almost a joy. Never inexpensive but you are paying for imagination and satisfaction.,5,Foodwoman,New York Area
Excellent food and appealing presentation. Have eaten in some very good vegetarian spots including plant food and wine in Miami. Would rank this in my top 3 or 4 - and even higher for Sunday brunch.,5,digestion,New York Area
"Very overpriced, particularly the gnocchi .30 dollars for a tiny portion. The wine waitress was the least friendly server we met in New York. I do not normally leave bad reviews but we were disappointed. The Yukon potato cake was greasy and left a bad taste in the mouth  . Would not go back.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Wonderful welcome by the staff with a charming sommelier. Menu not too long, fits on one page, but has really cool and unusual mixes. Dishes are perfect to share.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Nix offers a remarkably creative, fresh, locally sourced and absolutely delicious vegetarian and vegan menu. The food is beyond reproach. Also great (if short) cocktail list, good wine and beer lists. I'm not typically a dessert eater but have enjoyed two fabulous desserts at Nix--neither overly sweet, both heavy on fresh fruits and spice. Downsides: The wait staff aren't friendly--a combination of dour and too cool for school. You might expect the latter in NYC but the dour element makes for an unpleasant combination. Both times I've been to the restaurant I simply try to imagine that the staff aren't present (because the experience of the food is so joyous). Go for the food. You will not be disappointed in it--in fact, it's a minor revelation.",4,OpenTable Diner,Dallas
"Let me say very emphatically that I love dining at Nix in the evening.  However, I went to Nix for brunch for the first time on Saturday and was very disappointed.  Both of us had the patty melt -- a completely uninteresting, but filling and gooey sandwich.  Maybe I would have been better advised to choose an egg dish.  But our server enthused about the patty melt.  Now I know I shouldn't have been swayed, but I don't know whether Nix's egg dishes are better.  Go for dinner!!!",2,perfectdiner,New York Area
"Some of the vegetarian food is very tasty; some is just okay. The decor is fairly modern and the place is dimly lit. The food portions are fairly small and they recommend (strongly) that you order at least a certain number of dishes. Their upselling of drinks and desserts is a little pushy. They bring the drink menu ahead of the food menu, as if to compel you to order from it. The server asks, ""What can I get for you besides water?"" and ""What can I get for dessert? I recommend . . ."" It feels like a restaurant that is thinking of the bottom line at every step. That's the reality in New York, but good restaurants will find a way to avoid making you feel that way. Our server was not that well versed in the specifics of the food on the menu, nor vegetarian food in general. Nix is good, but it can be much better.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"You'll never miss the meat at this wonderful, innovative vegetarian restaurant.  Interesting but accessible menu and perfect for sharing. The small plates aren't really that small do order accordingly.  Friendly service as well. casual ambience.",5,jbdiner,New York Area

"Visiting from out of town, we were looking for a good vegetarian restaurant. I made reservations a couple weeks in advance for dinner on Tuesday at 9 pm. I'm not sure that was necessary but they were booked up the day of between 6 and 9 pm the day of. The food was excellent. The gnocchi with truffles was extremely light and fluffy but also was seared with a slight crunch on one side. We also had the burnt broccoli and the cabbage shoulder. Both were very good. The chocolate dessert with passion fruit sauce had very good flavor and texture. I would have liked a little more sauce to cut down the chocolate. To be fair, I am not a huge fan of chocolate but love passion fruit. For the food we received, I would say it was very affordable. I've spent a lot more for similar meals in many other cities. We also were seated right next to someone very famous which made the experience all even more enjoyable. We will be returning the next time we are in NYC.",5,Chrisma,Charleston
The atmosphere and decor was very nice. The cocktails were very well made. The servers were very professional and did not forget about you even when the restaurant started to fill up. We never felt like we were waiting too long for food or drinks. The support staff was great in clearing the empty plates quickly. The food was delicious and great for sharing. It was a tad pricey but overall it was worth it and will definitely go again!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

Food was terrific...server was unenthusiastic and generally unfriendly.,4,OpenTable Diner,Nashville
"As always, the steaks are the star. But I'm always a bit disappointed in the side dishes. The creamed spinach is good, but the potato dishes are a poor value, especially when one must pay separately for them. Escargot was good, and the desserts as well. The onion rings, mashed potatoes, and the au gratin potatoes are rather bland and not worthy of being served at this restaurant.",4,Jeff,Cincinnati
"Steak was excellent, as expected from Ruths. Server was on top of the service. Overall well done on our family meal.",4,JDStPete,Orlando
"Overall very good. Great steaks, great fries and great vegetables!",4,Lapple,Las Vegas
"This is my favorite place in Destin - the food is always perfect, and when I bring my kids they are happy to find a kid friendly dish for them.  They also have portable DVD players on hands with headphones and Disney movies should you need them - great way to keep parents, kids, and neighboring tables happy.",5,OpenTable Diner,New Orleans
We visited on Friday night for a family dinner while staying at Silver Shells. When leaving we noticed the pool table and stayed and played a while. The manager was so nice and when we saw the outside television and firepit we decided to return the following night to watch football and eat dinner. Our waiter was so attentive and friendly ! We were treated like locals and had a wonderful time. We will definitely return and recommend to all our friends.,5,OpenTable Diner,Mobile
Excellent as always. Osso Buco ravioli over the top. You don't go to Ruth's and talk about prices but $16 for a martini is a little steep. I'm glad there's a Ruth's in my town.,4,OpenTable Diner,Birmingham
Great thanksgiving meal. Fantastic service!,5,Dana,New Orleans
Food was okay at best. Their steaks are no different than those you would get at Applebee's. Crab cakes were really fishy.,3,OpenTable Diner,Indiana

This is by far the best Ruths Chris I have ever enjoyed. It was our daughters 6th birthday and the management and the entire staff treated her like a queen. Cheryl our server was perfect and the food as always was perfect. We have dined at all the local steak houses in the destin area and Ruths and Flemings are the only 2 places for fine dining.,5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee

Great restaurant. Always very accommodating!,5,OpenTable Diner,New Orleans
"I do not think that it was up to par. I expected much better. Ordered filet and it was stringy and chewy. Not the quality we usually get from Ruth's Chris. Had dinner a few nights later at Flemings in Sandestin and it was superb, much better than Ruth's Chris. Ruth's Chris has always been our favorite, but over $300.00 later, very, very, disappointed.",2,OpenTable Diner,Chicago

Did not care for my drinks. Mojito and vodka gimlet not up to my standards. Waiter was inexperienced. Asked if dram bruise up meant with out ice and had to return to ask if my vodka gimlet was with gin or vodka. On a positive note brought me another drink when Inexpressed displeasure with the gimlet.,4,OpenTable Diner,Cincinnati
I have never gotten a bad meal from this location. Our server was very attentive and the Martini's were outstanding!!!,4,beachgirl,Atlanta
"Of course the place is a bit pricey--170 including tip for 1 salad, 2 steaks, 2 sides, 2 cappucinos and desserts and one iced tea. The food and experience were wonderful, though--the onion rings are to die for and so is the cheesecake (that's the main reason I love Ruth's Chris. You won't be dissapointed if you go here--just be prepared to hand over the bucks!",3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"We went here while vacationing with family. It was a pleasant experience, and somewhere we always try to eat when in Destin. For a steakhouse, it's consistent and service was good. The sweet potatoes were a must-try.",3,OpenTable Diner,Shreveport
"You can't go wrong here! The food, the service, the wine list all impeccable!",5,Mike,Tampa
"Escargot appetizer was incredible, but the steak did not seem to be a prime cut. Food was good, at best. Not what I have come to expect from a ""prime"" steakhouse. Desserts were good...go with the bread pudding!!",4,OpenTable Diner,Tulsa
"Absolutely fantastic steak.  The food was great. Steaks done to perfection. The sweet potato casserole was delicious, ask for the recipe and I have come close at home, but not quite the same.  Service was 5-STAR without a doubt.",5,BillG,Milwaukee
"We eat here 7-10 times a year. The steaks are consistently good and the drinks are substantial. The wine choices typically include some excellent options not on the list, sometimes at great prices. The staff is always welcoming and competent. Try the Local's Bar for a very different dining experience.",5,JC93,Tallahassee
waitress was well-versed in the wine selection. Portion size enabled a second meal at home.,4,PARTYOF5,Tallahassee
Our steaks were perfectly done and delicious. The side dishes were plentiful and very tasty. The valet service was convenient and they were very courteous. We will definitely make another trip from Panama City Beach to visit Ruth Chris.,5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
Was surprised to see this was the number 1 restaurant in Destin according to Trip Advisor. The restaurant did not disappoint. Excellent experience and I would go back.,5,PorscheSA,Atlanta
"Still one of our favorite restaurants in Destin because of the relaxed gulf vibe and the outdoor dining in the Local's Bar.  We enjoy the mix of the quality of RC with casualness of the beach.  The food is great, the service is better and the bar is well stocked so I can't ask for more.",5,JC93,Tallahassee
For a Prime steakhouse this was a very poor choice. The strip and rib eye were both tough at Medium Rare. They were both served swimming in melted butter and neither were seasoned at all. Very flavorless. We dropped (wasted) $165 for this meal. Ruth's Chris doesn't even come close to comparing with Fleming's or Morton's. Longhorn would have been better.,2,OpenTable Diner,E. Tennessee
"The steaks at the Destin Ruth's Chris were not as good as we've had at other Ruth's Chris restaurants, and were disappointing. We chose this place for our one special meal for our vacation, and wished we didn't drop the money to eat there. I don't know if the chain has gone downhill since our last visit, this location isn't as good, or if we were just unlucky with this location on a weekday with these particular steaks.The steaks were edible, but were under-seasoned and generally nothing special.",2,VisitingFromCinci,Cincinnati
"Always enjoy Ruth's Chris whichever city we're in. Been to Las Vegas, Destin, Mobile and Biloxi. Would go a little more if it was a little less expensive or they offered more special deals. Food and service are always excellent!!",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
The steak was not what we are used to from this chain.  The ribeye was not what we expected.  The bone in sirloin however was excellent.,3,Wonderful,Atlanta
Wonderful  service &amp; delicious food. Made us feel special as we celebrated our Anniversary with family members. Served a special dessert in honor of the ocassion. Second year in a row we have spent our Anniversary at Ruth's Chris Steak House.,5,BSmith,Tallahassee
Amazing service to go with the always great food! We were dining with 3 little ones &amp; they were very accommodating. Steaks were perfectly cooked and every aspect was just what I expect of Ruth's Chris!,4,Foodlover,Las Vegas
Best steak on the Coast. Flavors were fantastic. The bone in Cowboy Ribeye was superb. We had our granddaughter with us and the staff were awesome.  They even provided her a portable DVD player and child friendly DVD. Terrific service. Strongly recommend it!,5,OpenTable Diner,New Orleans
"We thoroughly enjoyed our evening at Ruth Chris Steakhouse. The  ribeye &amp; filet were superb. We also had the key lime pie for dessert - one of the best we've ever had! The ambiance is very low key  &amp; nice. The service by our waitress was excellent. She was very charming, witty &amp; knowledgable . We will be back. Thanks!",5,Steverino,Dallas
We went for a special occasion. Food was wonderful and the servers were AMAZING! Rather expensive but well worth it!!,5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
The best dining in the area. Totally worth the price.,5,JC1986,Tallahassee
It was our first time ever eating at a Ruth's Chris and it was absolutely awesome. All around a great place to dine. Everything we are was delicious! Worth the price!,5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee

To many wrong things to list. This was our favorite Ruth's  but no longer. :(,1,NickkiG1,Las Vegas
Robin H was our table attendant and the service was excellent.,5,birthdaygirl,Tallahassee
"We've eaten at Ruth's Chris a number of times.  This time the experience was for the most part good.  However, my steak was over done.  I ordered the filet and asked for it medium rare.  It was on the done side of medium when it arrived and was more well by the time I finished it factoring in the hot plate.  Good flavor but not cooked to my liking.    The service was outstanding and we still enjoyed the evening.  Just wish my steak had been cooked properly.",4,DestinDrew,Tallahassee
"As always with Ruth's Chris, the service was just attentive and flawless. The location in Destin doesn't have a gulf view; however, the dining room is beautifully appointed. Courtney was our server and he attended to every need before we knew we needed it. We had our children (ages 14 and ) with us and it was their first fine-dining experience. They loved it. Other vacationing families had children with them and they seem to acclimate to the atmosphere well along with other tables of couples or adult diners.",5,wag711,Louisville
The food is always great and the service is outstanding.,5,cygnus,Tallahassee
"Excellent atmosphere, Great food, and Superior service!  I definitely recommend the Filet.  I will be back to visit on my next vacation.",5,FamilyFun,Atlanta
The total experience of dining at Ruth's Chris was over the top!  They are truly worthy of their coveted AAA 4 Star rating!  We plan to dine there again and again.,5,OpenTable Diner,Nashville
"This was the first opportunity we had to try Ruth's Chris and as it happens the occasion was our 20th anniversary.  We made the reservations on line which was very easy and user friendly too.  We received conformation via email and a friendly courtesy call reminder of our dinner time prior to arriving.  On arrival we were greeted by a friendly parking valet and matradee. Our waiter knew the menu, portions sizes and provided recommendations which were spot on.  The service and decor were excellent and so was the food.  Ruth's Chris reflects a refined and classy place for special occasions.  We will return.",5,ECB60,Tallahassee
"We went here during the week and it wasn't very busy.  The food was very good and the service was excellent.  We had one small problem with one of the meals, but the staff quickly resolved it and made it perfect!",4,CMC2112,Tallahassee
Ruth's Chris Steak House was a great dining experience for my 10 year old and I this past weekend. This is also the first time I used open table so I am pleasantly surprised with the results. They had my reservation and table upon my arrival.,5,Jennifer,Tallahassee
"The food was excellent and the service was as expected for a Ruth Chris Restaurant. We went with another couple that had a $50 gift card, with no expiration date, that had been given to them by their employer several years ago. The restaurant refused to honor the card as they said there had been too many counterfeits and they had posted two years before that they were not honoring the cards. The bill totaled almost $400 before tip. We just moved to the area so the other couple were embarrassed that they gave a gift card that was not honored. This is not the way I would anticipate a restaurant such as Ruth Chris to treat its customers. Great food but this has soured us on ever going back to any Ruth Chris Restaurant.",1,JBR1,Tallahassee
"While in Destin for the weekend my wife and I decided to dine at Ruth Chris.  This was our first time to experience a Ruth Chris .  Our server and his supporting staff were all very friendly and attentive to our every needs.  We were also impressed with the management team who took the time to come to our table to make sure everything was satisfactory and to say ""Thank You"" for dining with them.  The experience, food and service was great! From the moment you walk in the door  until the moment you leave the entire staff makes your visit a wonderful experience.  We look forward to our next meal at a Ruth Chris.",5,Glenn,Tallahassee
Service was awesome!!  The food was amazing!!  Thank you for an enjoyable experience. We will definitely be back to dine at the Destin location when in town.,5,Jjeats,Orlando
We eat here every year for our anniversary. This year the food was average and the service was terrible.  The restaurant was not overly crowded.,2,OpenTable Diner,Louisville

"Eat at Ruth's Chris steakhouse for an unforgettable meal! Absolutely the best, most succulent steaks, that's a given, but the crab cakes, the lobster bisque, all the sides are just amazing! Brandon, the manager, has a great disposition and truly caters to his customers. He keeps everybody happy! Jon, Tara, and Robin are great waiters and totally take care of their customers!  This is the place to go in Destin!",5,Lagniappe,New Orleans
"I had ordered a Ribeye steak that I was unable to cut, they replaced it with a fillet that came out after my Wife had finished her dinner. It also was not a good piece of meat, cold and tough ! Compared with all of the other RCs that I have eaten at and enjoyed thoroughly, I would NOT recommend this facility. It's a shame because the restaurant is exceptionally nice.",2,Dominic,Tallahassee
"Ruth's Chris was doing a vibrant business the day before Valentine's Day. But our Open Table reservation ensured our special booth next to the fireplace.  Perfect to hear Michael J. Thomas. Steaks: Filet with blue cheese crust and cowboy ribeye, perfect, taste, crust and med rare.  It's truly OK to finish the bone by hand!  Appetizer:  Wow, oysters Beinville; the waiter's description didn't do it justice; oysters, shrimp and other secrets!  Service:  We have always had great service at this Ruth's Chris.  Joey and his support team was awesome.  Mike is a quiet manager that ensures everything is running smoothly and everyone is smiling and happy. Even though we were stuffed, I still had to have the creme brulee, classic, spot on.  Also had the mushrooms as tasty complement to the steaks and the classic steakhouse creamed spinach.  Martinis to start; Silver Oak cab during; finished with cappuccino.  Wow. Even the car valets were smiling, gracious, and hustled.",5,odyssey4us,Las Vegas
"I called and booked a reservation for my family of 5. It was my wife's birthday and I wanted a special night for her. Well to say the least, you made it just that! You had the flowers on the table that I had ordered for her. You also sat us in the ""Wine Room"", to make her even feel even more special. Dinner and service were exceptional. Even  drop by, by Mike, to wish my wife a  Happy Birthday. Thanks for making us all feel welcome. and my wife so very happy on her special day....",5,DScott,Tallahassee
"Went for a romantic dinner with my fiancé and it turned out to be so much more! Dim lights, perfect food, beyond friendly service and a staff who simply cares!",5,Amazing,Tallahassee
"Jan 23, 2015 We made reservations for 6:30 p.m. on Friday evening the service was average.  We all ordered Filets.  Two were petite filets ordered butterfly cut - well done their choice on doneness  of which was accommodated .  Another petite was ordered with the ned rare to medium doneness - of which came out well done - it was tough and not eatable - the server offered a new steak but everyone would have been done with there dinner before I would have received the steak.  The sides that were ordered were exceptional.  I would have thought they would have not charged for that steak - it was left on the plate with one bite taken out of the steak.  Coming from the Midwest I know what good beef is.",3,Coralyn,Tallahassee
"Celebrated my husband's birthday at your Destin location again this year.  Our food and server were great as usual.  We will be back again to see you all next year.  Only sore spot of the evening was that because one person complained the music was too loud, and not thru her server , but in a rude way, we did not get to enjoy the music as we have in the past years.  Too bad when one person can control.  Perhaps she should have requested a quieter table or room.",5,SJDF,Tallahassee
"Very good location, great service and always excellent food.",5,cygnus,Tallahassee
Service was quite rude. Food was nice though.,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Went for our anniversary.  Was lovely!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
The tandoor nan and onion dip was delicious and perfect in proportion and taste. The sodas were new and exciting.  The rest of the dishes we tried were too salty for my taste.,3,Preeti,San Francisco

"We dined at Nix on a Saturday night.The space is comfortable and beautiful but not too formal  However the noise level is high especially towards the bar area Service was attentive . The wine list has some nice offerings   The food  was  ok to good and creative but not exceptional   certainly not worth a Michilein star by any means ,at least the portions were decent and not minuscule. We started with the hummus with Zahtar  and veggies .The hummus was smooth and flavorful but nothing I  could not and have replicated at home ( I must disclose I am a trained  natural foods chef/culinary instructor) we also ordered the  eggplant dip ,it was ok but could have benefited from  an additional smokier flavor  and a little less acidic finish .Cauliflower tempora was good  though it could have been a bit crunchier and was a bit over spiced ,heavy on the maybe sriracha? Any way a bit muddled  in flavor . The accompanying dip  for the cauliflower was bland  and indistinguishable .    Tempora  buffalo  cauliflower with a Vegan blue cheese  dip would have been a better alternative  or an addition  of a smoked paprika  based preparation would have worked  as well  For  main courses we had the shiitake mushrooms with polenta ( my favorite of the evening ) I added a poached egg on top .  it was perfectly seasoned , creamy polenta with juicy shiitakes . We also shared another  steaky mushroom entree with sun chokes nicely done  with good flavor .The big disappointment  of the night ( besides the dessert) the tofu skin pockets with a tomatillo sauce just did not work . the tofu skins were tough and the sauce and seasoning were an inedible mismatch of flavors   For dessert we  pre ordered the roasted  pineapple  with Vegan whipped cream , just ok    It would have been  better   Sliced and grilled in butter  or Vegan butter  with brown sugar  or coconut sugar and rum  (in 5 minutes  not 45) the Vegan whipped cream topping was delicious  .  Overall  Nix not worth the hefty $200 +For 3",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"A welcome addition to the neighborhood!  I'm an omnivore and I keep coming back because the food is inventive and delicious.  Great cocktails, service and an overall joyful experience.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

Fantastic service and very accomodating with my stroller! Food is fresh and delicious.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Nix is a lovely place - the white-painted bricks and subtle lighting makes or  a modern, relaxing environment.  The food is delicious. Innovative, beautifully presented and healthy. I also enjoyed a very tasty cocktail that I was reassured would be not too boozy for lunch. Service was very attentive.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"While the food was great, we had very bad service. We were not able to order additional drinks without spending a lot of time flagging down the waitress. In addition, once one course was finished it took about ~30 minutes for the next course to come out.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Everything we had was so delicious and creative! A total treat. The shiitake mushrooms totally took the cake and were such a great surprise - highly recommend. Great service, good wine, nice interior. All around, a great evening.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I went to dinner here with a friend who has strict religious dietary restrictions. They were extremely accommodating about asking the chef when she had questions about ingredients of certain dishes.  I am not a vegetarian, but I definitely enjoyed the food. Each dish was flavorful and well thought out. My only complaint was that the prices were high for small vegetarian dishes. Even without drinks, expect to spend atleast $45 on your meal, as the dishes are more of a sharing experience and you are likely to get multiple plates.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"We went to Nix as we wanted to experience a 'Michelin Star' meal at a reasonable price. We made a renovation which was easy through the website. The place was cozy and welcoming. The menu was well explained to us. Between the three of us we shared a dip, starter, two mains and two desserts. The starter was the best salad I have ever had but a simple mix of kale with flavours I cannot describe. The gnocchi was also the best I've had. So smooth. As we all didn't get full meals it was reasonably prices considering the quality and freshness of the food we were provided. I would definitely recommend this restaurant and would return.",4,Annabelle,New York Area
"The starter spreads, cauliflower buns and cocktails were to die for. Was less impressed with the shaved brussel sprout salad, as it was much too acidic. Needed to be balanced with a bit more sweetness and salt. Service was attentive and informative. Would return!",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Was disappointed as they ran out of Pea dumplings. Also, they didn't have much gluten free for a restaurant of there style .",2,brownbear1580,New York Area
Incredibly delicious and creative vegetarian food. Every perfectly cooked dish was bursting with sumptuous flavors.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"We love Nix. Delightful plates coming in smaller and larger options making it easy to share and taste a variety of offerings. Love the dips, the tandoori bread, the egg salad and gnocchi, just to name a few of their delights. Service was pleasant and attentive.",5,LadyLiberty,New York Area
Love to eat here!! Everything is always great!!,5,Yyygggrr,Indiana
"The first time my wife and  I went to Nix, it was for dinner. And the dinner was great. This time we went for brunch and I kind of wish we hadn't gone. I ordered the tofu scramble with butternut squash. The scramble was watery and the flavors were muddled at best. The worst part about it is that the dish is supposed to be a warm dish and the butternut squash was ice cold. My wife had an egg dish of some sort - which she seemed to enjoy.  The service was so slow though, it undid any good will she had for Nix. We waited a full 30 minutes for our appetizers and over an hour for our entrees to arrive. Anyway there are two things I'm not sure of: I'm not sure how they can/will retain their 1 Michelin star. And I'm not sure if I'll ever go back to Nix.",2,Foodie4Life,New York Area
"We've eaten at Nix twice at dinner, and this was our first brunch.  The food at dinner was nothing less than spectacular, while the weekend brunch was meh.  The service at dinner was professional, while the service at brunch was amateurish --- simple, meh food took ages to appear (even the cold plates) and attempts to explain half-hour delays in food and drink delivery were less than convincing.  A final insult was overcharging on the bill.  My heartfelt advice is to enjoy Nix in the evening, and leave the brunch offering to those who don't mind waiters and chefs-in-training.",4,jbNYC62,New York Area
So delicious and One of the best meals I've had in NYC!,5,ejbrackett,New York Area

Food was average and overly complicated- only the shiitake mushroom dish was a stand out.,3,OpenTable Diner,Philadelphia
"We were a late table, clearly we're being rushed to dine and get out. Server was sweet otherwise. Beautiful restaurant. Not huge portions, but filling.",4,SusA,New York Area
"Went to Nix for dinner in a mixed group of 2 vegetarians, 1 almost vegetarian, and two skeptical carnivores.  Everyone had a great meal, and the carnivores were pleasantly surprised by how delicious a good veg meal can be.  The dips were solid but certainly weren't the highlight for us (though the accompanying bread was very nice).  Pretty much everything else was solid-to-awesome (maybe 7-9 out of 10?), and the food was varied and all creative, from lighter item (salad-ish items like a crunchy brussel sprouts dish) to hearty ones (braised cabbage ""shoulder"" with mashed potatoes).  Would definitely go back for a special occasion.",5,Damian,New York Area
"Not going to lie. I was worried that I wouldn't be full, eating at a vegetarian place. This place has been receiving every award imaginable, so I decided to take the chance. Beautiful, vibrant cuisine. The days of bland, thoughtless vegetarian dishes  are long gone. I can't live without eating some sort of meat every meal, but everything was spot on, here! Vegetables were the star, and I totally forgot that I'm a full blooded meat eater. Yes, that good. Wine list is very smartly chosen, and staff is courteous and anticipate your every need. Ambience is sleek, and warm. Quiet but not too quiet. All in all, a wonderful experience. Will be back-!!",5,eatupdrinkupp,New York Area
"excellent and unusual veggie food. comfortable, elegant, great cocktails and fine, friendly service!! jane",5,jane,New York Area
"As a vegetarian, I appreciate the variety of delicious meal options. It is more of a tapas place than I realized (you get a few small plates and share). Overall, I would highly recommend if you're looking for a high quality vegetarian restaurant with a great atmosphere!",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"This was our fourth visit and our second brunch and it was disappointing.  We ordered beet hamburger and it felt like they put some pieces of beet on the grill for few minutes and served them on regular white flour bun. Boring.  The ""mad hatter"" was interesting  but the value for the size of this course was not proportional.  We expect more from ""NIX"".",4,Jambo,New York Area
The service was outstanding and the food was creative and delicious!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Vegan that doesn't punish you. I am not even vegetarian, and I love the food. Super creative and delicious.",5,NYCMcV,New York Area
It was a stressful day for me before I sat down at Nix.  Then the calm environment was evident to both my friend &amp; to me.  The food was served with thoughtful composition &amp; flavor.  Satisfying &amp; delicious. In fact I came back for lunch the following week with another friend &amp; it was again a successful eating experience.  I very much like it.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"When the room fills up, as it does every nite, the service gets a little less attentive. Vegetarians don't have to avoid oil ans sugar, and I feel there was too much oil in the dips and on the bread.  And I was aware of sugar (syrups) in a number of dishes, which I don't like. I did not like the tofu-skin pockets at all.  but the Braised cabbage was one of the greatest dishes I have ever had.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

Ruth Chris has the best steak around and I'm never disappointed in the steak. It is consistently EXCELLENT!  The wine list is always great. The sweets are always special.

"Our first visit to Ruth's Chris Steak House was to celebrate my husband's 60th birthday which I mentioned in the open table reservation. When we walked in the door and introduced ourselves he was immediately greeted with a ""Happy Birthday"" message! The rest of the evening followed suit! The food was great - from the ahi tuna appetizer to the filet mignon entre' to the bread pudding dessert with a happy birthday message on the plate. The price was not cheap - but we were expecting to pay for the wonderful food, service and atmosphere. We were not disappointed. I would highly recommend Ruth's Chris for any special occasion, or just a special evening out.",5,Nole2007,Orlando

We have been to 8 different Ruth's Chris restaurants. This is the only time that the service was not good. Our waitress did not come back and check on us like she should have. We asked for refills several times and she did not get them promptly and the last time she never even brought us our drinks which were not alcohol . The manager came by once to ask how everything was and we asked for refills then and still didn't get them for a while.  Ruth's Chris is our favorite special restaurant and we were disappointed with this visit because of the service.,4,Luv2eat,Tallahassee
"Their food was remarkable ! Steak so tender and juicy, lobster sweet and succulent and even their baked potato was exquisite :)~ Fine dinning at its best !!",5,Asystole,Tallahassee
"My husband and I came here for our 3rd anniversary dinner. The restaurant has a beautiful interior and we sat in a curved booth which was nice so we could sit side by side. As an appetizer we had the crab stuffed mushrooms which had a generous helping of crab meat, &amp; lobster bisque, which was extremely flavorful. I had the filet and lobster tail. My med-rare filet was cooked to perfection, extremely juicy, and melted in my mouth. The lobster tail was huge and perfectly cooked. My husbands bone in filet was to die for and unlike any steak we had ever tasted. The sides of garlic mashed &amp; asparagus were tasty and generous! Our amazing server, Eugene treated us to the bread pudding with whiskey sauce which was so moist and decadent.",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
The best all vegetarian restaurant I've been to. Would absolutely recommend (to meat eaters too!),5,ReviewLA,Atlanta
"Probably the best vegetarian restaurant that I've been to in years.  Mixed group of vegans/vegetarians/dedicated carnivores all agreed that food was simply outstanding.  Excellent service too.  Only negative was that music was extremely loud, making conversation for a party of 5 difficult.",4,bklyngrl,New York Area

I'm going again tomorrow. Can't wait. It looks like a hole in the wall, but when you enter, it's like being in an oasis of calm and beauty. GO! That's all. Just GO!",5,rinermo,New York Area
"As a special evening, my wife and I took our daughter for what was sure to be a fantastic steak dinner. We have visited this restaurant once before with an excellent experience. The specials were just what we wanted. The steaks and seafood were delicious. The service was impeccable and fully met all of our expectations. However....... A bar singer has been added to the mix. She is the type that strolls the restaurant, serenading with the diners. To ME, it felt intrusive. At one point, the singer left the room to interact with the party room. At that point, she had to make all the more noise since she was so far away from the accompanist and the speakers. The music at this point was out of sync and I just wanted to finish dinner and leave.",4,GregAndSuz,Cincinnati
"Of all the restaurants we experienced in Destin, this one had the worst service. I have enjoyed many fantastic meals at Ruth's Chris around the country, and the food at this location was excellent as always, but the service was out of character by far. Three of six drinks were wrong, the wine I ordered was forgotten, and when it was finally served we had finished our meals. We never saw our waiter after placing the order until after the meal. It was a quiet Sunday night, and it appeared that there were plenty of wait staff. There did not seem to be any manager on duty, and if there was, we never saw it. There are other excellent restaurants in Destin where your experience will be much more pleasant.",2,OpenTable Diner,Washington DC
"There is no other place to dine if you are looking for delicious prime steak. Ruths Chris always comes through for us when we are in the mood for steak and they never fail to prepare it just as we request. We have never sent a steak back to the kitchen. The Oysters Rockefeller were an added treat that were delicious too. We brought our son the other night for his farewell ""back to college"" dinner and everything was delicious.",5,odyssey4us,Las Vegas

"I was working in Destin for just the day and I brought my son for company on the trip. He is such an amazing boy that I decided to treat us both to a nice dinner. So when we decided on steak Ruth'sChris seemed like the obvious choice. He's had the benefit if dining at nice places his whole life and the evening here was one that we will both remember. The food was outstanding! Our filets were perfect, salads were fresh and the sides, green beans with roasted garlic and fries were even memorable. The entertainment made the night!",5,Shelliebelle,Atlanta
Just love the food and the service--always outstanding,5,lovesteak,Tallahassee
"Bone in filet was incredible. Nice service, atmosphere, and overall meal.",5,DanS,Orlando
"We eat at Ruth's Chris often, as it is in walking distance. The service and the food are always perfect. The petite fillet is a must have. The crabatini appetizer is amazing. The,lamb chops and the tuna are also excellent choices. We really like the new East Bar and we enjoy dining on the patio, also.",5,Diane,Tallahassee
Steak was over done and they don't accept gift cards anymore,3,Garry,Tallahassee
"Ruth's Chris, as always, does not disappoint - from the crowd of energetic, uniformed valets at the front door, to the smiling greeter who opens the door, to the polite hostess who immediately seats you - and on to the busser who keeps the water glasses filled, a knowledgeable and attentive waiter, which all combine for an elegant and refined dining experience. We were celebrating our anniversary and were treated to a special dessert, complete with ""Happy Anniversary"" written in caramel sauce on the plate. We were wished a ""Happy Anniversary"" by all our waitstaff and by the greeter as she opened the door when we were leaving. We always enjoy Ruth's Chris and will surely return to this one next time we are in Destin.",5,Bamamom,New York Area
"You can't go wrong with the food at Ruth Chris. We started with the lobster bisque and escargot. Both were excellent. Their steaks are the absolute best and you will want seconds on the bread and butter. The potatoes augratin are amazing.  The atmosphere is dated and ready for a remodel, but other than that its worth the money!!",4,dougandcarol,Tallahassee
The wait staff seemed a bit stuffy and scripted. We ordered the surf and turf and it was outstanding.,4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Our brunch at Nix was excellent. The decor is minimalistic and beautiful, and the atmosphere is lively without being overwhelming.  The food was amazing, and the pricing was reasonable, which can be hard to find in the city.",5,David,New York Area
The very best of service and food!!! Can not find anything better!!! GREAT!!!!,5,OpenTable Diner,Toronto
It is what Ruth's Chris should be. Excellent.,5,DavidS,Minneapolis
Though it is a chain restaurant it is still good for special occasions or just for cocktails with friends.,3,joenotso,Tallahassee
"My wife and I were there for our 35th. anniversary as usual, the food was excellent! we split a strip much to our surprise we were charged $90 for the steak at my wife's urging, I left without question but I will not be back!",4,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
"Food was great, service was excellent and we all had a great time!",4,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
Excellent - service was great and food like always was amazing,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I made a reservation at Nix for just myself while on a work trip to NYC.  I'm a vegetarian and I can't believe it took me this long to discover this neighborhood gem.  Hands down the best vegetarian meal I've ever had in the city. The staff was very friendly and helpful, and the food was fantastic.  Perfect for sharing with two people, slightly on the pricier side but absolutely justified by the quality and presentation.  It might not be in your everyday budget, but if you're a vegetarian you should absolutely treat yourself to the experience when you have the chance. Even if you aren't vegetarian the selection was delicious across the board and anyone could enjoy it. They also had a great cocktail list with thoughtful, creative updates to classic cocktails.  Hands down my new favorite restaurant in NYC, I can't wait to go back!",5,MistyBaily,Los Angeles
"Great food - awesome innovative vegetarian dishes.  Must get the egg salad.  Vibe was a little stuffy and servers, while good, were ""trying too hard"".  I'm sure they'll get it down",4,NYClocal,New York Area
"Nix is a nice addition to the tough NY dining scene. The atmosphere is pleasant, with plenty of booths for only two people. Service is friendly and efficient, and prices are reasonable for NYC.   The highlight however is the fresh vegetable centric food. They offer most items on the menu as vegetarian and even vegan. The fresh bread with a variety of dips and fresh cut vegetables were excellent starters, and the mushroom entere was a stand out.",4,Fussy,New York Area
Incredible experience and incredible food! We relied on our server to help us make decisions and she was very honest and gained our trust. I will definitely recommend as we as return!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Excellent except for the beet burger- basically a roasted beet on dry bread,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
I'm not a vegetarian but I would absolutely go back the food was that good. Good place for a group to do family style. Everything was delicious and good portion sizes.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
I love vegetables but didn't know veggies could be this filling and inventive. Quite delicious.,5,luv2dine,New York Area
"Really nice and friendly staff, mature crowd and perfect for a date or a small group. Food was exceptional, very tasty and easy to share.  I will go back for another special occasion.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
in the middle of our dinner two friends wanted to join us and we were quickly brought to a table to accommodate the larger group!  this is our new favorite restaurant!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Nix was good but didn't live up to the expectations we came in with. The service in general was a little off. Food was good but not exceptional.,3,LalithaR,New York Area
Tried about a third of the menu with a group of friends. Not one item was less than spectacular! Many vegan options as well.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
The food was delicious and creative. The wine list wasn't extensive but thoughtful. I enjoyed everything about the meal. Best vegetarian restaurant in the area.,5,Penn,New York Area
"Very nice place, good food. But  balance between price and quality is not that good. And: it is so noisy",3,OpenTable Diner,London
"Delicious food, amazing service and lovely ambience. Would highly recommend! We had a brilliant evening. Thank you!",5,Sheilz81,New York Area
Most delicious vegetarian menu - all bites were delicious but the lebna and gnocchi were our most favorite!,5,LindseyS,New York Area
WAY too loud even after repeated requests to lower volume on music. The food is creative and tasty but portions very small and overpriced. I went home and had a second dinner.... and I weigh 99 lbs! I won't return any time soon.,3,Lynnf,Denver
"Notable wine list that always hits a home run regardless of the price point.  Andrea the som, is articulate and her enthusiasm is contagious.    The vegetable forward menu is such a wonderful break from a meat-heavy change of scenery.  My carnivore and vegan friends all enjoy Nix.  Outstanding dishes were the jicama salad, pea dumplings.  Brunt broccoli was nice but would have been better without the cheese.  Gnocchi was also lovely.    We didn't understand the hype around the cauliflower tempura.  Just a heavy, fat-soaked, sugary bomb with dense white Korean buns.  The Shitake cacio e pepe was just a giant bowl of heavy sauce with some mushrooms floating around in it.    We'll be back, because of the wine and the service.  But the menu could use some nuance.  It felt like chubby white men were in the back trying to make vegetables taste good using cheese as an umami bomb, instead of the exploring the freshness and sophistication that a vegetable-forward menu could serve up.  E for effort C for execution.",4,LIsaL,New York Area
Wonderful meal. Inventive cuisine. Great service.  Great drinks.,4,OpenTable Diner,Los Angeles
Food was good but mains took ages,2,OpenTable Diner,London
The food was good but nothing exceptional. Nice place for lunch.,3,OpenTable Diner,London
"The food was okay with some nice flavors, however nothing particularly standout. My friend also commented that he felt a lot f the food was a bit too salty. The worst part of the experience was the service which made us feel very rushed. My friend and I were taking our time ordering each next course, yet the wait staff came over almost every two minutes or so to check on if we were ready to order which was incredibly disruptive to our experience. This happened throughout the evening and felt like they were trying to rush us, even though there we're no crowds waiting for tables. Felt annoyingly like they were hovering. I wouldnt go here again but wouldn't tell someone not to go here given the prices aren't  so bad.",3,kelp1001,New York Area
"Great food, drinks and service!",4,Isabel,London
"Even having a reservation for dinner we had to wait 30 minutes for our table. Pay to eat vegetables and delayed reservation could make us never come back again, HOWEVER they tried to make it up not charging the wine and sending many dishes as  compliment. At the end we forgot how stressful it was to get our table and enjoyed dinner. The shitake cacio e pepe is DELICIOUS!",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The food here is astounding. The kitchen understands flavors &amp; textures and delivers meals to the table unlike any you've had before.  We ordered six dishes, an app (naan &amp; a couple of dips), 2 starters, 2 entrees, and a dessert to split. Of course, in fact we split everything. Bread, dips, curries, veggies, all were just outstanding.",5,matt,New York Area
"The Shiitake “cacio e pepe” and potato gnocchi were both unreal. Top 5 meals of my life for sure. The pear &amp; cardamom soda was excellent and our waiter (Cody?) was great. The only downside was that we were seated against the wall under an air vent and it was very, very cold. Excellent experience aside from that.",5,AJJJ,New York Area
WAY TOO NOISY! I won't be dining here again. I had to yell to be heard by my friend sitting directly across from me.,3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Best vegetarian food in NYC, in my opinion. Dishes were creative and flavorful. Service was awesome. Great concept and vibe.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"We went to Nix to celebrate a friend's birthday on Sunday at lunchtime.  It was pretty crowded!  The main courses were very creative -- lovely salads, a delicious beet burger -- and delicious.  I also liked the fact that each table had both fizzy and still water.",5,MitchellCohn,San Francisco
"This place was magical. The staff was incredibly kind, patient, and some of the best professional staff you will find in NYC.  Despite a packed place on a Saturday night, my wife and I felt pampered by both food and service. Worth the price for this amazing experience. Hope to come here for more than just special occasions in the future.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
We were seated quickly and the service overall was very high quality. All the food was delicious and creative vegetarian fare that was hearty and amazingly also light.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Came for birthday dinner- food was excellent. My boyfriend and I are not vegetarians or vegans and loved it. Highlights were the egg salad, burnt broccoli, cauliflower tempura and potato gnocchi. Will definitely. E returning.",5,HeatherK,New York Area
"The food was delicious, the staff was friendly and not overly attentive (which I like), and the noise level was not library quit nor sports bar loud. I had a great first experience.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"We went for brunch and had different dips that were delectable. The egg dishes were fine. The drinks were nice. It was pretty, clean, and not too loud. If you are vegetarian or vegan, this is for you! Skip the veggie sausage.",4,ctoddmem,New York Area
Such a nice place for my dad's birthday brunch!! Everyone from carnivore father to vegan sister had good options. :):):),5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
yummy and simple. perfect for a weekday lunch in  NYC.,4,peytonweber,New York Area
"My third time and it just gets better with each visit.  Tried the onion dip this time, I could eat a vat.  Cauliflower tempura buns must not be missed!",5,judyz,New York Area
"Made reservations for my friends and I for my birthday dinner Wednesday night. We showed up early and they happily seated us right away, and the service was good throughout the night. Food was excellent and very inventive. As a vegetarian I was glad to have an upscale meal and I can't wait to go back! PS gnocchi is a MUST!",5,Carol,New York Area
Nix was a fantastic experience from the food to the patient service. We enjoyed the Brussel Sprout salad and the Gnocchi the most. Highly recommended for vegetable lovers and very reasonably priced.,5,Shabli,New York Area
"As usual, Ruth's Chris did not disappoint.  What a wonderful New Year's dinner.",5,Kathsscrn,Palm Springs
"We spend winters in the Destin area and have a number of friends whom we frequently dine with.  When we consider a fine steak restaurant someone always says, “If I want steak, I know a great place back home.”  Thus, my wife and I decided the two of us would dine alone at Ruth’s in Destin FL for a special occasion.  We arrived a few minutes early for our reservation and were seated immediately.  The restaurant is elegant and nicely decorated for the holidays.  The wine selection is very good both by the bottle and the glass.  The menu offers a nice selection.  We ordered the crab au gratin appetizer which I would not recommend.  It was not warm enough and the bread served with it is strictly average.  My wife chose the house salad and I had the wedge.  Both salads were excellent.  The steak selection is outstanding and most are 16 ounces, which is slightly larger than those offered by other prime steak houses.  I had the ribeye which was perfectly prepared and had excellent taste.  My wife had the filet and lobster tail.  She thought the filet was exceptional but the lobster tail a little over seasoned.  Service is excellent but perhaps a little rushed for us as we finished diner in only 2 ½ hours.  At the conclusion of the evening my wife and I agreed that Ruth’s is a fine restaurant but if we want steak we know a great place back home.",5,visitingfisherman,Cincinnati
"Our family visited Ruth's Chris in Destin for Christmas Eve dinner and had a great time.  The restaurant was warm, inviting, and upscale; the service was spot on; and the food was perfectly prepared.  It's hard to beat an expertly prepared sizzling filet on a 500 degree plate, and to that end all four of us had the filet this time around accompanied by steamed green beans that were a bit undercooked for my tastes, au gratin potato, garlic mashed potato, and broccoli au gratin.  We started the meal with a delightful salad.  I highly recommend Ruth's Chris for a special mean while in Destin.",5,Modiecast,Kansas City
Deliciously expensive dining.  Food and service were all you could ask for.  Not an everyday place to eat on our budget but certainly worth the money on special occasions.,5,Year45,Tallahassee

Wonderful night out for adults. Dinner was the beginning of our family Christmas shopping weekend. Delicious food and excellent service.,5,detournoproblem,Birmingham

"We were celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary,  and Ruth's Chris was an excellent choice.  Excellent wine, service and food.",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"My daughter and I decided to splurge on dinner one night while on vacation and we were so, so glad we did.  Everything was amazing about the dining experience. The food was top notch and the wait staff amazing.  I could go back in a minute!  Well worth every dime we paid!",5,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
Perfect for a special occasion. Enjoy the fact that you can hear what your companions are saying.  No loud music to have to talk over.  Michael's sax adds a wonderful touch to the atmosphere.,5,Barb,Tallahassee
Outstanding wait staff! Part of 3- all had different steaks-prepared 3 different ways-all were delicious! Will return next trip to Destin.,5,goodfoodfinder,Atlanta
"Once again Ruth's Chris has never let us down.  The food and service was superb, unsurpassed in quality.  We have dined all over the world and nothing compares to Ruth's Chris for consistency.  We have decided that your establishment is the most beautifully arranged.  It was not so dark as the others always seem to be.  I had the special, the grouper with lump crab meat and béarnaise sauce and it was delicious.  The NY strip that my husband had was served Pittsburgh style just as he ordered it with the perfect sear yet remained rare in the middle.  His shrimp cocktail was delicious and so was the onion soup I enjoyed. The dessert of creme brûlée was just as delicious as always.  Ah, but we love being able to depend on consistent perfection!",5,Tinydiny,Mississippi
"A nice respite from tourist traps. Good food, excellent service. I go there every time I am in Destin for a nice night out.",5,BigEdAtlanta,Atlanta
Server was super pleasant when we saw him. Martini made incorrectly and had to be remade. My Filet was overlooked which surprised me as I have been to this restaurant in many cities and never had a food or service flaw. Now to the positives....the fried green tomato appetizer was Awesome!! Everyone else enjoyed their steaks and cooked to the requested temperature. The au gratin and creamed spinach sides were also delicious! The manager personally apologized and addressed the issue with my steak which I appreciated! The acoustics are not great. There was a VIP table on the other side of the restaurant who was loud and we could hear every word they said. I would try it again as this is atypical of my previous experiences as I mentioned!,3,Foodie,New Orleans
"I have been dinning at Ruth Chris of Destin for almost 8 years and everything is always perfect. From Michal J. Thomas, the entire staff and management team always treat me and my children like family. Ask for Tara if she isn't there re book your reservation.  Can never say enough how much Ruth Chris has opened my eyes on food, wine and proper service. The price and service will match the price.",5,BossRoss,Orlando
Enjoy this restaurant but tried to use a rewards dining check and our waiter took it to manager who said they don't accept them!!!  We have been using opentable to book here for several years and this is first time I tried to use a check here and no go!!  I would expect better from management.,3,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"We entertained 10 last Friday night and the food was fantastic, the service was perfect and we all had a great time.",5,YumYum,Jacksonville
"This is a must do in Destin, FL. Great everything! WE always have a wonderful experience.",5,Julia,Philadelphia
"There was 8 of us, and all but one said their steaks were good. My steak was suppose to be medium, but was chewy like shoe leather. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful, and saw how tough my steak was, yet... Didnt offer a refund. I spoke to the manager on way out and he refunded for the one steak. Remainder of meal was excellent... But, this did not meet the usual experience I get at Rith's Chris... Which is normally my favorite steak house.",4,JL2003,Memphis
"Great Place for a Great Steak cooked just right and served sizzling, stuffed mushroom's, cobb salad and potato's au gratin are also very good, you pay for what you get a Great Steak and sides. Worth a trip.",4,bbc1013,New Orleans
"Ruth's Chris is always a great spot for a nice, quiet dinner. ",4,Tony,Atlanta
"We dine here every time we visit Destin. The service and food are always consistently excellent. Makes me hungry just to think about it!  On this trip, we had an issue with the parking attendant. We did not tip him when he took our vehicle to park it. I guess he thought we were not going to tip. After our meal, he retrieved our vehicle and he received his tip. Once in the car, we realized he had turned the radio up blaring out the tunes and had set the air on 60 degrees and blasting!  He will not keep us from returning to one of our favorite restaurants! ",5,Ooolala123,New Orleans
The restaurant was very elegant and the service was great but the food was just alright. For the price I expected exceptional. Overall it was a good experience and I recommend trying it. You will feel like you are dining like a king or queen even if the food doesn't taste like it.,4,ElegantFoodie,Hawaii
We have never had anything less than a great dining experience at Ruth's Chris Steakhouse.  What else can I say.,5,DrJimT,Louisville
"Ruth's Chris has amazing steaks, sides,  and appetizers. It is not the regular beach restaurant. It's fancier. So, pull out a cute summer dress and go have an amazing steak! Wonderful service that you can't beat anywhere. ",5,alimel,Orlando
"In Destin multiple times,but I can honestly say this was the worst visit. Main waiter,Robin, not very attentive, disappeared for long periods of time? They also must have a New Mgr, not the same from the last two years. Never saw him engage anyone, walked past our table and others multiple times, totally ignored the patrons. This restaurant was NOT busy. Empty tables all around us in the main dining room. The young man who assisted our main waiter, was absolutely delightful, Jerry was attentive, knowledgeable, perhaps he should be a waiter? He was definitely a ""bright spot"" of the evening, along with the young man who provided the entertainment. We could have stayed and listened to him all night!We love Ruth's Chris, will always be patrons!",4,DustysMom,Cincinnati
Ruth Chris's always has great food and it delivered for Easter brunch. The noise level was a little higher than I would've liked. They sat us by a large group of children (not sure why as there was plenty of seating open). I would've asked to be moved if I knew it would be that loud. The wait staff was on their usual game at my visit. My husband asked for some more bread and did not get it until almost when the main course was served. I ran out of my drink for awhile before it was refilled. The food was spectacular! I would give it a second try since this isn't a usual for the restaraunt.,5,kmorton,Tallahassee
"Steaks were delicious! Great wine selection. Our entire meal was simply spectacular. Service was great and the atmosphere was upbeat, but elegant. We had six people in our party and we all had a great dining experience.",5,Alabama,Washington DC
We had an amazing dining experience! My 13 year old dauhhter and her friend tried escargot and both loved it!,5,Vacadestin,Tallahassee
"Just a great place for an extra special dining experience. Appetizers, filets, sides, desserts, and one drink each for about $80 per person. The quality of the food, service, and ambience makes this a great place to dine for a special occasion. I highly recommend this great restaurant for any special occasion!",4,GPop,Tallahassee
"Overall a great dinning experience my first choice to eat on a special occasion or anytime, I have been dinning at Ruth Chris steakhouse for the pass 9yrs. I enjoy every moment. Keep up the good job  Thank You, Joya,N",3,JOYA,Tallahassee
"We come here every year for Valentine's Day. The steaks and sides are wonderful, the service is great and the experience is first rate.",4,Daniel,Tallahassee
"We came here for my wife's birthday and were certainly not disappointed. Our server, Eugen, guided and made recommendations throughout our dining experience. Appetizers of escargot and crab stuffed mushroom caps, entree of the cowboy ribeye paired with garlic mashed potatoes and roasted garlic green beans and a wonderful comped dessert of the chocolate explosion, nothing was less than magnificent.  Our server and his helper were very efficient, yet allowed us plenty of time for private moments. Never rushed, nonetheless the meal progressed at a comfortable clip. Drinks, appetizers, main course and dessert. Never rushed but always attended to. We could not have asked for more.  A fine, quality steakhouse.",5,Jnjinnc,Tallahassee
"We loved the wine room for a group of 6. Very private. We all had different steaks, the T bone for two, ribeye and fillet. All were done to perfection. We shared sides of salad, baked potatoes and vegatables. All food was served hot. Our server was gracious and polite. I would recommend Ruth Chris for any special occasion.",5,hatae2cook,Tallahassee
"Frankly, I've had better steaks for less than the price of those at Ruth's Chris. I ordered my steak to be cooked medium- it was perfect. My boyfriend's steak however, was overcooked. He had ordered for his to be cooked medium and they made it well done. Hindsight, we should have sent it back, but honestly the restaurant made us very uncomfortable. We were sat in the very middle of the room so any request made felt like all eyes were turned toward us. Also, everything is a la carte so any sides or extras must be ordered separately from the steaks; the sides cost $9-13 per side- absolutely ridiculous. If you go to Ruth's Chris, expect to pay $55 to $80 per head for good food that can be gotten elsewhere for a better price.",2,panhandlefoodie,Tallahassee
Robin made our night out extra special by being super attentive to our needs. We have never had a negative dining experience at Ruth Chris.,5,fanofRuthChris,Tallahassee
"I tried NIX because of it's Michelin star. Food was fairly good, but I did not think it was as great as many of the reviews out there. Perhaps I'm in the minority, but the cauliflower dish they are famed for was odd - like a reddish barbecue sauce over cauliflower. The dips were nice with GREAT pita, but not over the top or any better than other places. We spent about $60 for lunch, with sharing 3 small plates, which was a lot for what you got. I would not return, but maybe it's because I'm not a vegetarian so don't need to go to such a place for good food.",3,Cathie,New York Area
"Everything was delicious, especially the hummus and squash blossoms. Staff very courteous and attentive, left feeling satisfied and with the intention of coming back in the future.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"My first time going to Nix and it was delicious. The sommelier, Andrea, was very friendly and the wine she helped us select was perfect! Be sure to ask for her knowledge when you visit. :)",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I have dined and brunched at Nix quite a few times and have been very happy, especially with the dinner offerings.  I hope that the evening of Friday 6/2 was just an off-night for the kitchen.  But too many dishes were not up to par that evening.  The bread and dips we chose were delicious.  But my friend had an asparagus dish that was inedible because it was so heavily salted.  The maitre d offered to bring a low-salt replacement, which was less salty but still overly salty.  My jicama salad dressing was excessively citrusy, and the shitake cacio e pepe, which I've loved there on several previous occasions was under-seasoned.  My hope is that the chef will take note of these problems and correct them so I can return and enjoy the Nix cuisine.",3,perfectdiner,New York Area
Exquisite food! Small portions and pricey but every bite is delicious.,5,RealFineFood,Dallas
A wonderful vegetarian restaurant.   Marvelous quality and taste.  The people who work there are lovely.,5,Virginia,New York Area
One of the most memorable meals I have had in the past few years. The mushroom polenta and pineapple dessert are to die for. The servers are very attentive and extremely nice people.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
VERY EXPENSIVE VEGGIE FOOD. NOTHING SPECIAL. Almost $200 with one drink each. Not my idea of value,3,brandyandval,New York Area
"Another great meal at Nix. Not only is the food consistently creative and vibrant, the service is excellent. Both the manager and the waiter were helpful in making sure we enjoyed everything we ordered. As a vegetarian or vegan, or just someone who loves vegetables, you can't go wrong here. Best broccoli ever!",5,VEGGIEFAN,New York Area
Super great! I don't know how else to describe the experience here. The food was excellent and service was top notch. I can't recommend this restaurant any higher. Great options for vegans and other dietary restrictions.,5,Vegan4Life,San Francisco
"What a fabulous experience! ""Are you dining vegan tonight"" are the magic words every vegan wants to hear from a server whilst being handed a fully vegan menu. I was overjoyed to have a naan bread for the first time in 2 years with some delicious dips. Then my husband and I shared the pea dumplings and the asparagus, followed by the cauliflower tempura and vegan pockets. And chocolate pudding and desert wine to finish!   The service was excellent and the restaurant is beautiful- perfect ambiance.  It's so difficult to find vegan places where one can truly indulge in a fine dining experience and this was it.  My only complaint is that they don't have a sister restaurant in San Francisco because it's desperately needed there!!",5,CatMog,San Francisco
"Food was very creative and just as delicious.  Staff were pleasant, polite and thoughtful.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Delicious vegetarian food! Great place if you love sharing dishes :)  Polenta fries are to die for, make sure you leave space for desert and try nun's puffs!",5,sbvk,New York Area
"We are lucky this is right in our hood. And our hood includes Union Square, where Nix makes great use of the veggies from the green market. Great wine list and service too. We are not vegetarians but will be going back.",4,Bengoshi,New York Area
"Outstanding vegetarian cuisine.  They urge you to order more than most people might want as the dishes are substantial, so take it easy and order more as needed.  The glass wine list is on the 'precious' side and does not list vintages, but does have interesting selections.  Dips, gnocchi and roasted corn salad were particularly outstanding.",4,porker,Atlanta
This was my second time to Nix.  First time I had dinner the second time brunch.  Both visits were perfect.  The meals are unique and delicious.  I highly highly recommend.  My new favorite in NYC and not just for vegetarian food.,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"It was great from the beginning. Since we arrived at the place, 'Til the very last bite of food and last sip of drink, it was amazing. The only problem was not finding the lucuma sorbet, but their vegetarian food is the best I've tried so far",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Fresh food , lovely room,  good service , and innovative take on vegetarian à la India",4,argoslovesfood,Toronto

Amazing creative vegetarian food that is presented like artwork.   Varied flavors and seasonings are applied to  the beautifully prepared vegetables to make you feel you have traveled to other parts of the world.,4,Sylvia,New York Area
The food was good but the portions were very small. I had to go home and find something else to eat.,3,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
"The outside looks different from the inside, and I was worried that I've taken my mom to the wrong place. It be helpful if they could make the sign up either a little bigger or make it stand out a little better because we almost past it.  We were both surprised to see people beckoning others and to the restaurant for brunch and, that there was they had people by the door ready to take reservations(we were on time) it was so close to the door so it was unexpected but we relished not having to make a line.  Before I go on about anything else I want to make it clear, that this is my first time ever coming here let alone with anyone else. Anyway we kept having to change our orders because the food you wanted to order it was apparently out of stock(we were there for brunch so it was 2:15) even though it wasn't very late. The applied to our drinks as well.  Now while our waiter was courteous, we didn't see him much after ordering and got our food(we needed tissues) our brunch was slowly coming to an end. We were drinking, ordering coffee, planning on what to do and where to go next and that was taking a little bit of time so we ordered and talked about it. It was agreed we would go to a café next for a little bit of dessert(Beignets)and I think I'll wait on my waiter was easedropping because he appeared very suddenly camouflaging and then BAM!!!  (Seriously scared the chiz out of me) I knew it didn't look like he was going to leave in fact he kept making rounds to make it clear I think that he wanted us to go.   Long story short we ended up ordering something we didn't really want and we hand to take it home too. It didn't taste anything like what we wanted and wish he didn't mention it.  Lastly I had to use common sense to find a bathroom, and there were no symbols  anywhere to indicate if they were gender neutral or anything they were just completely blank the doors and walls(I think it'd really help because I wasn't the only one who was confused) since they blended in",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The food is good not something you'd drool over or come back for but worth a try. The manager though is the rudest and so unprofessional. As we were leaving the restaurant waiting for our friend (who was still inside) outside by the window, we realized Ed Norton was sitting by the window so we merely had a subtle look and the manager came out buzzing us off like we were some bees. He hadn't realized we were actually lunching inside and that we 'normal regular people' have seen 'ET celebrity people' before. What a shame.",1,Gogo,London
One of the few restaurants I can return to again and again and never be disappointed.,5,Manhattandweller,New York Area
Outstanding! One of the best vegan/ vegetarian restaurants in the world!,5,shewolf,Melbourne / VIC
"We had a fantastic experience dining at Nix. The food was amazing, and the service was excellent. The three of us shared a number of dishes: my favorites were the jicama salad and the cacio e pepe polenta. We also had the warmed avocado curry, egg salad, burnt broccoli, and pea dumplings. For dessert we had the tandoori pineapple and coconut tapioca. The tapioca wasn't my fav but the pineapple was great. Would highly recommend Nix for a nice dinner, definitely make a reservation.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Delicious veggie meal in the city. All you would expect from a Michelin starred restaurant. However, for the price they are charging for some dishes (with no protein), you'd expect double the serving size. Tastes are nuanced and divine. Come for a special meal with that bougie vegan/veggie friend - this is a true treat. You may leave hungry though!",4,JasonO,New York Area
Unique menu with great options for vegans. Loved the atmosphere and the service was great!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The food was very special and the ambiance was lively. Our service was just below parr for the price and prestige of the restaurant. Literally the table behind us sat down 20 minutes later, ordered the same dishes and left significantly before us.",4,JLovesFood,New York Area
"The food overall was great! My favorite was the Cauliflower tempura and the Tandoor asparagus. We also ordered Tandoor bread (the regular and vegan options), to go along with 3 dips: Avocado, Red pepper and hummus. The dips were good but not as exciting or unique as I had heard they were. The pea dumplings were delicious and we also had the shittake mushrooms and the trumpet mishroom dishes. The service trought the meal was great, but when we were done eating and just chatting and catching up our table got cleaned extra quick and one of the hostesses came by our table and circled around us looking at us in a very akward way- clearly sending a message that if we weren't eating we needed to head out- I thought this was completely unecessary and unprofessional at a Michelin star restaurant. That last part kind of ruined the amazing experience we had until then.",4,Yonit,Miami
Excellent and creative vegetarian fare in an upscale casual setting. Perfect place for both vegetarians and their skeptical friends because the food is delicious!,4,SarahG,New York Area
Vegan heaven and great for meat eaters too.,5,Marcnbarry,New York Area
"I have had some great meals here, the experience and pleasing of the palette have always made each trip quite enjoyable. I really enjoyed my last visit but the food wasn't consistent, delicious but slightly inconsistent. I ordered almost the same things (creature of habit). E.g.,  the cauliflower Korean bun dish tasted like it contained too much ketchup and the tofu skins was less delicate and filled with simple quinoa. Maybe I've eaten here too many times and/or I need to give it a break until the novelty is back. Cocktails are always great.",3,Djain,New York Area
Great veg restaurant for the non-veg (me). Very appealing food for this foodie!,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Excellent food, service and ambiance. In fact, to us this kind of vegetarian cooking was a new revelation. We especially recommend the Rutabaga, and will definitely return. Its far more than a neighborhood restaurant.",4,Henri,New York Area
Nix delivers again and again for our special occasions. Service is impeccable and the veggie forward options are impressively creative.,5,CandT,New York Area
"Chose this for a friends bday lunch -  neither of us are vegetarian but appreciate inventive vegetarian cuisine.  There was so much I loved. Our summery cocktails - he got something w mango and a kick and I had a refreshing vodka and cucumber concoction. We ordered more because it all sounded so good. The ceaser salad using seaweed instead of sardines, the cauliflower tempura, the better burger .. the peach dessert yum. Everything tasted even better than it sounded. Our server was friendly and helpful with the menu and the space was chic and well designed. The clientele seemed sophisticated and artistic. I will be back for dinner!",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Great Place and good menu. I enjoyed the dinner even if I'm not vegetarian. The only problem was the use of the spices, Indian and Moroccan inspired, that gave the same finishing to all plates I tasted.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Food was really delicious. Richer than I expected for a vegetarian restaurant. The ambiance was nice, but we were there at 7:30 and while the lights were low and the place was comfortable, there were some families with really small kids (a couple with two young ones threatening a meltdown right near us) which detracted a little from it being a perfect date setting.  Maybe we should have gone a bit later in the evening.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Great food, beautiful space, warm and friendly staff.",5,Superb,Philadelphia
Overall the experience was alright. The service was not top notch - drinks didn't come till we were into the light eats. The starter Tandoor bread was really good and after that the cauliflower tempura was alright.,3,PRASH,New York Area
"Outstanding food, great service.  I can't say enough good things about the food at Nix.  They have both vegetarian and vegan menus.  We ordered only from the vegan menu and everything was so good.  A true gourmet feast!  Prices are quite reasonable especially for New York, though you could run up the bill since you will really want to try everything on the menu.   Excellent service.  Very nice ambiance, though we were there on a busy night so it did get a bit noisy.  Definitely make reservations well in advance.",5,Urbangirl,New England
Outstanding restaurant on all counts.  We haven't had such a delicious and exciting meal in a very long time.  The service was great and the food was epic.  Worth every penny.  We would definitely come here again.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Upscale vegetarian. Special and creative. Tasty, Pricey morsels. Fashionable crowd. A fun and enjoyable culinary experience.",4,ericaC,New York Area
"It was my second time there and I would definetely go back.  Some dishes were delicious, some I thought had too much dressing/sauce.  Overall, the dishes are delicious with a lot of flavor but wouldn't mind if they take it down a notch for cleaner flavor in some cases,",4,JJCC,Los Angeles
"Simply put, Nix was outstanding. The service was fantastic and the food was incredible. Everything was well thought out and executed effortlessly. I couldn't get enough of the pea dumplings.",5,JRube,Vancouver
"Absolutely delicious food, and wonderful service. Their vegan options are great, and the atmosphere is lovely. I highly recommend this place!",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Felt as is the food was underwhelming and the server was disinterested.,4,OpenTable Diner,New England
"My girlfriend and I come to NY a couple times a  year together for work and we make one night a special night for her and I at Nix and we are always are thrilled. The food is fresh and delicious, innovative and perfect for sharing.  A must do when in NY.",5,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
"WE LOVED IT!  MY DAUGHTER IS VEGAN, BUT ISN'T REALLY INTERESTED IN THE ""MEAT SUBSTITUTE"" FOODS IN EVIDENCE AT MOST VEGAN/VEGETARIAN RESTAURANTS.  THE FOOD WAS ELEGANT AND DELICIOUS, AND REALLY CELEBRATED VEGETABLES.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"My wife and I wanted to dine at a vegetarian Michelin star restaurant during our trip to New York and are happy that we chose Nix. The atmosphere is nice and cozy and the food creative and outstanding. Our favourite dish was pea dumplings with ginger and scallion oil. The dumplings were smooth and silky and the broth so full of flavour. I give 4 stars to service because the servers were a bit too eager to take our plates while we had not yet finished our food. Three different servers in a row wanted to take our plates while we tried to enjoy the last bites of our gorgeous dishes. That is, however, my only complaint.",5,RudolfO,Raleigh
Excellent Father's Day brunch!!!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"My girlfriend and I are both veg and we love a good vegan joint. We caught wind of Nix last minute and they had a few reservations left so we made our way there. I'll say this now, the potions look small, but we ordered one item from each section of the menu (starter, salad, meal and desert) and walked away the most satisfied without being stuffed I think I've ever been.  The food was delicious and the servers were both pleasant and knowledgeable. Would go definitely go back.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Amazing food great vegan options amazing cocktails,5,Esti,Washington DC
Food was very good. Service was excellent.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Overall a very disappointing experience notwithstanding the fact that the people and the service were lovely. The food was too light and you need to order too many dishes to feel even remotely full. This makes for a very expensive and not satisfying enough meal.,3,bt10011,New York Area
"We really enjoyed our dinner at Nix. The lighter and bolder plates were both quite good, especially the cauliflower tempura. Chocolate mousse cake (made with avocado) was excellent!",4,Karen,New York Area
"The food is the real draw at Nix. Everything is a surprise and so tasty. On a recent evening visit for a table of 4 women we ordered 3 starter spreads (eggplant, avocado and another) with bread and veggies. Delicious. We went on to a wonderfully tasty three appetizers including burnt (on purpose!) broccoli and an egg dish and incredible asparagus dish), then finished with two desserts to share. More than enough food and everything excellent. To top it off, one of our party spilled a glass of red wine and the staff were immediately present with extra cloth napkins AND a replacement pour of the glass of wine. Most impressive service.",5,Villageperson,New York Area
"The food was all very good. But overpriced.  Had the tandoor bread with red pepper walnut dip, the French curry, the tofu skin pockets, and the chocolate mousse cake. Recommend them all, but as I said, not at these prices.  Ambience was very nice and romantic.",5,pasio,New York Area
The air wasn't working,1,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Incredibly creative and tasty food. We really enjoyed the experience as well,4,luv2dine,New York Area
"WOW. This has to be some of the very best vegetarian and vegan food I've eaten in NYC in a long time. The dishes were creative and scrumptious, and capable of woo-ing even hard-core meat eaters to the cruelty-free lifestyle. Notables were the sweet pea dumplings and a cremini mushroom entre, and the special dessert of a roasted pineapple with vegan whip cream. The whip cream was light and fluffy like a merangue, and when I asked the server how it could possibly be vegan, she said they made it from garbanzo bean juice. How creative is that?",5,HealthNut,New York Area
The food was really on point. The best meal of my trip to NYC.,5,OpenTable Diner,San Diego
"As a vegetarian, I am slightly biased as it's always a great experience going to a restaurant and being able to choose from anything on the menu. However, even my friend who is not a vegetarian thoroughly enjoyed the food. I really enjoyed all the different cuisines, as well as the encouragement to share plates. Wait staff was attentive and friendly and the overall vibes of the restaurant were welcoming and authentic  Truly in the top 3 best meals I have had at a restaurant and I would strongly recommend it to any vegetarian and even meat lovers!",5,Abbie,New York Area
"Our fifth visit to Nix and each one is better than the last. Although the front of the house is hectic and crowded, the hostess did her best to make us welcome. We were seated after a short delay towards the rear, which we prefer. The wine list is a little off-beat but we found a terrific Oregon pinot at a fair price. We started with the tandoori bread (superb) and hummus (creamy and delicious), then had the pea dumplings (one of their signature dishes) and the baby corn (tasty but a little cheesy) followed by the white asparagus risotto (wonderful) and artichoke and broccoli rabe saute (delicious but spicy). Service was prompt, friendly and knowledgeable. We spent just over $100 pp all included, which is not cheap but is definitely worth it for the quality of the food. Nix is now one of our favorite neighborhood spots and we expect to return frequently.",5,VillageDiner,New York Area
"Wonderful way for us to celebrate 3 birthdays. Staff was great , we had amazing food.  We would highly suggest this restaurant to anyone",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Unique cuisine.  When I tell friends about a ""new vegetarian restaurant"" I'd like to invite them to, they seem uninterested to try it.  But once they do, at my insistence, they are amazed and have since returned on their own.  Everything I've had to eat there is excellent.  Unusual combinations of foods, and such variety.  Bravo to the chef!!",5,Vitale,New York Area

"Lovely service, fab food.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Last minute booking, waited to be seated, then placed inappropriately at a large table in the middle of the dining room, noisy, cold unfriendly ambience. I couldn't think of a worse place to put a couple on a date!  Waited a long time for service and drinks, did not stay for food, so I cannot rate it. Won't be back. Clearly overbooked us, could have been easily avoided, very disappointing.",1,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
We really enjoyed everything we ordered. The prices are a bit high. Our server was very rude and condescending.  The management needs to do a better job at training.,4,OpenTable Diner,Las Vegas
Always a favorite since Nix opened. Dinner is consistently exceptional.,5,JF1980,New York Area
"Delicious, creative menu with surprising flavor notes and excellent wine. One note on the layout: my friend and I sat at a table in the front and experienced an off-putting echo-effect that made hearing difficult and generated an unpleasant feeling in our ears. We grew accustomed to it after 15 minutes but would recommend sitting in the back.",4,Jodie,New York Area
"The cauliflower dish topped everything. Outstanding.  Paying for the  Tandoor bread, which is available for free at many restaurants, irked me, although I got two orders.  Decibel level a little too high for me.  Servers helpful and accommodating.",3,DinerJ,New York Area

Amazing sushi and the ceviche with chips makes a great appetizer!,5,restaurantcritic1,Western NC
"We made a reservation for 6:45p Sat evening before our 8p show at Tennessee Theater. We arrived 5 minutes before our reservation and were told that we would have to wait at least 20 minutes.  We were offered a seat at the sushi bar next to the door, which we declined.  We waited at the bar and at the end of 20 minutes they still could not seat us.  Worried that we may be late for the show we took two different seats at the sushi bar.  After eating we explained to the manager that they should not take reservations on theater nights if they cannot honor them.  He apologized and was polite but offered no reasonable explanation.  We love the food but hate their high prices and bad service.  We won't go back.",1,OpenTable Diner,Dallas
"The only thing I was really disappointed about is that I made this reservation over a month ago. When we got there (right on time mind you), they said they'd had a rush of people and asked if we could sit at the bar or we could WAIT for a table- and we HAD reservations. The bar was a little cramped for my liking.",4,OpenTable Diner,E. Tennessee
Great lunch specials and quick service...awesome food.,4,OpenTableVIP,E. Tennessee

Great place for sushi and a relaxed atmosphere. Great for a date night out or out with friends. Really good food and drinks. Would definitely go back the next time we’re in Knoxville.,5,Bensterino,Western NC
"We eat here a few times each year -- mostly before attending a play or event at the Tennessee theatre next door.   The food is always delicious.   This time, we have particularly good service from a delightful waitress.    If you are going for such an event, I recommend that you go EARLIER than you think.   Our reservation was at 615pm and we barely made it to the 730pm play.   Sushi is always good.   Try the ""bowl"" if you want something large and substantial.",5,LeapingL,Atlanta
Our guests from Florida over it! They are vegan/gluten free and everyone was very accommodating to their needs. Best sushi!,5,OpenTable Diner,E. Tennessee
We go to Nama on a regular basis.  They take reservations which is great when you have tickets for something at Tennessee Theatre.  Always good.,4,Mullie,Dallas
"Good as usual if you are into fusion food. Service is good and convenient as a place to start your evening on the town. This is not traditional Japanese sushi, but tasty nonetheless. Good selection of sake. Wish that Nigori was on the happy hour deal... but alas no.",4,PrinceofGreenback,E. Tennessee

"Nama Sushi is a great little paced in Knoxville with pleasant surroundings, great and wonderful food. Service was good and the decor was also nice. Being a fan and a bit of a sushi connoisseur, Nama came highly rated and it did not disappoint. I love sushi, but neither of my girls do. They loved their meals and want to go back! I am making plans to go back and hope to very soon!",4,OpenTable Diner,E. Tennessee
Always great food. Love the miso Salmon.   We almost always choose Namas for entertaining guests or just dinner before the Theatre. It is lively and inviting,4,OpenTable Diner,E. Tennessee

Loved that I was able to make reservations. Major points for that. Good service. Great food. My friend enjoyed her birthday.,5,OpenTable Diner,Western NC
Great atmosphere and service. We were running late and were able to change our reservations easily.

"First time visit to Nama. Food was tasty and delicious, although a little pricey.",4,OpenTable Diner,Baltimore
Great sushi!,5,OpenTable Diner,New England
"Nama is a source of delicious sushi and other Japanese dishes. I would recommend it to anyone. The one downside in my opinion is the somewhat loud music inside. Other than that, it was great.",5,EequalsMCC,San Francisco
"We eat at Nama generally about once a month...usually on the way to a show at Tennessee Theater...this is our favorite place in town for sushi, but have tried several of the specialty entrees as well. The food is always fresh, high quality, and with great seasoning, and the service is always good! All this at a reasonable price point!",4,OpenTable Diner,E. Tennessee
"Delicious sushi- Impressive selections! It is one large open area, so it is on the louder side.  Our service was slow the night we went but, it was also a full house and it wasn't unbearably slow.  It's a great option.  Reliable choice.",4,Jcm606,Memphis
We had to wait 25 minutes even with a reservation. Servings are small and a bit pricey. Sushi is good.,3,Lacking,Los Angeles
Pretty decent sushi and other Asian food options.  It was a busy Friday night so service and food took a little longer but we enjoyed ourselves without feeling rushed.,4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
We have  always enjoyed Nama when we come to town.  This time around the menu seemed overdone.  They have so much stuff in there rolls now it takes away from the enjoyement of flavors.  Sometimes less is more... I will create a simpler version of my own roll next I go back.,4,JerseyNancy,Philadelphia
"We have dined at Nama on a regular basis since moving to Knoxville in 2015....we think it's the best Sushi in town, but they have many other items on the menu if not in the mood for sushi....Food is always very fresh, and the service is very good.",4,OpenTable Diner,E. Tennessee
The perfect date place!,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Went here for date night. Glad we made a reservation as it was pretty busy with a 20-30 minute wait without one.  Table was nice and lighting was low. Server had great knowledge of the sushi and made wonderful recommendations. Would definitely fine here again!,5,AdventurousPlate,Charlotte

"Reservation for twelve made and TWO e-mail confirmations from Open Table. Twelve people arrived in four cars after a drive of 30 minutes. NO cars in parking lot, but building was open and fire burning in fireplace.  No hostess, waitstaff or ANYONE! We walked the entire building calling ""is anyone here?"". No answer.  Finding tarps spread over carpet in dining room and all movable kitchen equipment sitting in the dark dining room, it was apparent that the restaurant was in a stage of remodel and the kitchen would be unable to prepare even a sandwich. Looking downstairs, the ceiling had been removed from hallway and no one present in manager's office or in adjacent grill which also appeared to be closed.  We were left with no place for dinner at almost 8:00 pm.  Driving back to town we found an accommodating restaurant and obtained excellent food and service. I am disappointed in Open Table and Overlook Restaurant.  Our last visit and positive review apparently did not warrant attention from management, as no notice of closure was sent, and even as we were cleared by security gate personnel, there was no warning from security that the place was not operating.It will be a long time before making another reservation at Overlook, and even when using Open Table for future reservations, we will confirm directly with restaurant to ensure this does not happen again. As further evidence of management neglect, during our last visit we had planned to have the Chateaubriand as shown on the web site menu, but when we attempted to order, it was no longer available and would not be offered in the future.  Current web site still shows Chateaubriand on menu. Poor management of facility and web presence.  Web site should show closure, but did not. This is not a joke, the inconvenience of twelve people and the jeopardizing of a significant birthday celebration is inexcusable.",1,JudnWifeRS,Western NC
"Really  a nice experience. After reading reviews in which others stated that improvement had occurred over the past six months, we decided to try The Overlook for an anniversary dinner.  We were not disappointed and are happy to find an upscale restaurant that is within a few miles of home. Food was imaginative and prepared in an excellent manner.  Chef has several interesting sounding features on the daily menu.  Ignore the menu on their web site, as it no longer reflects the current offerings. Open table confirmed reservation, then sent a notice of cancellation that the restaurant had cancelled our reservation. A call to the restaurant was required to resolve the problem. Phone number shown on web site and Open Table is incorrect. Service was great, our server had only our table and two others on the night we were there. We highly recommend the Overlook to anyone seeking great food and service in a quiet scenic atmosphere.  Getting to the location, which is in a Golf Course Clubhouse requires entering through a staffed security gate and driving approximately one and one half miles.  It is worth the effort and will be found to be another hidden gem!",4,JudnWifeRS,Western NC

This is  located at a private golf course so a reservation should note that they will not let you in at more then 15 minutes before the reservation. Also on Sunday they only serve between 10 am and 1 pm,5,OpenTable Diner,Charleston
We were seated promptly.  Waitress was competent and friendly.  The food was very good and creative.  Dessert was excellent.  Wine was a good value,5,JamesT,Western NC

We were very pleased about the Overlook reasturant. Will continue going there for dinner.,5,OpenTable Diner,Western NC

"The food was good and our server was attentive.  He seemed as though he was pretty new to Connestee, however he knew the specials without having to read them, and he gave us good attention.  He made one small mistake on one bill, but nothing to complain about.",4,OpenTable Diner,Western NC

"We hadn't been since we returned this spring, and the menu and quality were notably better!  We really enjoyed the second prime rib they brought out, which was delicious and rare/medium rare.  The fresh salmon was also juicy and tender. The grilled veggies were some of the best I have had - tender crisp.  It was a treat to  find the quality of food and wait staff upon our return to the area.  It is a hidden gem!  Some don't realize it is open to the public and renters in the Brevard area are missing out on a great dining experience if they miss the Overlook Clubhouse during their visit!",5,NCsummers,Savannah
Generally good food but were not aware it was a buffet dinner on Friday.,3,OpenTable Diner,Charleston
"Great food and service. Everyone was happy with the wine, the food, and the service.  Plenty of time for conversation during and after the meal. No hurry.",5,OpenTable Diner,Jacksonville
Nice menu upgrades---good service; ck dress code--most things OK,4,Pwkaplan,San Francisco
I've been coming to this restaurant for fifteen years and have had issues with one thing or another most visits.  Not now.  The new management has pretty well fixed the problems and is trying to be the best.  They are very close to making this a place that meets or exceeds expectation.  Certainly the Mother's Day Brunch price kept some away but they missed out on an exceptional meal.  The choices were wonderful and all that I could try were outstanding.  Well done David and staff.,5,SamM,Western NC
"Impeccable service, delicious food choices, and an overall wonderful dining event with awesome friends! David Miles and his staff work very hard to offer the finest culinary experiences for Connestee Falls residents and the surrounding Brevard, NC area.",5,ToniC,Western NC
A wonderful experience!  The Mother's Day brunch was excellent in variety and flavor.  The live music entertainment was a lovely extra.,5,LBG7,Western NC
"Great Mothers day brunch. Great service, huge variety of food and beautiful views of golf course and mountains.",5,OpenTable Diner,Orlando
"We live in Connestee and know the Overlook well. Our meal was great as always, we expect no less. My filet was totally outstanding and the servers were top notch. I highly recommend the Overlook and feel that it is Connestee's biggest asset.",5,OpenTable Diner,Western NC
Outstanding service and food. We went with a group of eight from a vegan to meat lovers. All of us were pleased.,4,Degan,Western NC
We had the prime rib special and it was delicious. Cooked to perfection. Beautiful view over the golf course with mountains in the background. There was also a buffet available on Friday night and a regular menu with lots of choices. Worth the drive to Connestee Falls clubhouse.,5,Helene,Richmond
We just went for Sunday brunch.  A nice day so we chose there for the physical proximity and the view.  While there was nothing wrong with any of the food there was also nothing outstanding about it.  We went because it was close and a good chance to look out over the golf course and the long range views.,4,ckla,Charlotte
"Lots to choose from.  I usually get their Eggs Benedict but this Sunday morning went for a simpler cheese omelet, saving room for their Lemon Posset - definitely try this - it is a super light but lemony pudding-like dessert.  Fantastic! We never feel rushed in the Overlook Dining Room.",5,JanfromBrevard,Western NC
"Had a very nice dinner with my wife and daughter. Another great Ruth Chris location! They are very consistent in their delivery of excellent food and top notch service.  The view was also very nice at night - the restaurant overlooks the river and the lights at night create a great atmosphere. Expensive, but no more so than other top-tier steak places.",4,OpenTable Diner,Dallas
The food was excellent and our server Brian was fantastic! We will definitely be going back when in Knoxville,5,OpenTable Diner,E. Tennessee
"We had an excellent meal prior to seeing ""Harry Potter Live"" at the Knoxville Civic Coliseum.  There were 6 of us, ranging in age from 7 to 60, and we all had wonderful food and a great birthday celebration for our grandson.  The lobster bisque was my picky teenagers favorite ever!  You have to try the seafood tower as a healthy shareable appetizer for all - presentation is spectacular, and everything was fresh and delicious.  The filet's were fabulous!  Thank you Ruth's Chris for a wonderful family experience!  We will be back!",5,stellavol,E. Tennessee
Excellent! The food was delicious! Ruth’s Chris made Celebrating my mom’s birthday perfect!,5,OpenTable Diner,E. Tennessee
"Anniversary dinner. They gave us an exceptional table and kept referencing our anniversary. They brought us a complimentary dessert, and the couple at the table next to us got engaged!-so romantic. The filet is unparalleled. We’ve been there many times; it’s always been wonderful.",5,OpenTable Diner,E. Tennessee
Our server was excellent!! The food was absolutely amazing!!! We had such a nice dinner! Thank you so much!,5,OpenTable Diner,E. Tennessee
One of our favorite evening dining establishments. The staff is always pleasant and friendly. Food is above average.,4,OpenTable Diner,E. Tennessee
It was freezing in the restaurant.  I am talking subartic temps. Food took forever to come out.  Then had to wait for a medium rare steak not well done.,4,OpenTable Diner,E. Tennessee
"Got to the location ~ 1 hr ahead of reservation, enjoyed a drink in the bar and were notified in person when our table was ready...no beepers, text, or name shouting...a nice touch",4,OpenTable Diner,E. Tennessee
"This was a New Year Eve Dinner so the restaurant was busy and that might have been the main reason for less than satisfactory service.  Our wine was good and the food arrived very quickly. When the food came out my plate broke on the server’s tray. He apologized and took the plate back to re-plate. We completely understood and was grateful the plate broke on the tray and not on the table. My food was very Ruth Chris quality, however my husband’s steak was fatty and not a good quality, but the time we noticed the waiter was gone on to other things. So after about 20 minutes we got his attention and told him about the steak. He took it back for a replacement. Another 20 minutes later we had the replacement, but I was completely finished with my dinner. So, my husband eat his steak alone. One of the managers brought the replacement with his apologies and quickly left without waiting to confirm the quality. This was OK, but would be nice for him to hang around until inspected. The steak was good so things went better.  Because there was no mashed potatoes we got another potato dish. But as said earlier the waiter wouldn’t add the up charge. So you probably would expect the way the night was going that the up charge would be in the check. Yep it was, however, I handed the waiter my card without inspecting the check. I know, never do that, but it’s Ruth Chris! I noticed the up charge before signing. So another 15 minutes while waiting for the waiter to get back before showing the up charge. He was very apologetic and went to the manager to have it fixed. This took a few minutes to get the $5 removed. It was and $200 later we left.   My biggest complaint was not the waiter, no potato, or rude hostess, it was that management couldn’t find the time to apologize and show that they cared about our experience.  Maybe they should consider making the customer more important than the bottom line.",3,Kevin,E. Tennessee
"We always enjoy the Knoxville Ruth's Chris.   We always request Darlene as our server and she is excellent.  I shouldn't mention her name, but she deserves the kudos.  Filet mignon and sides were  excellent as always.  Wonderful place to have dinner.  We would visit there more often, but we are 65 miles away.",5,Barry,Corpus Christi
Outstanding food and next level service. Our official New Years Eve destination. Ruth's Chris sets the mood for the rest of the evening. This hometown favorite is light years ahead of the other locations we have visited nationwide. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,5,JCobb007,Atlanta
"We were dining with friends that we rarely see on this trip to Ruth Chris. We had an experience that was less than the usual stellar ones from past visits.  Although the server seemed very good, one person in our party ordered the three course meal and the soup was never delivered. Also, although the restaurant did not seem overwhelmed, it took nearly an hour to get our entrees, which was way too long. The sea bass and filets were excellent but the barbecued shrimp was disappointing, swimming in a rich sauce and the spinach with it was terribly salty.  Still, this experience was an aberration and we will return.",4,Chips,New York Area
Excellent!!,5,Dave,Western NC
"Food, ambience and Service all below par.  If you're going to charge outrageous  prices for a steak &amp; al a cart items, at least make up for in outstanding service &amp; food selection.  We ordered the steak and twin lobster tails. Lobster tails were good the steak was equivalent to what we could've gotten at a Texas roadhouse !!  And they served it on a small salad plate because they were out of dinner plates.  How is a establishment of this caliber out of dinner plates  at 5:30 in the evening ??  Service was slow and unprofessional.  It wouldn't surprise me if our waiter was one of management that had to fill-in.  Knoxville has better views and property, why in the world did they choose that location to build their restaurant ,which overlooks a junky old gas yard.  Knoxvillians really need to get out of the area and see what the real world has to offer  in fine dining.  Disappointing.",3,disappointing,Nashville
We shared Christmas Eve dinner with a large group. The food and service were excellent and I very much enjoyed my cocktail. We had an issue with one of the steaks and it was corrected quickly.,5,alimaccat,E. Tennessee
"So many special occasions exist while gathering in an establishment serving food; from the reunion, first date, anniversary, celebration...you name it, the restaurant fulfills! No other occasion is as special as a holiday occasion, and Ruth’s Chris Knoxville, accommodated, confirmed, and cheerfully fed my family holiday gathering in such a special way, that the description of food choices captivated hungry minds and educated willing taste buds! Although, albeit carelessness or indifference, the reason is pointless, in serving a steamed whole lobster when what was ordered was broiled whole lobster.  The next time I have to pre-order whole lobster at Ruth's Chris Knoxville, because the kitchen has no salt water tank to keep lobsters everyday of the week, and I ask for my lobster broiled but get a steamed lobster, I will personally educate my server and chef, and between the two, they can pay for their mishap. Thank you!",4,OpenTableVIP,E. Tennessee
"Food is good  , seating  was terrible felt like we were sitting in the hall way , service good until end of meal took 45 min to get desert 😎",3,OpenTable Diner,E. Tennessee
"Great food , steak was really delicious.  Server was great  and love to have serve us next time.",5,OpenTable Diner,E. Tennessee
"We dine at Ruth's Chris once a year usually in conjunction with a downtown event.  This was a Saturday night and RC was busy.  We arrived just a few minutes before our reservation.   The 3 women at the reception desk appeared frantic with guests arriving and the phone ringing yet only 1 was actually busy.   This annoys me because RC's practice is for customers to wait in the small and uncomfortable lobby standing with your coat on where you can watch this chaos.   There is no apparent reason why you aren't seated immediately or at least greeted and advised that your table will be ready in a few minutes.   We were eventually seated at a large booth set for 4 but there were 2 of us.   Seems to me that the time we waited in the lobby could have been used to ensure that the table was ready for us--a party of 2.  Ok, enough about this annoyance with RH's seating practice.   Jason, with Chloe, served us.   Both were pleasant and attentive.   Jason is a veteran server.  RH's wine list is one of the best anywhere.  We ordered a bottle of Chateau Montelena Petite Sirah that was listed as 2010.   I was pleasantly surprised when Jason delivered that bottle.   He did say that it was the last one.   This was an outstanding value.  So often the year published on the wine list is not available but not tonight.  I was surprised that Jason didn't offer to decant this wine.   It was just fine after it was poured and got better with each pour.  My husband and I had filets that were perfectly prepared.   We each had a salad--wedge and chopped.  Our sides were Brussel sprouts and au gratin potatoes.  The potatoes were not too soft and as a result, very good.  The sprouts were a little buttery and too soft.   We will return to RC again.  Be sure to ask for a ""C-shaped"" booth overlooking the Tennessee River.   These are special and I'll be sure to request one next time.",4,Whinetodine,E. Tennessee
Had the bone in New York strip. Slightly over cooked and over seasoned I would have to say they ruined what could have been a good piece of meat. Other person in my party had 2 petite filet and shrimp as always these are good.  This restaurant's meat is a little above average.  I don't know why I keep going here. Maybe I will remember next time i'm hungry.,3,Average,E. Tennessee
"Impromptu last minute late night reservation. The employees were so warm and welcoming, accommodating and checking that everything was perfect. The appetizers, entrees, and drinks were simply wonderful. A great night.",4,OpenTableVIP,E. Tennessee
One year anniversary,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"This experience was not up to what we were expecting.  My husband and I were going out for a special date, but now I wished we had gone somewhere else.  The food was delicious, as usual, but the ambiance of this particular location is declining.  We were crammed into a tiny table that was put in with a large group gathering in the rear room.  It felt like we were at the kids table of an event we weren't even part of.  The group was so loud it was difficult for us to converse and enjoy our meal.  We would have been better off saving the money and going to a another local restaurant or going to a Ruth's Chris else where.  I was so let down by this experience that we will not be going back to this location.  It ruined the dinner portion of this special date for us.",2,OpenTable Diner,Nashville
This was my first visit to a Ruth's Chris. My wifeboth of us being military this was a very special treat for us and we weren't disappointed. An amazing experience.,5,OpenTable Diner,E. Tennessee

Service was great and the amount of staff was excellent for our Birthday event.,4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
We love Ruth,5,OpenTable Diner,Nashville
My husband ordered the traditional thanksgiving feast and was very satisfied with everything. I ordered some of the best lamb chops I've had in a long time.,5,two4dinner,Nashville
"I asked for a table next to the window through Open Table and that is exactly where we were seated.  Service was excellent and steaks were very tasty, cooked perfectly and HOT.  Asked for a bottle of wine on the list, they were out but recommended a more expensive wine, similar at the same price as my selection.  The wine was excellent.",5,OpenTable Diner,Cincinnati
Outstanding service and food. Just delicious and a great experience as always.,5,MJP2,New Orleans
"Steak over cooked, wrong salad, wrong side, didn't bring bread",2,OpenTable Diner,Western NC
"Overall good.  Waiter was a bit snippy at the outset but things smoothed over time. Food was typically good Ruth’s fare.  A local celeb,  Johnny Majors, sat next to us.   We did note that certain parts of the place could use an overall; eg the material on our booth was frayed beyond normal wear and tear.",4,Chimichurri,New York Area
I'm just a Louisiana girl who loves Ruth's Chris - the Knoxville location lived up to Ruth's standards! Great bar to escape the rain and still watch the game! Knoxville and UT fans are awesome - we had a great time - thanks for the hospitality!,5,OpenTable Diner,New Orleans
Good evening and glad we were able to dine again at Ruth's Chris. Ken was helpful and accommodating with reservation and changes. Appreciated.,5,OpenTable Diner,Nashville
"The food at Ruth's Chris is reliably excellent. I love their selection, but would occasionally like to see more fish on the menu.",5,JakeL,Charleston
"Our reservations were at 4:30, right when RC opened and they did not have one of the featured seasonal menu items, which was a disappointment. Our server told us they had run out; however, if they were already ""out"" at opening time, that tells me that the restaurant didn't have the item to begin with.",4,KS853,Orlando
It was such a nice place - parking was easy and the food and ambiance was perfect.  Thank you.,5,FatDag,New Orleans

Steaks wonderful as usual.  Amazing Caesar salad!!  Server was a little overloaded due to shortage of  one server calling in sick...our soup order wasn't entered into the system.   Corkage fee is very reasonable!! Would be nice to have valet service more than just on weekends. Amazing how CASUAL most people dressed at such a fine restaurant!!,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"two quiches, one shrimp and grits, one waffle sandwich: All just outstanding  Bloody Mary was excellent too",5,BigBoy,Charleston
This is an excellent choice for a Sunday brunch.   We had tried the Eggs Benedict the previous Sunday and found that dish to be outstanding.  This week I had the cheesy grits with blackened shrimp and fried egg - the best I've ever had.   My wife had the Connestee Quiche  - delicious and very generous portion - couldn't finish the outstanding home fries.  We'll be back next Sunday to try other items on this new menu.,5,OpenTable Diner,Western NC
This restaurant is under new management with a new chef and the improvement is remarkable.,5,OpenTable Diner,Birmingham
Pleasantly surprised. We had not eaten at this venue for a few months.  Dramatic improvement in food and service.,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
The home  fries that were served to me were almost burned and cold. My husband's were fresh out of the fryer and delicious. I pointed this out to our server and she apologized and got me another plate. The first ones should have never come  out of the kitchen.,3,julie,New England

"We were visiting the community to do some house hunting and wanted to have dinner in the dining room to get a sense of what we could expect when we live in Connestee Falls. The new menu offered several choices that were very appealing to us. The service was excellent and our Bananas Foster prepared table side by the food and beverage manager, David was wonderful.",5,OpenTable Diner,Tampa
Better reservation coordination with the club. Heart healthy food offerings.,3,sunshine,Western NC
"The Overlook is much improved since the change in management team in 2016.  Menu items cater to all tastes and pocketbooks.  The wine selection is top-notch, although there could be a few more at $20-$25.  New servers are on the ball and ready to please.  I'd like the servers to emulate Europe a bit more and bring the bread/rolls immediately.  The liqueur trolley is a nice new touch.",5,Tuscanwino,Western NC
We had a lovely Thanksgiving dinner. Our waitress and staff was excellent...couldn't have asked for more accommodating service with a smile. The food selections were abundant and very nice. We are so fortunate to have this amenity available to us in this beautiful community. It is a pleasure to be able to share with family and friends. Thank you.,5,OpenTable Diner,Western NC
"We are seasonal residents of the community where Overlook is located.  It is a great convenience to have a restaurant nearby; however, the quality has had it's ups and downs over the years.  This time, we were very pleased with our meals.  We had the prime rib, which was delicious as were the accompanying roasted potatoes and fresh seasonal vegetables.  The service was congenial and prompt.",4,ECF2,Miami

"We LOVE Brunch and we LOVE Brunch at the Overlook in Connestee Falls. The menu is terrific - hard to choose what to have.  This is our second Sunday in a row, so we could try more choices.  Everything was great!  So far we have tried: Ham, Swiss &amp; Berry Jam waffle sandwich - unbelievably good! Ultimate Breakfast Sandwich - also amazing.  Thought it was too big to eat it all but my husband did! Connestee English Breakfast, with eggs, sausage, bacon, tomato, sauteed mushrooms, baked beans, home fries and fried bread - whew!  Reminds me of my trips to England. And of course the Classic Benedict - perfect poached eggs, perfect hollandaise. Had the Bellini both times - so good!",5,JanfromBrevard,Western NC
Both we and our friends enjoyed both the food and the quiet atmosphere. Server was super courteous and great in every way. We had the prime rib which is reliably great. Drinks were super which I expect from John the master bartender and now manager.,5,OpenTable Diner,Western NC

I had the roast duck which was not greasy at all, crisp and flavorful. We'll definitely go back.",5,OpenTable Diner,Western NC
Outstanding menu featuring expertly prepared entrees and specials.  The presentation was top notch and the food was excellent.  The Overlook is featuring a new wine list with a number of great selections.  The service was great.

"Our Connestee House is our vacation home and whenever we are there we try to eat at the Clubhouse as much as possible, we enjoy the scenery, the food, the service  and the convenience. A couple of years ago we had a family gathering of 20 some people for a birthday and it was a total success.  If it would be possible personally I would like if at least 1 French and 1 Italian wine were offered as a choice.",5,Christina,Miami
WOW the Tuna special we had was superb. So Fresh and cooked perfect. The wasabi slaw and seaweed salad was a wonderful complement. Don't forget to check out the new wine list - some fabulous choices.   The service was outstanding with willingness to meet and exceed expectations. There are not may places to sit and enjoy your meal with friends while being entertained by the every changing mountain and golf course views.,5,LyndaH,Western NC
Food and presentation very good. Excellent wine list. Wait staff very polite,5,Dorsey,Western NC
"Further evaluation. staff is working on improvements. food was good, service staff good.",4,OpenTable Diner,Western NC
"We've been fans of the Clubhouse all along. Only a few minutes away and the best restaurant in the whole town. Overall the food is great and the menu changes and there's always something for me to enjoy. My wife is pushing for a couple of more veggie items but she still  finds something as is. The manager, David Miles is a great guy, the servers are great, and what else can I say, this place is Connestee's best asset in my opinion. And oh, yes Opentable is a great idea. We'd have lost my birthday reservation if it weren't for Opentable.",5,OpenTable Diner,Western NC
"This was our first time visiting here. The dining room overlooks a beautiful golf course. There were 10-15 deer grazing on the course, with golfers playing nearby. This restaurant serves meals like we like, with salad/soup course, bread, entree with starch and vegetables. I had the rack of lamb which was delicious and my wife had prime rib which she enjoyed. The server recommended a nice wine. For dessert we split a large slice of the most delicious cake we have ever had. It was an excellent experience. We are new homeowners in Connestee Falls and consider this a wonderful resource. It is open to the public as well and is a scenic drive from Brevard (about 8 miles). Highly recommend!",5,OpenTable Diner,Little Rock
This is a gem in the south east side of Transylvania County 6 miles from downtown Brevard and 3 miles from Dupont State Forest.  The casual atmosphere has a mountain elegance as you dine with the view of the mountains in the distance.  The food is superb and the service is outstanding. Entering to a lovely sitting area with a fireplace and open deck to enjoy the evening sites is only surpassed by the warm and friendly welcome.,5,LyndaH,Western NC
"It was our first time trying this place. I had the Heritage Pork Shank with Brussels Sprout and my Wife had the Lemon Roasted Chicken Breast, both were very good! Recommend both as a must try! Had the Fried blueberry pie and the Beignets for dessert. The Beignets were light, fluffy and sugar rolled. The fried pie was good with a delicious blueberry filling.  As a side note I would recommend the Beignets with the blueberry filling as a dipping option.",5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Food was good,5,Mahal,Charlotte
Our meal was somewhat average. We were however taken back by the charge of the Bourbon that my husband ordered. It was extremely high compared with comparable restaurants in the Charlotte area. The biscuits that were brought to our table were cold. My husband ordered the grilled meatloaf and he said it was dry. I ordered the shrimp and grits and they were very yummy! Not sure we would choose to return given the number of restaurants in the area to choose from.,4,Nana,New England
"Everything was great. Food, service and ambiance is always the way it should be.",5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
It was restaurant week so you had a few choices to pick from . My husband really liked the shrimp and grits. My fish was good but a bit greasy. The asian roll Appetizer was good and so was the banana Dessert  Ithe service was great,4,OpenTable Diner,Western NC

"New South never disappoints!  We were seated promptly and our server was super attentative the whole evening.  Two of us did the restaurant week menu and the other two in the party ordered off the regular menu.  All the meals were delicious, start to finish.",5,HoosierFoodie,Charlotte
"Great southern comfort food, everything our group had was very good.  It's a little loud so if you're looking for a quiet evening this might not be the spot, but overall we really liked it!",4,JamesM,San Francisco

"New South Kitchen has become our favorite ""go to"" restaurant. The prices are reasonable for the quality of food. Love the innovative twist on many of the traditional Southern dishes! My beau loves the meatloaf; I'm partial to the butternut squash salad! And the biscuits! Yum!!",5,eattolive,Charlotte
Service was great. Shrimp and grits-the sauce was tasteless  the grits were in a clump  Would take the dish off the menu,4,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
I searched Open Table for last minute reservations the day before Christmas Eve and New South Kitchen and Bar had a vacancy during our desired time. Boy did we luck up!  The food was absolutely outstanding!  Everyone in our party chose a different meal and we all loved every bite. My favorite was the collard greens. They were cooked the perfect southern way!  The restaurant is in the Arboretum Shopping Center and I never knew it was there. We will definitely be back. The drive from Rock Hill is worth it. You have to check it out!,5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"I've been patron a  of  NSK for a long time because mainly  it's a farm to fork .  The food has consistently been good, using local farmers, which I'm a strong proponent.   After my last visit, I've decided I'm not returning because your restaurant is very dirty, outdated and in dire need of an upgrade!  The bathrooms are gross and there's always one toilet out of order.  The hallway going to the bathrooms is unsightly and dirty as well.  It's a storage area which customers should not be subject to.   The carpet is filthy and needs replacing. The booths  and decor need updated as well.  The newer section with the bar is still nice, but again the older original section needs some serious attention.  One last issue, several times I have been in after 5:00 pm and the special of the night is still not available for the server to announce to the table.  This latest visit  was the worse delay I had experienced.   By 5:30, the server was still unable to give us the special of the night.  The explanation on  both of the these occasions were - the chef is still working on it!  By that time the special should be available to the customer!  Something is awry there - prep - organization - communication ???  Oh, by the way, the server never did offer us the special!  I hope these issues will seriously be heard because NSK is a long time establishment and it  would be disheartening to see these chronic issues be the demise of the future.",3,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"The food was good. The server was pleasant, but did not provide any opinion on the dishes we asked her about. The beer selection was good.",4,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"Everything that we've ordered was very good, from appetizers to desert.  Even the Manhattan cocktail was one of the best I've had.",5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
A hidden farm- to- table gem. Tonight had bone marrow appetizer for the first time. It was excellent. The salmon entree was off the chart delicious  My family always enjoys the New South Kitchen!,5,Parmgirl,Charlotte
"The food is generally quite good and well priced. Our service was not what we expected though. The waiter appeared annoyed that he had to wait on us, asked me to hand him dishes when I was trying to eat and had to be asked 3 times to bring butter to our table. The butter finally  arrived after we had finished everything but the mashed potatoes that required the butter. We have always had excellent service in the past so we were quite surprised by this experience.",3,btaylor,Charlotte
Reunion- all was great!,5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"We consistently enjoy New South.  We love that they have local grass-fed beef in their burgers, we really love their deviled eggs appetizer, and the restaurant is just very comfortable (from lighting to noise level to seats). We like their good comfort foods (like shrimp and grits or pimento cheese burgers or collard greens) &amp; appreciate their GF menu (which you need to ask for). One of our favorite local restaurants in South Charlotte.",5,sustainableeater,Charlotte
Normally my experience with New South is phenomenal so my expectations  for a Monday night were high and I had suggested the restaurant . Food and service not as  great as it normally is.,3,Liz1,Charlotte
"The food was amazing.  Fried green tomatoes appetizer for my daughter-in-law, who never had them.  3 of us had seafood --- really good.  My son had a cheeseburger and said it was the best he had ever had.  (And he really should know.)",5,DavidR,Charlotte
"I'm conflicted; some elements were great while others disappointing. I booked for Thanksgiving evening more than a month in advance. The day before the reservation, I noticed that the stated closing time was right after our reservation so we showed up early, concerned they would stop supplying the buffet mid-meal. When we arrived, they advised they could not set us for 30+ minutes, even though I saw several empty tables, so we decided to eat at the bar, even though that meant getting hit with chilly air every time someone opened the door. The buffet meats were good, sides excellent, soups just okay, and salad would have been find except the unlabeled dressing ended up being some kind of orange vinaigrette which had an off-putting taste that did not go well with the other ingredients. About halfway through our meal, they cleared away the salad bar entirely--ok since neither of us liked it. A bit later, we saw employees unloading the main buffet food into take-home boxes, presumably for themselves. That's totally fine, and I hope they enjoyed, though it did re-emphasize the fact that we were wise to show up early and forego a real table because if we had waited until our actual reservation, we would have been out of luck. The real disappointment was at the end. All the employees were very friendly, which we found to be a delight. However, after I had rendered my credit card for payment, the server brought it back advising that gratuity had already been added. Almost all tipping etiquette guides recommend that tipping for buffet, when the server really just brings drinks, should be around 5 to 10%, though I always leave more, and would have been happy to leave more on Thanksgiving. However, for our party of 2, we were assessed a mandatory tip of 20% without asking us in advance. That was mentioned nowhere on the website (I checked several times), nowhere on OpenTable, nowhere in the confirmation call, and nowhere in person until after we had been charged.  Bad ending.",3,CharlotteFoodie,Charlotte
"New South Kitchen has become a Thanksgiving ritual. In fact, I've recommended it to others and they have loved it to.  When I come back during the year, it still doesn't disappoint.",5,KarynB,Charlotte
I went for Thanksgiving. I thought Cracker Barrel was better and for a lot less money. It was nice not to cook but it was $50 a person and the food was not on par for the price. I also thought the food wasn't very hot. I do not know about the regular menu. I only had the Thanksgiving buffet.,3,ThanksgivingDiner,San Francisco
... as always we look for a place to celebrate Thanksgiving.  We were not disappointed.  We left content and happy... worth the drive for us..,4,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"This is our third year having Thanksgiving at New South. As always,  we love the soup, sides and the world's best bread pudding.  Roast beef was grand! We're less crazy about the fried turkey breast (low on flavor) or the pulled pork,  which was less pulled than expected. Still, a great place for Thanksgiving!",5,Annimal,Charlotte
"Great food, Outstanding service, and a varied menu!",4,OpenTable Diner,Orange County
We had a wonderful Thanksgiving at the New South Kitchen &amp; Bar.  We were seated right away. Food was delicious.  Our server was very nice and attentive. Well organized Thanksgiving spread which made for an enjoyable afternoon!,5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
Excellent as always. Great fresh creative dishes. A local gem!,5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
We frequently eat at New South and this trip was just as good as always. Wonderful specials and burgers hit the spot.,5,CarolinaSoprano,Charleston
"Very creative brunch menu at very reasonable prices,",5,RobertM,Charleston
One of my favorites.  Always great food.  Inventive menu.  Will be back again and again.,4,Joey,Charlotte
"First of all my server, Kelsey, was excellent.  Very knowledgeable about the menu including items not listed on the menu.  She recommended a new appetizer, Andouille Hush Puppies that were amazing.  I had Grilled Meatloaf and Mashed Potatoes.  The meatloaf was exceptional with a demi glace that was superb.   Additionally I had a handcrafted cocktail, a Bourbon Honey Cocktail that was also excellent (I consider myself a bourbon connoisseur).    If you are in Charlotte, in the Matthews area, I HIGHLY recommend paying New South Kitchen &amp; Bar a visit!",5,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
the atmosphere was very good. We enjoyed our waitress very much. The food was very good and cooked to perfection.,4,JamesM,"Dined on February 3, 2018"
"Server wasn’t good. In addition to having to come back twice to get our order right, she couldn’t answer questions we had about the menu and didn’t offer to find out. We came to celebrate our 49th anniversary and our friends birthday and she barely acknowledged us.  Most of the food was good, but I added Oscar to my steak and it was cold.",4,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"Great food with great service, as always.  You will never be disappointed going here",5,Mtpleasantpair,"Dined on February 2, 2018"
My girlfriend and I decided to eat here for our restaurant week choice. Upon check in the lady at the check in was rude stating that she tried to call and confirm our reservation approx 15 mins upon arrival. Not knowing the number I chose to not answer. I originally was having trouble booking online and decided to call. To get to the point we were double booked for the same time. Clearly not our fault. We got to our table and it took a long time to be approached understandably so due to restaurant week. We chose to upgrade from the 35 dollar selection to the 45 dollar selection. We wanted scallops and happy to pay the difference. When the meal arrived to us the scallops on both plates looked amazing until we tasted them. They clearly were not rinsed and had sand on them. Nothing like the grit of sand when you bite down. Hard to continue on. We approached the waiter and he quickly apologized and offered to get us something else. Dinner was basically ruined at this point. At no point did we get angry. The manager/owner unsure came and asked us about the situation. He apologized as well. We went on to the dessert and made our selections. The waiter came back and stated that they were out of everything but their chocolate cake. Convenient that there was an up charge for this amazing giant piece of triple chocolate cake. He suggested that we split one piece and take the other one home. I must tell you this was a single child size portion of cake. The to go box of the second piece even said small chocolate cake on it. Clearly they were running out of food... Our meal with tip came to $150. Not one adjustment for the terrible meal. We didn’t ask for that but it’s just good business. I will never be back.,1,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
Our service was excellent as the restaurant was full. We had a fabulous waiter and a really good table runner. The tables around the perimeter are a little too close together.,5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"Excellent restaurant, I would highly recommend eating here. Great drinks, great food and reasonably priced!",5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
Excellent food and ambience  Great live music and service,5,Priya,Charlotte
"First time dining and was impressed with the decor and the food.  We went when it was Queen Feast and got a nice deal on a three course meal.  We opted for the upcharge to get the nicer cuisine and was pleased. The server was pleasant and well informed but seemed stretched between his tables.  We waited a long time for our cocktails and wine with dinner came after we started to eat b/c we were tired of waiting. Overall, we had a nice dinner.  I enjoyed my rack of Lamb very much.",4,OpenTable Diner,New England
"The bread they serve isn't fresh baked and served cold. Multiple sinned in tge menu were not in stock. Yet the server was very friendly and accommodating. It was pretty noisy upon arrival because there was a live performance and dancing at the bar. But it was a lot less noticeable where we were seated. The lighting was great, dim enough to create an intimate setting, but bright enough to see your food easily. The entre' was good, but the carrot cake was excellent.",3,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
Great service and food! I definitely recommend this restaurant!,5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"Went for restaurant week with a friend and had the best steak!!  The mashed potatoes were sooo good too!  The only disappointment was the mojito...it was way too strong.  They even diluted it, but didn’t help 😕",5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
The food was amazing and the atmosphere was even better. The steaks were cooked to perfection and the Charleston crab soup was some of the best I’ve had. Will definitely make another trip.,5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"Went to M&amp;M during restaurant week; sat in the dining room to the left of bar where it was much quieter than the main dining room to the right.  Our poor waiter was the ONLY ONE for NINE tables.  The ONLY help he got was when someone brought food out from the kitchen.  Our glasses were empty most of the night and when we asked for something it took a while to get it.  He was doing the best he could so I don't fault the waiter at all, he was very nice and accommodating; I fault the management.  Another management issues was we arrived and were about to be seated in the middle of the dining room when there were three tables open by the floor to ceiling windows.   I asked if we could move to a table by the window, where it'd be much more private and was told the tables were ""assigned""...Huh?  They said those people had a reservation; I'm like I have a reservation as well and I'm here and they aren't!  After the hostess would not move us, I went to the manager who first said no and when I looked at her like you should really take care of the customer in front of you, not the one who hasn't arrived, she reluctantly moved us. Not my best dining experience and I'll have to think twice before I go back.",1,CTSC,Charlotte
"Just okay, overpriced and food was not good. Our server had over nine tables so we were there for three hours. Bread was cold, the pasta was over sauced and my lobster tails were tough.",3,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
Excellent she crab soup and scallops with browned butter.  Steaks looked good too!  Yummy dessert options.  Great for a girls gathering.,5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
Great food and service.  The live music in the bar area was way above normal.  The guys were fantastic!!!!,5,FANTASTIC,Charlotte

Great first time meal here during restaurant week. Will definitely be back!,4,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
The food was wonderful. Portions were well beyond our expectations and the service was very cordial. We both took boxes home with food for the next day!,5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
The food was good but a lot of butter. They had also ran out of some of the sides but overall decent price and great tasting food.,3,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte

"My wife and I, plus another couple, came to eat at Mickey &amp; Mooch for Queen's Feast on 01/21/2018. We arrived earlier than our reservation, but it was no problem. We were seated by the staff. A short time later, our waiter Victor started taking our order. The food in this place is excellent. I have been here before, and as far as the food and service is concerned, top notch-was very satisfied.  However, the tables in the area I was seated was very close together.  There was very little room to get in or out of the seats.  Even some of the waiters found it difficult to get to a table they were serving. But in spite of that, I had a good time.",4,HenryG,Charlotte
Food was good but the cleanliness of the restaurant is not. The tables had burnt holes and food stains on the cover clothes.. it needs a deep clean and little touch up,3,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"The hostess was very dismissive. She passed us by twice before even acknowledging our presence, even though we were standing right at the hostess' podium. The bar scene is energetic; so if you want to dance, this is the place for you. The food was dismal. The shrimp in the shrimp cocktail was old. It definitely wasn't fresh shrimp. It probably came from the local  grocer's freezer section. The cocktail sauce was frozen. The mashed potatoes were bland. A little salt can go a long way (cooking tip). The ribs... minuscule and charred sum up that entree selection. Our server was very nice and diligent. That was the best part of our experience.",2,restaurantweekdiner,Charlotte
"This was my first time at the South Charlotte location. I recommended this restaurant to my group of friends because the food is really good. We had a 9:00pm Reservation. We were informed that the kitchen was running behind upon our arrival. We were sat around 9:30. After receiving the news that they were completely out of the crab soup (which was the dish that I was looking the most forward to), we did not receive our appetizers until around 10:40. We had to ask for bread, no one automatically brought it out for us. Our water glasses were filthy. We all had little swimmers in the bottom of our glasses. Once the food came out, it was good. The atmosphere as well as the service at the Huntersville location seems to be more pleasant. I will probably never visit the South Charlotte location again.",2,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
Love this place! Always a great meal. Chef Mickey and staff do a great job and food is delicious.,5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"We were at M&amp;M during restaurant week, so service isn't ever perfection during this busy time at any restaurant; however, the service was particularly sub-par this evening. It took forever for our first course to arrive, then our entrees arrived before anyone was even close to being finished with salads/soups. The table just wasn't big enough to hold all the plates. The staff delivering our plates didn't offer any solutions. She just handed us our entrees and left. I literally held my plate with one hand, off the table, while eating a couple more bites of my salad and was able to hand that plate to another server walking by. Desserts were slow to come, as well. Our server was pleasant and was working hard. The restaurant clearly was understaffed. We all enjoyed our food and will go back again when it's not restaurant week.",4,CBrinkley,Charlotte
"This has been my favorite restaurant for over 10 years.  I love the quantity, value, quality, and variety of the menu items.",5,IloveOpenTable,Charlotte
"Food was Excellent, Service was lousy. It took forever to get our order taken, then same for our order to be delivered. The waitress was inattentive. Her name is Brandy. They suggest 2 hours for your meal there. I now know why. We arrived at approx. 5:30. No alcohol, Nearly 8pm before we were out.",4,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
Food was awesome... as usual!!,5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte

Bench seating was atrocious. It had very little support and positioned you very low at the table. We waited an excessive time for our waitress and she seemed to be too busy to attend to our table. We had to ask for initial drinks and main order. There were no suggestions made about the menu. We had to ask.  M&amp;M has come down a long way. I doubt we return. I was embarrassed for our guests.,1,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte

"I brought a special friend here to celebrate her birthday.  The  great service and the food both added to the occasion.  Even though we had not ordered dessert, the waitress, knowing why we were there, surprised us with a cake and candle to help us finish off the celebration.  It was a really  nice thoughtful touch to a really nice evening.",5,SusanSl,Atlanta
Great food and great fast service. Felt very professional.,5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"I have always enjoyed Ilios Noche at Quail Corners, but I thought on Saturday they were having an off night.  I don't know if they were not prepared for the number of guests or what the issue was, but the food wasn't as good as usual and the service was slower than usual too.   It was also noisier, but we were sitting close to the bar and may request sitting further away on my next visit.  Overall, it was a disappointing experience.",2,ret923,Charlotte
"I was surprised that the service was poor, and tomatoes in the Greek Country salad were mealy and flavorless.  We never seemed to be able to locate our server for another drink or silverware for that matter while our food sat in front of us getting cold.    I am hoping this was a one off scenario as I have been here many times and been and visited the original off of Providence even more. Typically, the food is fantastic and the service excellent.",3,CLTFOODYWINE,Las Vegas
They were very accommodating with our reservation. We ended up being very late. The bar staff was outstanding. Very attentive.  Grilled octopus was very good.  Will definitely return.,4,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"We made our reservations for 7:45 and were finally sat at 8:10. It was restaurant week so they had to bring in extra outdoor furniture for people to sit at so it was a little uncomfortable and cramped. We usually love Ilios Noche’s vibe and ambience but we weren’t very pleased with it this visit. The food, however, was still delicious.",4,Julie,Charlotte
Everything was delicious!  The fried zucchini chips were wonderful!  The Ilios salad was fresh and I had scallops also. We all decided we had to return soon!,5,Shellbell,London
Excellent service. Food is always very fresh and delicious.,5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
We completely enjoyed our evening. The food was wonderful and the service was outstanding.

"As always is the case, the service, the food and the value of the meal were all exceptional. We are never disappointed.",5,John,Charleston
"We were an early reservation on Saturday of Restaurant Week.  The restaurant was only lightly occupied when we arrived at 5:40 for our 5:45 reservation.  Still we had to wait to be seated.  The Queen's Feast menu was impressive and we were reading it when our server asked if we wished anything from the bar.  My spouse likes gimlets made with Rose's lime.  But, the server had difficulty understanding my request.  Then came back and Ilios Noche does not have Rose's.  So, we had beer.  The calimari was the best part of the meal!  My partner's chicken souvlaki was pretty ordinary.  Seemed to have good flavor, but cooked dry. My Greek ribs were definately cooked dry.  The desserts were a pecan square with ice cream  and flourless chocolate cake.    Even with the Queen's Feast deal presented to us, it seemed expensive for what it was--an okay meal, but nothing special.",3,JGwynn,Charlotte
"Love this restaurant, but we had a reservation for 7:30 and when we came in at 7:25 we heard the hostess tell someone the wait was 30 minutes.  She then acknowledge us and found our reservation.  She said it would be a few minutes, but we waited over 25 minutes to be seated and only after we inquired and complained that others were being seated.",4,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"Have been here many times. Unfortunately this time was disappointing. The bread and dessert were stale even after three replacements. Three entres were good but three scallop dinners were skimpy and very mediocre.   Having been there many times, we will give them another chance.  We have never been disappinted before this trip",3,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"Ilios Noche had excellent food! One member of our group participated in the restaurant week specials and was really pleased with the quality and amount of food offered with this menu.  The  mixed hummus appetizer was yummy, and the chicken piccata and chicken Parmesan was also a big hit! The smoked cocktail, draft beer, and Moscow mule were tasty libations.  The atmosphere was pleasant, the live music a nice accompaniment, and the overall service attentive.  It was a great experience!",5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
Dinner was beautiful AND FABULOUS!  We love this place - it is always great and the service is fun and cheerful.  The food is superb!!,5,Dixonjar,Charlotte
We enjoyed the dinner very much. A real find thanks to restaurant week. We will definitely be back!,4,DonaldT,Orlando
"Our server, Nadia, was awesome!! So attentive and right there when we needed her. And the food is worth raving about - Ilios Noches on Park Rd is absolutely my favorite local dining spot!",5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"This restaurant is super cool inside. The server atmosphere seemed to be a little jumbled. The food was ok - not loaded with flavor. The appetizers were good. I told the server I was allergic to spice and he recommended an appetizer that wasn’t spicy. I had people at the table taste it before I did, as always, and all of them said it had quite a kick. We will probably not be going back. It wasn’t bad but there are too many other restaurants to try - and others we love - to go back to one that was mediocre.",3,Lauren727,Charlotte

The food reminded me of a watered down Mediterranean cuisine. Overall it is satisfactory mainly because of the ambience,5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
The marinated lamb chops and greek fries are amazing,5,Mcriddick31,Charlotte
"The food and service were great!! However, it seemed like there was no point in us making a reservation because we ended up waiting for 50 minutes! We would have left had it not been a birthday dinner. And the hostesses looked very clueless. They gave us a wrong waiting time twice!  We would probably come back, because the service and food are great, however, not during holiday days.",3,TRsc,Charlotte
"I’m thinking this was just an off night as we have had some really good meals there.  Two of us ordered Chicken Piccata and one had a huge breast of chicken and the other an extremely smaller portion.  No broccolini as stated on menu, but they did bring it out when requested.  It was just bland, but again, I am hoping this is a one time thing.   Excellent service as always.",4,CLTDiner,Western NC
Our server Marco was amazing. He was extremely attentive and helpful when deciding on drinks and food. Loved his sense of humor also!  The food was delicious.,5,FoodieBabs1950,Charlotte
"Our waitress work hard for us to get the perfect glass of wine.  Food presentation, taste and temperature were 5 star.",5,AlfredP,Charlotte
"Everything was delicious except for the big disappointment of the one item we dined here, for - the grilled octopus. It was VERY  burned and some pieces were completely wasted as we couldn't eat them at all  because it was totally charred 360°and through to the middle. The pieces we could eat were extremely bitter because of one side of each piece being burned beyond recognition.  We should have returned both orders; yes we payed $28 for those two orders; we were taking another couple out to eat and they didn't want to make a fuss because we were treating them, so they kept insisting that they would just eat it. We should have returned it.  We've never had a problem here  before with the grilled octopus, it's always been perfect and honestly,  it's the only reason we took this couple there.  The chef never should've let it go to the table. If he messed up, leave it to the staff if they feel like eating it;  he should've prepared us proper dishes.",4,DinaK,Charlotte
One of our favorite restaurants.  Love the lamb soulvaki and awesome cosmos!,5,TheChairman,Charlotte
"great food and service, our server was very attentive to all our picky needs.",5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"Our server was very attentive but interrupted way too much.  Every time he came to the table, to give us forks or take away plates, he interrupted our conversatiion.  It felt like the meal was about him and keeping things moving rather than our enjoyment.  The food is great.  Among the four of us we had ribs, salmon, spinach pie, lamb burger and a Greek salad.  All wonderful.",4,CltMM,Charlotte

"We haven't been to Mickey and Mooch in a long time and were somewhat disappointed with the food and the atmosphere.  The Caesar salad dressing was bland to say the least.  I sent it back.  This is something I rarely do.  The fish was okay.  It was heavily breaded.  The tables were jammed together so you could easily hear others conversations.  Several years back under different ownership, it was a delicious and fun experience.",3,Disappointed,Charlotte
"Our server went above and beyond, especially with our small grandson's needs.  She was pleasant and fun!  Sorry I don't remember her name.",5,Easterngirl,Charlotte
The food was awesome and the portion size is amazingly large.,5,Chrissy,Atlanta
"Great meal,fast service,and a vibrant bar scene with live entertainment.Met the owner Mickey very involved and takes pride in his food. will definately come back and bring friends.",5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"Dined with group of women business professionals. Service was indifferent. Drinks did not arrive until a very few minutes before our dinners. Those who delivered the meals had no clue as to who had ordered what. Two in the group received their meals about 8 minutes before the rest of the group. While I might recommend the restaurant for the food, I would caveat the recommendation with a warning about slow and spotty service.",2,Disappointed,Charlotte
"This used to be a very good restaurant. Now the staff seems lackadaisical, the food was just OK. It is always a bad sign when the menus are grubby, no excuse for that. Way better places to go and spend you hard earned money.",1,ChrisP,Charlotte
The entrees and salads are outstanding.  High flavor without over the top spices. The filet is perfectly prepared!  The desserts are mouthwatering and deserve more attention that you can give them after a big meal.  Take some home  for coffee later or next day. Wait staff has always been attentive and pleasant.  The bread could be served warmer. Still my favorite place.,5,capo2,Charlotte
"This was our first time at Mickey and Mooch and it was the last day of restaurant week. I was expecting it to be similar to Ruth Chris or Del Frisco's, but it was much more of a low budget steakhouse. This would have been okay, except for the following: 1) my steak was gray. It did not have a seared crust, it was just an unappealing gray. The doneness was correct (med rare), but how they got there wasn't right 2) my husband got the red snapper and it was tasteless. He only ate about a quarter of it. 3) the creme brûlée was weird. We couldn't quite identify what was wrong, but it wasn't very good 4) the tablecloths were plastic and dirty.  On the upside the crab soup was very good. We won't be going back there, except maybe to the bar.",3,NewToCharlotte,Denver
"This is our regular neighborhood spot. Mickey's food is always wonderful. Great live entertainment, dancing and cocktails!",5,lorna73,Charlotte
"This is the second time we have ate here in a week.  The first time was the beginning of restaurant week in the Queen city.  So we ordered off the $45 menu.  I got steak, the wife got sea bass.  Everything delicous.  During the week, some friends of ours decided they wanted M&amp;M's so we told them we will go back.  So we go back and stated that we were going to have the very same items as last week.  Having a little more time at the table this week,  we were wondering what would our meal be if it wasn't restaurant week?  Well, we found out.  It would be around $16 cheaper!",4,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"I was out to celebrate an upcoming wedding with friends during restaurant week. Our appetizers and our main courses were really good. We had a very friendly waiter. Service was slow, and the restaurant was not full at the time. This is one of my favorite places to go, so we will go again.",4,QueensFeast,Charlotte
Food this good in a strip mall?  What a pleasant surprise. Good ambience and terrific service topped off a fantastic evening.,5,OpenTable Diner,Indiana
Everything was perfect for wedding anniversary dinner!  Great evening. Thank you Pump House.,5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
See my review from September 2017. Consistently good food &amp; service.,5,OpenTable Diner,Charleston
"Enjoyed the river view as we dined on the heated Porch. The service was very good and the food was tasty. We especially enjoyed the muffins, pork chop and bacon brussels - yum!",4,CeeCee,Charlotte
I'd been several times but not with my husband.  Finally got him to take me for my birthday lunch.  So peaceful and great river view.  We dined on the heated patio.  I think he'll go back!,5,Ablkee,Dined 4 days ago
"The Pump House is a great place to take a customer.   The latest experience was early in the week and the dining room was not busy/loud.  The ambience is always great, but when the restaurant is full, the noise level can become and issue.  Overall, still a great place.",5,ARIC,Charlotte
Great first time experience!!!! We were well treated and taken care of... Mattie was an excellent server!!!!,5,OpenTable Diner,Dined 6 days ago
"Way overpriced for the quality of the food. I ordered a ribeye, rare, and it was cooked well, but the quality of the meat itself was poor.   Very noisy as well. We did sit on the porch and I thought that was at least part of the reason, but when we were leaving, we walked through the main dining area and the noise level there was about the same as on the porch.  The waitstaff was great, but for some reason, it took an extremely long time for us to get our food (and it didn't appear that they were very busy). The manager came and apologized and offered us dessert on the house, which I took to mean we would each get to choose a dessert from the menu. My mistake. We didn't get to choose the dessert, instead the waiter brought us a piece of cheesecake. Pardon the pun, but that was pretty cheesy. That was the last straw! My recommendation is to go somewhere else.",3,Disappointed,Dined 7 days ago
Another wonderful meal with my fiancé! Andrew did an amazing job taking care of us. We dined on the 4th floor. Everything was remarkable. Filet was perfect! Great job Pumphouse team.,5,DHenry,Charlotte
Awesome experience...love the heated outside seating to view the water/scenery!,5,MarneekaR,"Dined on February 3, 2018"
"Second visit. Did not like being outside on a cold night. Should have been a question to me on confirmation.  Noise level was high but appreciate nothing too much could be done.  Bar staff great. Food okay, returned one plate as food cold as happened on first visit a year ago.  Wine list extensive but very few by the glass, huge negative for me as we could not have drunk an entire bottle and prices are high.  Overall, not sure we would revisit. 15 more minutes would see us in Charlotte and bigger variety at slightly lower drink prices and entrees as good for less than Pumphouse.",3,OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 3, 2018"
This is the second time we have dined here and they still have no clue how to cook a steak. I went to Pumphouse when it opened and ordered a $38 filet cooked medium. It was well done and tasted like a leather boot - I’ve never sent a meal back but considering the price of the steak I couldn’t help myself. They gave me 2 more steaks and the best one was slightly pink in the middle. Fast forward to tonight I gave these clowns another chance. I ordered the same filet and went medium rare to be safe because I heard the restaurant improved - the steak was well done again. Save your money!!!,3,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
The Pump House never fails. I had a very important client meeting with a group from Europe. A day full of meetings and negotiations topped off with a delightful meal and a glass of wine. Awesome wait staff Michael was the best!  Look forward to the next chance to take in the great food and awesome ambience.,5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"I went here to treat my dad for his birthday and I was blown away by the food, service, and overall experience! Our server, Alioune, took great care of us and I have no negative critiques about the whole night. Will be coming back to dine again!",5,OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 1, 2018"
"This is a fantastic place.  Rock Hill needed a restaurant like the pump house, I'm so glad we now have it.  The view is amazing, excellent drinks and every dish we had was fantastic.  Highly recommended.",5,OpenTable Diner,West Virginia
Food was excellent as was the service. We were there to celebrate our anniversary and they treated us well.,5,HDuke,"Dined on February 1, 2018"
Meal was good just not great. The restaurant wouldn’t survive in a major city.,3,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
The food wasn’t spectacular- crab cake was flavorless and too much pimento in other things,3,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"We had an Amazing time at the Pump House. Unfortunately, it was raining so we didn’t get to take advantage of the fantastic views they offer. However, the food, cocktails and service was more than enough to make a great evening. Clarissa, our waitress, was polite, knowledgeable and made some great recommendations. We will definitely make the trip from Charlotte again and tell our friends about it!",5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"Service was very personable and nice. The food was good,but not great! I would go again!",4,Famof4,Charlotte
"1/28/18 for Charlotte Restaurant Week with my husband and 7 year old. This was my 2nd time here. My first visit the food was amazing and I wanted to come back with my husband.  Food was beyond awesome both times. I had the Porkchop and Calamari, he had  the Crab Cakes and Shrimp and Grits.   Our waiter was attentive and gave my 7 yr old daughter an order pad to draw on. They also have a kids menu, which is affordable and makes it kid friendly;  however it is very nice and romantic, for a dinner date.   Only downside was the price of the drink menu. My drink was $13 and I didn't find it to be as delicious as I want d for a $13 drink.   Otherwise all was well and definitely a good choice for restaurant week.",5,KarriMom,Charlotte
"It was our first visit to the Pump House and we went there for our 54th wedding anniversary.  The food and service were spot on and served with a beautiful presentation.  We had an outdoor table overlooking the river and even the pouring rain couldn't dampen the occasion.  Each dish we had was perfect and our server was pleasant, attentive and informative about the menu.  It was a very positive experience and we will return and recommend it to others.",5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"Second time here.  First time it was our anniversary the 2 day brined chop and shrimp and grits where very good.  Second time restaurant week and  9:30 reservations. Food was not hot and grits were not the best.  We still had a nice time.   Very cozy,  good service and good view.",4,TLC123,Charlotte
The food was great. It was such a cool concept. We car here for restaurant week. The service was terrible. We waited 35 min for our appetizers and our serve did not even ask how our food was. He came to our table a total of 3 times and we had to ask other servers for water and questions.,3,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
Great dinner!  The restaurant decor is cool and it was a fun experience to be in such a historic building.,4,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
We came to the Pump House for Charlotte Restaurant Week with another couple.  We were all very pleased with our food.  The only complaint at the table was one fellow's ice cream was too icy.    The service was good.  We would have preferred to sit in the main dining room but it was comfortable on the enclosed terrace area.,5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
A little cold when we arrived at 5;30 but warmed up. Good dinner,4,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"Portions slightly smaller than other restaurants but definitely filling, tasty and well seasoned. Service was good and all food was delivered together and at the right temperature. Great value for the money.",5,Sunshine,Charlotte
"Chase was our server and was very knowledgeable, helpful, and polite. This was my second time visiting the Pump House in one week! Love the food, atmosphere, and how welcome I have felt each time. Thank you!",5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"This was our first trip to The Pump House and we enjoyed it. The place was quite crowded because of Restaurant Week so parking was a bit difficult. Once inside we never felt crowded or rushed. The ambience was very nice and the lighting was perfect for a special dinner. We had a drink at the rooftop bar and enjoyed that as well. I want to go back when we can see the river.  The service was impeccable and all of our waiter's suggestions were spot on.  The Calimari was excellent, the Fried Green Tomatoes not quite as good. Our main courses: the pork chop and the tuna were both delicious. For dessert we tried the Cheerwine cake and the lemon cheesecake and loved them. Our only complaint was that our table was near a door to an outside patio and was opened frequently which led to drafts. Overall, we enjoyed the evening and plan to return to The Pump House.",4,OpenTable Diner,Charleston
Great food!!! Great service!,5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
The atmosphere was wonderful and our filets were so tender they melted in your mouth.  We love it; we live near there so it’s very convenient.  A big score for Rock Hill!,5,OpenTable Diner,Western NC
"The staff was very friendly and inviting. We had an overall good experience participating in restaurant week, however both had stomach aches after dinner. Food tasted great while eating it, though.  Service was good until we got our check. The first two courses came out perfectly, but we waited at least 20 min to receive our dessert.  Would be willing to give it another try perhaps but not at full price. We were glad we came in on a promotion.",4,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"Restaurant Week so the place was packed.  Full sized appetizers, entree and dessert so it was a great value.",5,Pigeye,Charlotte
wonderful food and fantastic server. Andrew did a great job.,5,VictoriaH,Charlotte
We went specifically for Restaurant Week &amp; it was close to our house.  The food was good but the portions are different for restaurant week than they normally would be on the regular menu.  Not all restaurants make that change.,4,JamesP,Charlotte
Great food and service in a unique atmosphere.  Definitely a local gem.  An excellent experience!,5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"just great, went a couple of times this past weekend, would have gone more but I was only in rock hill 2 nights",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
We went for Restaurant Week and the entire experience was great!,5,MichaelS,Charlotte
"Food was ice cold when it came out, they took it back and food came back out warm at best for the prices they charge it should be PERFECT!!!!! My family has been in the restaurant industry since I was a child. We ate the food because we were so hungry at this point. They said they would bring out cornbread, it wasn't brought out until the middle of the meal. Waitress was mediocre at best and hard to find throughout the evening, i still tip her 20% only because she's not the chef. in a professional establishment, manager would of removed main course from tab and charged us for the rest.",2,OpenTable Diner,Miami
We enjoyed the food and service.  The evening was a little noisier than we would have liked.,5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
A wonderful Friday dinner.   Food was excellent.      Appetizers were yummy,4,prooney,Charleston
"We enjoyed our food, all dishes were wonderful and nicely presented, the service was very good, we will be back🙏",5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
This was our first time trying Ilios Noche and it was amazing. The staff was outgoing and friendly and the food was delicious! We’ll definitely be back soon.,5,RebeccaJ,Columbus
"I brought a special friend here to celebrate her birthday.  The  great service and the food both added to the occasion.  Even though we had not ordered dessert, the waitress, knowing why we were there, surprised us with a cake and candle to help us finish off the celebration.  It was a really  nice thoughtful touch to a really nice evening.",5,SusanSl,Atlanta
Great food and great fast service. Felt very professional.,5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"I have always enjoyed Ilios Noche at Quail Corners, but I thought on Saturday they were having an off night.  I don't know if they were not prepared for the number of guests or what the issue was, but the food wasn't as good as usual and the service was slower than usual too.   It was also noisier, but we were sitting close to the bar and may request sitting further away on my next visit.  Overall, it was a disappointing experience.",2,ret923,Charlotte
"I was surprised that the service was poor, and tomatoes in the Greek Country salad were mealy and flavorless.  We never seemed to be able to locate our server for another drink or silverware for that matter while our food sat in front of us getting cold.    I am hoping this was a one off scenario as I have been here many times and been and visited the original off of Providence even more. Typically, the food is fantastic and the service excellent.",3,CLTFOODYWINE,Las Vegas
They were very accommodating with our reservation. We ended up being very late. The bar staff was outstanding. Very attentive.  Grilled octopus was very good.  Will definitely return.,4,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"We made our reservations for 7:45 and were finally sat at 8:10. It was restaurant week so they had to bring in extra outdoor furniture for people to sit at so it was a little uncomfortable and cramped. We usually love Ilios Noche’s vibe and ambience but we weren’t very pleased with it this visit. The food, however, was still delicious.",4,Julie,Charlotte
Everything was delicious!  The fried zucchini chips were wonderful!  The Ilios salad was fresh and I had scallops also. We all decided we had to return soon!,5,Shellbell,London
Excellent service. Food is always very fresh and delicious.,5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
We completely enjoyed our evening. The food was wonderful and the service was outstanding. The restaurant was extremely busy and yet we were so well served that we felt like we were the only ones there and that they had plenty of time to  serve us. Thank you for a great evening.,5,RobertT,Charlotte
"The food was good food and reasonably good value, they were flexible on the menu and happy to substitute and change items.  Very good service!",4,IanF,Charlotte
"The food was amazing.  The wait staff were all very friendly and attentive, which was great for late dinner on a Saturday night during Restaurant Week.  The restaurant far exceeded our expectations for a restaurant in a strip mall.  We will definitely be back.",5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"We met friends  to try a new restaurant for Charlotte area, and we extremely well pleased with the food, service and ambience at iLios Noche at Quail Hollow Shopping Center, will be going back.",5,gwcgg,Charlotte
"Despite the fact that we were there on the first night of Queen's Feast and it was crowded, the service was excellent and the food was served hot and it was outstanding.  Definitely a good value and a great place to go.",5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"As always is the case, the service, the food and the value of the meal were all exceptional. We are never disappointed.",5,John,Charleston
"We were an early reservation on Saturday of Restaurant Week.  The restaurant was only lightly occupied when we arrived at 5:40 for our 5:45 reservation.  Still we had to wait to be seated.  The Queen's Feast menu was impressive and we were reading it when our server asked if we wished anything from the bar.  My spouse likes gimlets made with Rose's lime.  But, the server had difficulty understanding my request.  Then came back and Ilios Noche does not have Rose's.  So, we had beer.  The calimari was the best part of the meal!  My partner's chicken souvlaki was pretty ordinary.  Seemed to have good flavor, but cooked dry. My Greek ribs were definately cooked dry.  The desserts were a pecan square with ice cream  and flourless chocolate cake.    Even with the Queen's Feast deal presented to us, it seemed expensive for what it was--an okay meal, but nothing special.",3,JGwynn,Charlotte
"Love this restaurant, but we had a reservation for 7:30 and when we came in at 7:25 we heard the hostess tell someone the wait was 30 minutes.  She then acknowledge us and found our reservation.  She said it would be a few minutes, but we waited over 25 minutes to be seated and only after we inquired and complained that others were being seated.",4,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"Have been here many times. Unfortunately this time was disappointing. The bread and dessert were stale even after three replacements. Three entres were good but three scallop dinners were skimpy and very mediocre.   Having been there many times, we will give them another chance.  We have never been disappinted before this trip",3,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"Ilios Noche had excellent food! One member of our group participated in the restaurant week specials and was really pleased with the quality and amount of food offered with this menu.  The  mixed hummus appetizer was yummy, and the chicken piccata and chicken Parmesan was also a big hit! The smoked cocktail, draft beer, and Moscow mule were tasty libations.  The atmosphere was pleasant, the live music a nice accompaniment, and the overall service attentive.  It was a great experience!",5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
Dinner was beautiful AND FABULOUS!  We love this place - it is always great and the service is fun and cheerful.  The food is superb!!,5,Dixonjar,Charlotte
We enjoyed the dinner very much. A real find thanks to restaurant week. We will definitely be back!,4,DonaldT,Orlando
"Our server, Nadia, was awesome!! So attentive and right there when we needed her. And the food is worth raving about - Ilios Noches on Park Rd is absolutely my favorite local dining spot!",5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"This restaurant is super cool inside. The server atmosphere seemed to be a little jumbled. The food was ok - not loaded with flavor. The appetizers were good. I told the server I was allergic to spice and he recommended an appetizer that wasn’t spicy. I had people at the table taste it before I did, as always, and all of them said it had quite a kick. We will probably not be going back. It wasn’t bad but there are too many other restaurants to try - and others we love - to go back to one that was mediocre.",3,Lauren727,Charlotte
Wait staff made it very obvious that they wanted to get rid of us.,3,Arlene,Charlotte
"Our server Ernesto was excellent, the food was perfect and we’ll be back!!",5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"Had a great dinner, drinks and entertainment.  We were with close friends and everyone enjoyed the night at your very pretty restaurant.",5,Deanster3,New England
The food reminded me of a watered down Mediterranean cuisine. Overall it is satisfactory mainly because of the ambience,5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
The marinated lamb chops and greek fries are amazing,5,Mcriddick31,Charlotte
"The food and service were great!! However, it seemed like there was no point in us making a reservation because we ended up waiting for 50 minutes! We would have left had it not been a birthday dinner. And the hostesses looked very clueless. They gave us a wrong waiting time twice!  We would probably come back, because the service and food are great, however, not during holiday days.",3,TRsc,Charlotte
"I’m thinking this was just an off night as we have had some really good meals there.  Two of us ordered Chicken Piccata and one had a huge breast of chicken and the other an extremely smaller portion.  No broccolini as stated on menu, but they did bring it out when requested.  It was just bland, but again, I am hoping this is a one time thing.   Excellent service as always.",4,CLTDiner,Western NC
Our server Marco was amazing. He was extremely attentive and helpful when deciding on drinks and food. Loved his sense of humor also!  The food was delicious.,5,FoodieBabs1950,Charlotte
"Our waitress work hard for us to get the perfect glass of wine.  Food presentation, taste and temperature were 5 star.",5,AlfredP,Charlotte
"Everything was delicious except for the big disappointment of the one item we dined here, for - the grilled octopus. It was VERY  burned and some pieces were completely wasted as we couldn't eat them at all  because it was totally charred 360°and through to the middle. The pieces we could eat were extremely bitter because of one side of each piece being burned beyond recognition.  We should have returned both orders; yes we payed $28 for those two orders; we were taking another couple out to eat and they didn't want to make a fuss because we were treating them, so they kept insisting that they would just eat it. We should have returned it.  We've never had a problem here  before with the grilled octopus, it's always been perfect and honestly,  it's the only reason we took this couple there.  The chef never should've let it go to the table. If he messed up, leave it to the staff if they feel like eating it;  he should've prepared us proper dishes.",4,DinaK,Charlotte
One of our favorite restaurants.  Love the lamb soulvaki and awesome cosmos!,5,TheChairman,Charlotte
"great food and service, our server was very attentive to all our picky needs.",5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"Our server was very attentive but interrupted way too much.  Every time he came to the table, to give us forks or take away plates, he interrupted our conversatiion.  It felt like the meal was about him and keeping things moving rather than our enjoyment.  The food is great.  Among the four of us we had ribs, salmon, spinach pie, lamb burger and a Greek salad.  All wonderful.",4,CltMM,Charlotte
Very busy that night.  Service was still good and food excellent.,4,willIeat,New England
Went with kids and both the food and the service was great! The kids menu is amazing!!,5,OpenTable Diner,Washington DC
Wonderful atmosphere. Great food and wine list. Fabulous waitstaff. Can't wait to return.,4,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
Overall good experience. The wait time for cocktails needs improvement.,4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
This place is worth the drive from where ever you live.  Staff is kind and attentive.  Can not wait to have my next meal next to the river.,5,Kdrh,Charlotte
"Fabulous venue and views. Very good wait staff; food needs to improve.  Really want this restaurant to thrive and don't mind paying a premium for a good meal. However, the food was disappointing. Fried green tomato starter was bland except for the cheese topping; paid $21 for shrimp and grits and only had 3 shrimps included in the dish. This restaurant will become a place to grab a drink only for me unless their food catches up with their wait staff and ambiance.",3,Love2eatout,Charlotte
"First time in my life we didn't have a family meal ON Easter. Everyone was either out of town or working so we are celebrating later. However, it was nice to have a meal cooked for me/us and a great place to dine. Great idea using the old pump house for a restaurant. My dad worked at the Celanese for years so it had sentimental value as well. Fun day with my Sweetie...a nice change!!!  👍👍👍",5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"I was a little disappointed in the limited menu items.  Service was slow but I know that they are new and probably still getting settled. I will try it for dinner and see if it is better, if not, probably will not return - I give every new restaurant the benefit of the doubt and try at least twice before writing it off.",3,FunGroup,Charlotte
"The Pump House is a great restaurant. This is a GEM for the City of Rock Hill. Great views, great service and even greater food. This restaurant is big city caliber. All four adults cleaned their plates and had NO complaints whatsoever.",5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
The scenic was good. The service was great.  The amount of food for the price was not good. Our tab was $82 with 2 entrees and 2 cocktails. I recommend they should serve a meat with an actual side rather the veggie decor sides. No salad or soup. Only 2 muffins and the muffins came late after sitting for 15 20 minutes.,3,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
Really good experience overall.  It's about time we got something like this South of Charlotte.,5,Dusan,Charlotte
"Pump House by a far margin is the best upper middle to high end restaurant in the area.  Nothing comes close to the food, scenic view and service.  I highly recommend it and will definitely be back.",5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"We celebrated my wife's birthday with 10 of our friends last night.  What a treat.  Dinner was late for us seniors, but was worth the wait.  Service was excellent and the food outstanding.  Our group ordered a number of different items and all were excellent.  We plan on returning and trying other items on the menu.  Our trout with crab meat, was shared, was heavenly, cooked perfectly.  We started with a shared salad, since we have cut back the amount we eat to avoid having to diet and there was more than enough for both of us.  If this is the initial start of the Pump House, management did their homework and their success will be assured.",5,Kingray,Charlotte
"Went for Sunday brunch recently with my fiancé , which took 2 HOURS from the time we sat and left. We waited several minutes before our server came to the table. We did get drinks quickly after ordering, however that was the only thing fast about the experience. While sitting outside was nice, we were sitting on the third floor and a child on the fifth floor was throwing small rocks down, nearly hitting us. After we finally ordered our food and waiting for at least 30 minutes, we noticed tables on each side of us had sat down after we did and already got their food. At that point we figured the server must have forgot to put our order in but she never apologized or acknowledged our food had taken so long to come out. The table behind us even requested to speak to the manager or owner to complain, and he did come out to speak with the table. The owner then walked past our table but stopped at every other table on the patio. Not sure why the owner decided to not ask us how our experience was because I would have loved to explain how long we waited for our food. The food was good, but for the price was not worth it. Portions were small. This was my second visit to the Pumphouse, the first was in the first week of opening. Service was extremely slow that night as well but I gave them the benefit of the doubt being brand new and very busy. However, after going again on a quiet Sunday morning and service still being terrible, I see nothing has improved. Not sure when I will be back, if ever, except maybe for drinks and a view. Disappointing for a place with such high expectations.",2,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"New, still working out the kinks.   Atmosphere is great.",4,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"Overall our experience at this newly opened restaurant was good. The calamari was great, as was the filet and the half chicken.  While they seem to be working out some opening kinks, we felt they were very attentive, even constantly referencing us by name to help make our dining experience a little more personal.   And while our server was great overall, we did offer the suggestion that she pay attention to the empty wine glasses and offer to top them off regularly - would have been a nice touch instead of us having to pour our own.  The bar on the top level is small, but offers a nice view and some great drinks and apps.  This is definitely a high-end restaurant for the Rock Hill area, but worth it.   We look forward to going again soon.",4,DavaniEscargot,Charlotte
"Lovely view of the Catawba River from the 5th floor bar.  Food was delicious, service was good.  We'll be back!",5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
We dined at the restaurant on the third night post opening.   Unfortunately the food was cold and even though we had a reservation we were seated in the bar which had a large group who had rented it out.  Hopefully next time will be more enjoyable.,3,JamesW,Charlotte
"Great food, service and atmosphere! Can't wait for my next visit.",5,smfood,Charlotte
"I was pleasantly surprised with how good the food and service was, especially considering that the restaurant has been open for less than a week.   We will definitely be back!",5,OpenTable Diner,Charleston
We enjoyed dining in a beautiful place with an exceptional view of the river.  The filet minion was cooked perfectly and the shrimp and grits were delicious.  The next time we go we want to  try the calamari.  A perfect place for celebrating a birthday for a special person.,5,OpenTable Diner,Raleigh
"Unique ambiance, very cool setting right on the river.  Food was very good.",4,PappyRick,Charlotte
Fantastic!!!! Rock Hill is so fortunate to have The Pump House! Cannot wait to go back!!,5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"Beautiful restaurant. Very unique. Great view of the river. The food was amazing, we had the pork belly appetizer, crazy good. Excellent wine list and cocktails. Definitely check this place out for your next dinner out.",5,boulderdash,Western NC
Great food and service!,5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
Went opening week. We had a great waiter but the kitchen was very slow. So was the bar. It took about 15 minutes to our drinks. 45 minutes to get our appetizers. Pretty expensive place. Food was pretty good. Sides are ala cart. I had the trout with crab. Wife had shrimp and grits. Shared fried grenn tomatoes and salad. It was over $100 for the two of us. Pretty neat view of the Catawba River from this 5 story revitalized pump house. I may give this place another shot after they work the kinks out.,3,FortMillguy,Charlotte
"Food was good, but not exceptional - especially considering the entree prices. A little taken aback by the slightly sloppy dress of the waiter, though his service was fine. We sat outside on the main level and had a nice view of the river. Might be a good place for a group of people outside on the rooftop bar level.",3,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"After a few attempts to book a table, we booked a delightful mother's day dinner!   It was worth the wait!  Excellent service and food.  Perhaps the timing of the prep was just a bit off, parts were very hot and others cool, on the same entrée. None the less we will be back for more, and more again.  This would be an excellent place for a business dinner for up to 4.  Looking forward to the next visit!",4,BCChuck,Milwaukee
we loved the brunch they had to offer! good prices and kid friendly during those hours. we will definitely be back for a romantic dinner! love this place. my in laws love it as well! they took their friends there for a nice dinner and went back in the same week to have a nice dinner by themselves.,5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"Chef's special was a pork chop.   I  would not normally order this, but decided to go with it.  So glad I did.  It was delicious.  The sides were equally as good.  I will order this again!  Finally, the homemade gelato was fantastic...I highly recommend this.",4,Baxter2013,Charlotte
"Our first time at the Pump House did not disappoint. We ordered fried green tomatoes,  sliders, carolina greens salad,  and the pork chop. Sliders were good but nothing special, but the tomatoes, salad and pork chop were delicious. The service was outstanding...our waiter constantly checked in on us but didn't hover.  I debated ordering the bloody mary and our waiter quickly offered to let me try it and told me I could send it back if I didn't care for it.  I did care for it. :)  We sat outside on a beautiful night with a lovely view of the river. Can't wait to go back with friends.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Food was very good, but a limited menu and expensive for the amount of food served.",4,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
Food &amp; atmosphere was great!  Service was a little slow - seemed like it was a new place and things were a little disorganized.  We weren't in a hurry so it gave us lots of time to visit but our lunch took nearly 3 hours.,4,CarolS,Philadelphia
My wife wanted to go to this spot since it opened but we were unable to get a weekend dinner reservation. So we went to lunch for Mother's Day. I can see why it's hard to get in. It was a limited menu for lunch but it was fantastic. And the view is by far the best in town.,5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"Best for drinks and views from rooftop. Pork sandwich was small, overpriced.",2,GoHokies,Charlotte
We had the calamari for the appetizer and it was great along with the complimentary cornbread and peach butter.  For dinner I had the shrimp and grits.  The shrimp were cooked well but the grits were too thick.  My date had the pork chops.  He said the sides were great but the pork chop was tough.  My bloody Mary I ordered was delicious though and you could tell it was home made.,3,CaitlinT,Charlotte
"Had a 2 pm reservation. No table available when We arrived. 15 minutes after reservation we were seated. Waitress Very Nice! My burger was good but fries were greasy. Desert was very good! My wife liked Her meal. Over priced for what We ordered. I looked for Fire Exit as We went in. Very narrow and tight. Outside probably OK, Catawba River at this location is far from senic.",3,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"The view and ambiance are fantastic. Service was prompt and attentive. Food left a lot to be desired, my burger sliders were completely over cooked and dry.",3,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"I brought my Dad.  He and I ate a four course meal and had a few drinks before, during and after.  Food was great!  The fried green tomatoes were quite a treat!  No complaints!!  Oh, the view is so incredible!!",5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"The food was very good.  However, we had a reservation at 7:45 and did not get our food until almost 9:30.  We watched other tables around us get their dinner and dessert and they were seated after we were.  The manager did apologize and offer to comp dessert.  So we ordered that and it took another 45 minutes to arrive.  We had high hopes but ended up very disappointed.",3,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"The food was just ok. For the price of the food and the decor of the place I would of expected better food. My husband ordered the filet mignon. Chef recommended  medium rare which my husband agreed with but it came out well done. His asparagus was not cooked more than a 2 min blanching. My shrimp and grits had too much stuff on top such as the bell peppers, coleslaw &amp; sprouts. The flavor and essence of shrimp and grits was lost in all the extras. Calamari could have used a wedge of fresh lemon. Overall the food was edible, restaurant was beautiful and service was great.",4,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"The restaurant was extremely nice, the food was good but way over priced.  I realize it's not Outback, but if the food was more realistic in terms of price we would come there more often.  The scenic view was amazing, which is what your paying for; I get it.  I would try and cater toward middle class couples, I will personally spend more in the course of month at Outback just because of price alone.  My wife and I eat out almost everyday, we only do $80 for a meal maybe twice year.  We will spend over $4000 at Outback this year alone, just a thought.",3,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
Everything was amazing from the food to the service. I will definitely be back again real soon! 10/10 would recommend!,5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
This was my highly anticipated first experience with The Pump House. We sat outside and enjoyed the views of the river as the sun set. The food was very good and the menu had nice options. Can't wait to come back and hang out in the bar area.,5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"We had great expectations for this restaurant.   At initial arrival, we found the dining space to be very small and might have been considered quaint, except that it is extremely noisy inside due to all the hard surfaces and close proximity to other diners.   First indication there would be issues came when the waiter said they didn't have any fresh cornbread ready and would bring some later. He followed that up by letting us know that there was only 1 order of the Scallop Special remaining, so one person could have those. It was only 7:15 pm.   Our waiter was pretty inattentive, while others seemed to be getting good service. My wife order the hanger steak - it was tough. I had the 1/2 chicken (it was more like a 1/2 sparrow) with generic coleslaw that looked like it came right out of a US Foods container and undercooked rice. My son and his girlfriend had the stuffed trout and they enjoyed it. So one out of three on the entree items.   Final nail in the coffin came when I had to ask our waiter to clear our table and then bring us a desert menu. After he took the time to give everyone a menu, he proceeded to tell us that only dessert available was the cheerwine cakeere available, they had run out of everything else. Again, it this wasn't a late night reservation. How can you run out of things like these on a Monday at 7-8 pm?  For 4 people, with no alcoholic beverages and no deserts, to have a bill of $120 before tip and it be this mediocre an experience, was very disappointing.",2,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"My wife and I celebrated our 31st anniversary with you.  It was awesome!  The food, the service, the atmosphere, it was a night to remember.  We will be back...soon!!",5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"Wife's salmon and my filet were delicious; hate to brag about a ""simple"" salad, but I really enjoyed mine.  Very attentive servers; wonderful view; nice atmosphere.  Need to work out a glitch -- we kept getting our food in ""to-go"" boxes even though we were expecting to dine in!",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Went for my anniversary. Started at rooftop bar, beautiful views and setup. Bartenders were not very responsive or knowledgeable. For example, the first bartender took my order made part of it then went and took care of two waitress orders then came back and finished my two drinks. The second bartender had never heard of a french martini and had to look it up in a book (and did not make it well), would expect a place at this level to know more. The first bartender then left us hanging again trying to close out our tab to go down and have a little gab fest with the rest of the staff at the other end of the bar (at 7pm at night with the place getting busy). We did order the fried okra appetizer for the bar menu and it was good.  The experience completely turned around once we went downstairs to eat. Great ambiance, and our waitress and the manager that assisted us in a wine selection were fantastic. Service in the dining room was 180 degree change from the bar. Food was very good, wife had shrimp and grits and I had the salmon. Salmon was fresh and cooked perfect. The corn muffins that they serve as table bread were also really good. They were out of the dessert I was wanting to try (strawberry rhubarb hand pie), so will have to try that on the next visit.  Overall will definitely try it again, but really hope they find some bartenders that reflect the level of service and experience the place deserves.",4,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
Great food... nice view,4,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"I first visited Pump House about one month ago for my boyfriend's birthday.  We were early for our reservations, so we went up to the rooftop bar.  We waited for about 20 minutes before a server came over to take our order.  Once our food arrived, my boyfriend's calamari was chewy and the ""worse that he's ever had.""  I ordered the fries and they were soggy and lacked flavor.  I wouldn't recommend either menu item.  We finally went downstairs for our dinner reservation, but was told that there was still a wait because others checked in before us.  We left after waiting for 20 minutes.  This was a horrible first impression.  My boyfriend decided to give them another try, after his manager continued to rave about the place.  We arrived a few minutes prior to our reservation time and still had to wait about 10 minutes after our reservation time to be seated.  Service was still slow and I had to ask a manager for a drink refill.  Overall the food actually tasted pretty good (I had the pork chops with the hopping john and greens), but the experience put a damper on my visit.  This place will need a few more months to work out the kinks and to hire servers that move a little quicker and are more attentive.  Give it a few months and you may have a 5 star experience.",3,MoniqueInQC,Charlotte
"Brunch was amazing with beautiful views over the Catawba. Our server was attentive, but not obtrusive. I was impressed and will be back!",5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
First time visit and it did not disappoint. Every aspect of the place was top notch.  Great beer selection and roof top bar the bomb! Will visit again. Highly recommend it.,5,Gator,Charlotte
I was excited to see a new restaurant opening in Rock Hill but the Pump House really fell short. The food was sub-par and the service was terrible. Our whole meal lasted about 2 hours and 50 minutes which was amazingly long. We were never offered more wine or water and sat for about 45 minutes just waiting on the waiter to come back and take our dessert order. Finally my husband flagged him down but he looked so overwhelmed.   The food was nothing special and very overpriced. I know this is a new place but they really need to get their act together. I will not be revisiting or recommending the Pump House.,2,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"We arrived 45 minutes ahead of our reservation to enjoy the outside ambience.  There were no tables for a party of five on the fifth floor rooftop bar according to the receptionist.  The largest party they could accommodate was a party of four.  So we waited in the third floor dining/bar area.  A vodka gimlet turned out to be a vodka martini with an olive in it.  The cocktail menu was disappointing.  After being seated, the first course was the ""Carolina Green"" salad which was missing the red onion marmalade and hardly any champagne vinaigrette.  The east coast oysters were bland.  The entrees were no better.  The crab stuffed NC trout was lacking crabmeat, had burnt skin, and little if any chorizo cream.  Presentation was poor.  Two ordered the shrimp and grits. The shrimp had no flavor and the grits lacked any seasoning. Our server was sympathetic and the manager apologized for the long delay between courses.   Several desserts were provided at no charge due to our disappointment and food left on the plate.  It is also marketed as upscale gourmet dining.  It is more of a neighborhood hangout.   We will not return.",2,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"My date and I really loved the ""ambiance"" of the place.  The owners went all out making it a pleasant, fine dining establishment.  We had the salmon and the ""Hanger Steak"" with the salmon being the outstanding winner.  I typically do not like salmon but this time was different.  The hanger steak was another story.  I was just plain tough and not up to standard.  I would suggest replacement with a prime NY Strip or rib eye.  I certainly would not order the hanger steak again.  I was also surprised that a restaurant of this caliber didn't offer a ""special of the day"" entree.  Service was about an 8 on a scale of ten.   The bar was quite impressive with its decor and view of the Catawba River.  The restaurant is just starting up and hopefully will get its food offerings up to snuff.  I would go back ""in a minute"" to have dinner or go to the bar.  The Pump House is a potential top shelf winner.  Oh, and by the way, get rid of the out of place Pump House signage covering the building and replace with something that says this is a fine dining establishment and not a sports bar.",4,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"Filet was amazing. Crab stuffed trout was delicious. We tried to go to the rooftop bar after dinner, but it was packed. Definitely a great date night/special occasion place!",5,Lewinche,Raleigh
Enjoyed the food and the view. Was a great experience with good service. Loved the corn bread!,5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
Worth the drive from Charlotte. Good food. Interesting menu. Attentive service. Great views and ambience.,5,Ganje,Charlotte
"The overall ambiance, decor, idea gets A+...service gets an B+..food gets a B+. (Taste well, small quantity for price), pricing gets a D, too pricey for size, and variety gets a C... Need more salad, sandwich options....",4,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"We went to the Pump House for dinner on Monday night. The place was not too crowded which was  good thing.  We had multiple appetizers (Tomato bisque, sliders  &amp; charcuterie plate)  and wine. Everything tasted great! The waiter was extremely nice and was coming to our table to see if we needed anything at the right time.  The view on the Catawba made the experience even better!  I would definitely recommend that place!",5,Mathilde,Charlotte
"We recently relocated to the area and after several friends and colleagues suggested we go...we had two rather disappointing dinners.  The food is just OK.  The steak is not very good.  Once watery.  And the second time mushy and chewy.  I can't figure out why my friends and colleagues rave about their steak.  The fish is OK.  The food is not prepared well consistently - the fish my husband ordered was cooked very well the first time he ordered, and when he ordered the same dish on a different occasion it was completely dry.  When we asked our waiter for a new dish, he looked at us and simply said that no one had asked to send a plate back before.  My husband did his best to consume his fish.  On the flip side, we've been to the upstairs bar a few times.  It's nice, cute and usually not very crowded.  It's a great place to just hang out with the two of us or with a small group.",3,GenerousPour,New York Area
"What am amazing meal! Everything was so elegant and tasty! Ask for Jess, she's an out of this world waitress.",5,OpenTable Diner,Portland
The food was excellent and the service was a bit slow but very friendly. It is a bit pricey but the portions were decent. Would go back again.,4,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"Upscale dining, good food and scenic view.  What more can you want?  Will be back often.",4,Baxter2013,Charlotte
Restaurant is relatively new; the menu is a little short but food was excellent. Service was great. Food was out much faster than I expected. I highly recommend.,5,BobbyW,Charlotte
I took my wife to the Pump House at 3:00PM for her birthday.  The food very good but we were planning on having a dinner.  We were advised that dinners are not served until 5:00PM so it was somewhat disappointing.  The receptionist acknowledged that it is was my wife's birthday which I noted on the reservation but our waiter didn't seem to know that it was special occasion. I highly recommend the restaurant but you need to be aware of their hours.,4,RaymondH,Charlotte
Great little hidden gem in Rock Hill.  Food was fine.  I only had a salad from the brunch menu so I can't fairly judge.  View is really neat.,4,CCH35,Charlotte
We thoroughly enjoyed everything we ordered and our wait person was a good combination of professional and thoughtful.  Made some  good suggestions on food choices.,4,MarilynB,Charlotte
"Amazing food, service (Matthew was exceptional), and ambiance. Be sure to order a Bloody Mary, it was one of the best I have ever had",5,guest78,Charlotte
"Enjoyed everything about The Pump House. My only complaint was the food was good, but not outstanding for the price. The place is beautifully done and the view on the river outstanding, especially at sunset! Service was very good. Two owners/managers came by the table to say hello and the server was excellent. My recommendation to the restaurant is to work on the menu/food quality...for the price, people expect more and I really want to see this restaurant thrive. My recommendation to prospective patrons is to go...it's an outstanding and special historic place repurposed in a very cool way. Positioned on the river, the views cannot be beat. Happy to have this place in my neck of the woods!",4,mlo10,Charlotte
Service was excellent with Mike.  Food very good - shrimp and grits as well as filet.  Prices were reasonable and whole staff seemed poised to give good service.,5,WilliamW,Charlotte
We very much enjoyed our first experience here.  We will definitely return.  What a great addition to the Rock Hill/Fort Mill food scene!!,5,Frannie,Charlotte
Excellent food as well as service,5,Dinner,Charlotte
"PH is overrated. We had an early reservation time because that's all t.hey had. The place was not busy but they gave us the worst table in the house. No view of the river and next to the patio door. We got a rush of hot humid air every few seconds when it opened. They moved us upstairs where at least one of us had a view. Again there were better tables open. The server was good but as dinner rush took over she had too many tables to serve and it is very crowded. The food was all a little too much. Too much breading on FGT, too much seasoning on the crostini, oil on the shrimp cocktail(weird). The skinny dipping cocktail was fab but that was it. Not worth the drive from Charlotte.",3,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
Awesome service/food and location couldn't be better overlooking the Catawba River.  They were thoughtful enough hand write a card celebrating our 10 year anniversary when we told them we were celebrating.  Definitely will return!,5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"My wife and I went to Pump House for our 5th anniversary.  The restaurant overlooks the Catawba River and offers scenic views.  It is definitely a place for fine dining or special occasions, as entrees run about $25 per person.  Portions were decent and service was excellent.",4,JeffreyK,Charlotte
From the time I walked in my visit was fantastic. I was greeted right away by the hostesses and showed to my table right away. We requested a table by the window and had no problem getting a nice view. We started out with the fried green tomatoes which had pimento cheese on top that paired very well with the tomatoes. Our server had the best recommendation throughout the whole process and was happy to walk us through the menu. I ended up ordering the salmon and my husband ordered the chicken. We were so impressed with the food that we asked to speak to the chef and our server got him. Michael was so kind and answered all of our questions without hesitation. A manager came by the table to ask how everything was. It's nice to know that people actually cared about our experience. We will definitely be returning and recommending the restaurant to our friends.,5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"We had heard some mixed reviews about the place from friends but were determined to try it for ourselves.  We shared the calamari appetizer, which was good. Slightly salty, but fried perfectly.  We then had the salmon over bacon grits. Salmon was cooked to a beautiful medium rare and tasted wonderful. We also tried a side of the fried okra. These were the best I have had, anywhere. Perfectly battered and fried. I could have eaten a whole plate.  The only place they could improve upon is the dessert menu. We tried the peach dish and the chocolate cake. The dishes were underwhelming after such a great start. The cake wasn't a cake, it was a fudge. It was very hard and too rich. The peach dish had too many components,  and the peach got lost, however, they do have some amazing homemade granola. This would have been perfect crumbled over the peach ice cream/sorbet.",4,AngelaM,Charlotte
"Our first visit to the Pump House with friends. Building and decor was very interesting being built in a former pump house located on the Catawba River. Food was good but portions were a on the smaller side. There was some confusion over the dessert menu as we heard they had just rolled out a new menu but menu we received presented an item that had been rotated off the menu. Service was a bit slow as felt like they were understaffed to handle the number of tables they had filled. After dinner we went up to the rooftop for some views of the sunset and some drinks. Once the sun set the bugs were out and annoying. They were attracted to the lights they had on around the fireplace. Could have done without them. Not sure we will be coming back anytime soon. Also, as an aside if you are coming to the restaurant via car service be careful on the return as this is not a heavily populated location and not readily serves by Uber or Lyft.",3,BallantyneFoodie,Charlotte
"The Pump House has a wonderful ambiance. Outdoor seating over looking the Catawba River provides a great setting. Our food was hot , tasty and wonderfully presented. Very good  service and a vibrant atmosphere made for an enjoyable experience. We had dinner on the third floor and then went up to the fifth floor bar for dessert and an after dinner drink.  We were pleased with the entire evening.",4,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
My first time eating here and we loved it! The fried green tomatoes with delicious warm pimento cheese were amazing! Great atmosphere and wonderful service.,5,Luv2eat,Charlotte
"My friends and I had a lovely Sunday evening at The Pump House!  Our waiter, Mike, was outstanding!  We were pampered by several staff members including Lawson who delivered the food and Hannah who cleared plates away.  Two managers stopped by to make sure we had everything we needed!   The Pump House has several floors which you can reach by its glass elevator.  We dined on the main floor which is 3.  They also have a private dining area on 4 and a roof top bar on 5.  We toured the rooftop bar after dinner.  It is beautiful!  It is surrounded by safety glass and has comfortable furniture and an outdoor fireplace.  It would be a great place to enjoy tapas and a drink with friends while taking in the view of the Catawba River.  The Shrimp and Grits were fabulous as well as the salmon and crab stuffed trout.  The sauces and toppings were perfectly matched and well presented!  We can't wait to go back!",5,ROAN,Charleston
"The Pump House has a great location on the Catwba river with a wonderful view. We visited the restaurant for Sunday Brunch, the greeters were very pleasant they seated us quickly, our server was also  Pleasant and very helpful. We ordered one  quiche, one pork belly omelette, One chicken sandwich  and onion soup which was rather bland in comparison to onion soups we've ordered from other establishments,  the quiche was so so, while the omelette was good apparently Im not a fan of pork fat.  Chicken sandwich was very juicy and delicious we would order that chicken sandwich Again.",4,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"Went for my birthday and it was extra special. Service was on point, food, drinks and dessert all tasty. Great experience.",5,KellyT,Charleston
"The restaurant was very nice and the view of the river was so nice.  The food good, but the menu is very limited.  Need to have more dinner choices.",4,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
The food was outstanding! We got the salmon and the shrimp and grits! Would definitely recommend the Pump House. The service was wonderful and the scenery was beautiful,5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"I loved it all...the ambiance, the service and, of course , the food! I was totally impressed with the attention to detail from start to finish. There is nothing like this in Rock Hill or York County and is a true welcome addition to our community.  Kudos and many thanks to the investors/partners who brought this restaurant to life! I will be back, bring friends and speak your praises:)",5,LMN66,Charleston
"View is spectacular, but the food is not up to expectations.... Staff continues to struggle with presentation, cooking temp and timely service.  Every time we go the food and service are getting worse, not better.",2,OpenTable Diner,Philadelphia
"The food was good, but the prices are extremely high, especially for wines and desserts, neither of which are worth it.  Nice place, but probably won't come back given the cost.",2,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"Thank goodness someone has brought a fun, delicious , quality restaurant to this area.  After finally scoring a Saturday evening reservation, we enjoyed our evening with friends at The Pump House. The setting is great, unique and unexpected.  Our food was very good, well prepared and well presented. I was disappointed with our dining location which seemed to be an alternate party area on a different floor. The main dining room has the atmosphere I expect, this alternate area was lacking. The inclosed rooftop bar is also a better setting, but was very loud, it could use some acoustic enhancement. The outside decks would be a better choice when the South Carolina heat was not so oppressive. Management seemed to be ever-present , very politely checking with our table to make sure everything went well. The menu is a little limited, but we were happy to hear of an additional special entree. We'll be back!",4,Mickey,New York Area
The lunch menu was a bit disappointing. Very few items on the menu. Not many healthy choices either.,3,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
Very nice restaurant.  Our particular server was a bit over attentive (gushy?) and a bit slower than others.  We still had a nice dinner and were out in about 90 minutes.  Others who came after us left before us.  Nice view from many tables.,4,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"Our second time here and feel there's still a ways to go.   Service was very good; however wines by glass were overpriced, and my pork belly did not have the crispy outside/ tender inside that is the hallmark of the dish.  Will wait a bit before returning.",4,Jimbo,Charlotte
Food is fair.  Trying too hard to reinvent the wheel on too many selections,3,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"We finally have a place to go other than Charlotte!  Great food, ambience, beautiful views! Loved everything from the top floor bar to the the dining room.  This is a must go for special occasions or just a treat.",4,JoyceC,Charlotte
"Our server was training another.  What a mistake.  We were drinking water.  And out of water most of the meal.  The server came back one time.  Not interested in paying attention during the order.  Cornbread was cold.  Shrimp and grits contained 6 shrimp.  Not worth it.  Over priced.   Nice building, uncomfortable chairs at the top floor.  I like that the building was saved, restored so to speak, but I didn't see any information on what it was really like  before the restore.  A few photos.  In the lobby, would be nice to have more information on the building.  I appreciate that you came to rock hill and I think the restaurant has potential, just need to attend to the details.",2,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"We had read mixed reviews but decided to try.   Beautiful view of the river, service was good and food was great!   Toured upstairs bar which was closed -- another beautiful view!    Will definitely visit again!",4,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte

We had a lovely time catching up and never felt rushed. The food was delicious and more than plentiful!",5,Yummy,Charlotte
"My husband and I arrived 10 minutes before reservation. We were asked to go upstairs and have a drink till it was time for our reservation.  By the time we were served our drink, it had been 10 minutes, a woman came to get us to go to our table.   We were asked to pay for the drink there before going to our table.     Our table was outside the kitchen when there were several other tables open. I should have asked to be placed someplace different but didn't get much of an opportunity.   Everything went great until we ordered dessert. Waited over 20 minutes while we watched the table next to us order and receive the same desserts we had ordered. The strawberry rhubarb pie was cold.",3,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"What a great dining experience.  Loved sitting outside overlooking the river.  We arrived early and went to the bar until our reservation time.  The bar let the dining room know we were there and when our table was ready, a young lady from the dining room came up to the bar and personally escorted us. Our waiter was excellent and personable.  The food was delicious and the restaurant had great ambiance.  This is a great place to entertain friends or for special occasions.",5,Tonkie,Charlotte
"The food was not that special. I could of honestly cooked the same thing back at the house. The waiter even mentioned a few items on the menu that he said were worth trying because of what I said in the previous sentence. The only reason why I made the noise level like I did is because they sat us next to a table full of ""woo girls"" who were doing a lot more drinking for the main dining level. The bar level on the top floor would of been perfect for them; it was quite impressive and recommend the bar to anybody looking to get a few drinks and eat. One thing to consider: the menu for the bar is a smaller version. If you want the full menu, you must eat in the main dining area. The view from the outside portion of the main dining area is outstanding! It really was perfect. However, the food was not impressive and, for the prices they charge for some of the items, recommend you look at the menu before you go to the restaurant to make sure it's really what you feel like eating. The service was remarkable and the desert was OK. If you are looking for a beautiful view and romantic setting, you've come to the right place. If you are a foodie, choose another restaurant, this is not the best for ""trying new foods"".",4,OpenTable Diner,Tampa
"We had a great time at the Pump House. The service was very good, we reveived attention at all times and the waitress was smiling and seemed happy to serve us. The food was very tasteful, great flavors and the plate was beautiful. We got a table outside with a river view and a sunset. We went to celebrate a birthday and couldn't have asked for a more perfect restaurant for the ocasion. We will definitely be back!",5,MTereza,Charlotte
"Pump house is starting to come around. They are still very young and have a lot to learn. The overall experience was great, but the food could of been better for the price that it was charged. I know they are going for a 5 star type setting, but the food has to match the ambiance you were going for. The bar upstairs still is having some trouble noticing customers and getting to them in a timely fashion. Once they fix these few things they will be good to go.",4,EdwinC,Charlotte
"This was our first time dining at the Pump House... we enjoyed our dining experience very much. Highlights: pork chop, okra, Cajun rice, wine and DeAnna's service &amp; personality. We will return.",4,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte

50th anniversary was made special by the service and attention.,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
We had eaten at Scott’s a few years ago and were really looking forward to our date night out. We were one of three couple there and out meal took over an hour to arrive at the table. It was luke warm at best and nowhere near what I had experiences before. We were super disappointed. Sure hope it was just an off night.,3,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
It was quite a nice restaurant that I had never been to before. I had heard of it when I got an invite for a presentation from a  retirement planning firm. I saved the info and suggested Scott's to friends. We LOVED the experience. The menus was wonderful and the food was done to perfection. The service was great as  well. We will definitely go again and recommend the place to other friends!,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
There were six of us who went for a Holiday night out.   The service and food was great.  We were seated right next to the live music so it was a little loud and when we mentioned he the musician turned it down and little and then followed up to be sure we were ok and could talk.  We really appreciated that.  Plus I love finding a local business to support.   We will definitely go back.,4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta

"I had dinner there Saturday night with my girlfriend at 8:30.  We were sat and one of the first things our waitress told us was we didn’t need to feel like we were being rushed because they were rearranging the main dining area for a private party.  We ordered drinks and an appetizer.  We requested an ahi app, and were told it wasn’t available.  We asked the waitress what she would recommend between the other ahi app option and the crab dip.  She recommended the ahi, so we ordered that.  She asked us for backup orders (in case others were out as well). She brought us out both the ahi and and crab dip, which we assumed was just a nice gesture since our first option wasn’t available, but we were charged for both.  We ordered the filet and lamb entrees and they were excellent.  The owner came over to offer us a dessert on the house, and to tell us we didn’t need to feel like we were being rushed. This was now the 4th time we had been told not to feel rushed.  We ordered a chocolate dessert that came with three shots of milk.  My gf had this dessert with her coworkers and they had brought kalhua instead of milk and she asked if they would do that.  The waitress said she would just bring us two White Russians, and the way we received that was it would be on the house since the dining room was being rearranged the entire time.  We didn’t  want to order White Russians, and when the bill came, they were on it as well.  Between the two drinks and the appetizer we were charged an extra $40 for items we didn’t order.  Between being told constantly not to feel rushed, and our waitress constantly prebussing before we were even finished with those dishes, it was the worst dining experience I’ve ever had.  I’ve been a restaurant GM in multiple states for over 10 years and I’ve never written a bad review in my life.  I still left a 30% tip, but spending $215 for two people, it should be a perfect dining experience.  My gf will no longer hold office parties or dinners with Scotts.",1,TravisT,Atlanta
Good food and service at a reasonable price. Music was a +,4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
I am looking for a lunch restaurant for the ladies in my group for the last Wednesday in January.  There will be between 20-25 of us but my only concern is for the ladies who will drive is to find a parking place.  It took me a while to find a place to park.   The food and the service was excellent but my only concern is the parking.,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"I went to Open Table, not knowing anything about downtown Gainesville and got very lucky with my find and selection. Miss Ann was the perfect Hostess/Server and went out of her way to provide excellent service. The food was wonderful, fresh and everything she described. Other than the Spinach &amp; Asparagus, both were slightly weak but hey....their green veggies, when you have great servings of Rack of Lamb and Fresh Seafood who cares- right? Wine, appetizers, entrees, desert and coffee were all top shelf. Scott even stopped by to check on us...great experience.",5,KnowHowe,Atlanta
great food and great service...as usual.  we eat there as often as we can.,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Great food and service and atmosphere.,5,foodie,Atlanta
"Had dinner with family. Enjoyed the private room for 4. Wine list was pretty good. Had the Duckhorn Cab ($135). Started with the wedge salad which was terrific. I had the pork chop, creamed spinach and buttermilk mashed potatoes. Wrapped up with the bread pudding. Bread pudding wasn’t so great but everything else was. Our server was very friendly and new. She worked hard for us. Dinner rolls were good too.",4,RobfromWV,Washington DC
"We reserved a table for a business meal.    Our waiter was excellent - very attentive, knew the wines and food intimately and was very polite.  The food was excellent - everyone had a steak and the next day everyone mentioned how much they enjoyed their meal.    If you are eating in Gainesville, this restaurant should definitely be on your list.",5,OpenTable Diner,Philadelphia
"The tuna-crab-avocado tower as an appetizer is always superb and a favorite;  my wife had the lobster-shrimp pappardalle, which we were glad to see is back on the menu; I had a rack of lamb that was done perfectly.   The server did a good job taking care of us.  Always a good dining experience at Scott's.",5,Jesse,Atlanta
A very pleasant evening at one of the alcove dining tables.,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
A very nice and quality meal in a refined atmosphere with great service.   A special occasion place.  I would like to have lunch sometime and compare with our deluxe dinner.,5,SladeChisolm,New York Area
"The food was well prepared and presented. We are appreciative of the accommodations for gluten free dining as my wife has food allergies. The server was a bit over taxed due to what appeared to be a lack of staff - particularly for a Friday evening.  Certainly not her fault, but it created some unnecessary delays in service. We will definitely return.",4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Great food,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Enjoyed a private room for 2. The server was wonderful as the food. Had the oyster appetizer, lobster tail and seafood grill. Very tasty. The sides were just OK but will go back!",4,Annie,Key West
"We so wanted this to be our new secret place to eat.  Had the ribeye, it was thin and not what I would call Prime, closer to a Waffle House steak.  My wife had the seafood trio, sauces tasted like something from a bottle you could buy at Kroger.  Maybe we just hit it on a bad night, food not worth the price.  The service was good and the wait staff very nice.",2,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Took friends to Scott's for the first time and was in no way disappointed.  We had a dinner nook which was wonderful for sharing conversation and ambiance.  The food was wonderful and the service was  excellent! Will be back soon!,5,Jonnie,Atlanta
"The ambiance of this restaurant was great for an anniversary. We were seated in an alcove built for 2. The crab dip appetizer was some of the best I have had. I had the rack of lamb special, and it was incredible. My wife had the prime filet, and we both thought it was the best we had eaten anywhere, both flavor and texture. The saxophone player was very good as well, and added a romantic air to our anniversary meal.",5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"My husband and I drove from Canton, GA, to have dinner with friends.  We had made reservations and the restaurant thoughtfully reserved a quiet table for us near the musician.  Great food, decent wine list, and quiet enough for conversation.  We will go again.",5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"We took some out-of-town friends who were in town for the Chateau Elan Concours D'Elegance.  We chose Scott's because we heard great things.  It did not disappoint!  The service and atmosphere was excellent;   the food awesome.  The chef came out to welcome us, inquire as to how we liked the food and ask us to return.  The music was perfect; saxophonist Brian Ulrich (hope I got his name correct) created a cool vibe.  Our guests loved it, and so did we!",5,Tony,New York Area
Food was fantastic. Fresh and well prepared with thoughtful and splendid presentations. Attentive server was charming.,5,Barb,Atlanta
"Obviously some folks like the place; menu was nice, but the sides sounded better than they tasted. Bacon Mac-n-cheese was thin and watery; rolls were straight out of a pack from Kroger (at least appeared and tasted that way). Seafood plates were just so-so.   We wanted to like Scott's, and Scott himself was very friendly, but we just couldn't recommend it to a friend. We might go back for an app and a glass of wine, but not for dinner. Sorry guys!",4,ER55,Savannah
Great food at a reasonable price! We love Scott's and look forward to our next visit.,5,Dustin,Atlanta
Tried Scott's for the first time for our wedding anniversary. We had a very private table in our own alcove with live harp music playing. They have a wonderful menu and great wine list. I had the mixed seafood grill and my wife had the sea bass. Our meals we're excellent! Their steak options looked marvelous! We got to meet Scott and enjoyed a complimentary chocolate moose anniversary tart. We'll be back!,5,Jack,Atlanta
"Outstanding!!If you are in Gainesville and want an excellent restaurant for food and service, you must go to Scotts on the Square!!!",5,jamkvick,Atlanta
"I met a friend here with the hopes of having a nice meal while we had a chance to catch up --- Scott's did not disappoint!  Our food was delicious, from our tuna appetizer to the sea bass entree I selected based on our server's recommendation. My friend's ribeye was awesome as well.  Our server did a great job of checking in frequently without being overbearing or intrusive and was also helpful in going over the wine list with us.  I'll definitely be back.",5,McKenzie,Atlanta
Excellent dinner! We were celebrating a birthday and it could not have been more perfect!  The prime filet was so tender and perfectly cooked. The scallops were truly mouth-watering and my lamb was delicious!  The sides were good with the smoked gouda grits and the risotto being standouts!,5,WifeofEagle,San Francisco
"This was our server's first day. He is pretty seasoned though. Food was excellent. We had the lamb and scallops. I really liked the onion and brussell sprouts medley. Very tasty for a gluten free diet! Thanks, we will be back to see y'all!",5,Jenny,Atlanta
Very nice place. Quiet and quick service,5,OpenTable Diner,Miami
"We started the meal with Oysters, OUTSTANDING! Our server Anne was on point with suggestions. We both had Filet, and true to discription it was fork tender. We were to full for dessert, but I will save room next time!",5,Sara,Atlanta
"Beautiful setting, great service and food!!  Nice place to celebrate!!",5,KathyS,Charlotte
"Shrimp and grits, ok.  Filet mignons (3) were not cooked to order.  On third try for one patrons filet, they delivered a filet that resembled and tasted like shoe leather.  Two bites was all one needed.  The side vegetables were covered in a very spicy blackened butter.  We asked before ordering if the butter was real spicy, and were told no.  Though one filet was removed from the bill, it is a shame this supposedly upscale restaurant does not have a chef who can gauge doneness for beef. It was rude of management to deliver the third filet cooked as it was.  Shame on the floor manager.",3,Jswbmw,Charlotte
"My friends enjoyed their salads. My Fried Green Tomatoes were ok , nothing special. They were a little bland.",5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"We did not care for the food (salmon salad and meatloaf) nor the ""regular"" tea.  It was very noisy in the regular dining room.  Private one seemed quieter.  Gorgeous view, attentive servers, friendly staff.",3,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"I have been twice to Pump House.  Each time, it was a wonderful experience.  Excellent food and service.  I am very proud of those who had the vision for creating a unique and historic venue for Rock Hill diners.",5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"Nice experience, however, the menu was lacking in choices for entrees.  If we return, we will most likely head to the top floor to take advantage of the larger appetizer menu and the ambience of that area.",4,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
LOVED The Pump House! It was our anniversary and we couldn't ask for a better experience. The food was outstanding as well as the service and the drinks!,5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
What a treat - watching the river - great food - excellent service and we didn't have to drive to Charlotte!!,5,Yogasu,Charleston
"Needs a restaurant consultant....4 at hostess table clearly 1 was the ""trainer.""  Waited 3-5 minutes while they ""discussed"" where to seat us....felt like we were interrupting their little party.  Was given to one of trainees to show us an outside table.  She was so tentative so as to be ""painful"" as she looked at her map and glanced back at trainer (who must have been there a day longer).  Dinner menu short.  We opted to have cocktails and small plates.  Old fashioned with Maker's Mark poor.  Wine good.  Slider buns dry.  Pork belly tasty.  Calamari must have been sitting awhile.  Service by Blake was terrific.  Don't know how these folks are going to make money with this kind of experience.  Best thing -- nice venue.  Owners must not have any restaurant experience.  Good luck!",3,Disappointing,Chicago
The service was horrible and the food was poor quality for the price. A very big disappointment.,1,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"Newly opened, the Pump House, so called because it used to be the source for city water from the river, is fine dining with a view.  Four stories above the river, this location provides a wonderful view day or night  They have at least 100 wines on the list, first class chef, and service that if you were picky, you might call too attentive.  There are two full bars on the third and fourth levels and with plenty of outside seating overlooking the Catawba River.  There is even a comfortable seating area witha real fireplace for chillier evenings.  Strongly recommend you cbeck it out.   Wines run fron $7 and up.  $$ fits for price level.  Superb deal for what you get.  In Charleston this would be $$$$.",5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
Great service from the start. We had a reservation for noon and did not have to wait to be seated. Stephen our waiter was very attentive and the food and drinks (bloody Mary's) were delicious.,5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
Excellent service and Excellent food! We will be back.,5,ChipB,Charlotte
This was our second dinner at Pump House. Very limited menu both time dinner order wrong. This time meat not cooked as requested. Then our dessert took 20minutes to come &amp; we had already finished our coffee.  When we complained our service said manager wanted to talk to us &amp; that was the delay on dessert. We pledged we will NEVER return!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"The menu was nice and simple. We couldn't decide on which appetizer, so we had 3. Each item was delicious. The fired green tomatoes were some of the best I have had.",5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"The food was very good (maybe a tad but overpriced) but still good. Wish the menu was a bit more extensive, but what we had was very tasty.   And the service was excellent!!",4,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"Was a little underwhelmed at menu choices and quality of food. Biggest disappointment was salmon and grits. Salmon was good, but grits were really bland.",4,OpenTable Diner,Charleston
My friend and I had a wonderful lunch. We both enjoyed our sandwiches and plan to go again.,5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
My wife and I were excited to try The Pump House. We got there and we (along with others) couldn't find where to enter. And it happened to be raining. We found the lobby and figured out we probably need to use the elevator. Needs better signage. We were seated right away. Menu was extremely limited. Food was good but not great. And overpriced. It was apparent they were trying hard but we certainly could've dined elsewhere with better dishes at a cheaper price. At the end of the day we were a bit disappointed.,2,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"After seeing so many friends post from The Pump House on Facebook, with 5 Star comments, I  had to give it a try for my wife's special BDay dinner.  At 1st menu glance, it appeared pricey for this retiree. Yet the reviews led me to go here for wife's Special BDay and give it a try.  I was very, very, very impressed, with TPH!!! It's a local, classy restaurant, filled with ambiance, gourmet chef food &amp; attentive, polite service. View of river was great. I would have selected outdoor seating if it wasn't rainy. Overall, for both of us,  the value, was far greater than the cost.  We started with an appetizer.. A sizable serving of fried Calamari w/peppers, all tastefully fried to gourmet tenderness... So Goood!   My main dish,  was NC trout, [not Vietnam tilapia]. The trout was stuffed with crab meat, new potato casserole with sweet peppers &amp; roasted fennel, chorizo cream. My wife had the Filet-Mignon, cooked to HER perfection, &amp; served with red potatoes &amp; asparagus. Both were OUTSTANDING!!! But our taste buds gave special recognition to the taters that were roasted to perfection &amp; so tasty...YUM!!!   We finished off with the mini, personalized, Strawberry Rhubarb pie. The crust was perfect as it flaked open to expose the tasty sweetness of the fruit.  The presentations of both the main course &amp; desert were pure chef art... That's why we took pics for facebook post to family &amp; friends, for them to drool... HeHe..  We sealed off our meal with a glass of wine &amp; a kiss.  Thank you TPH, for an enjoyable &amp; tasty event with my wife. We will be back, for sure!",5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"Actually an old, manufacturing water pumping station very nicely converted to a restaurant and group dining/meeting venue.  Has been open only a short time but very popular already.  Somewhat limited menu but the choices they offer all seem to be what most of the public would expect to see.  Nice selection of appetizers, excellent wine list with many bottles visible  in a huge, glass-front display case.  Noise level in the main dining room was quite high when all of the tables were occupied.  Small bar area.  Outdoor dining overlooks the Catawba River.  Would definitely visit this restaurant again, perhaps for lunch the next time.",4,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"Even when raining, view was great.  Efficient, cordial service; good attention from dining room manager.  Unique location and menu items.  Food was good, but fries were not hot.  Want to try the Pump House for dinner.",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Would've been nice to know that the soup or salad came at an extra cost. Not bothered that it cost extra, just was never informed that it would. The food was very bland tasting. Not much flavor at all. For the price the taste of the food should knock your socks off. Wait staff was really good and the setting/view was awesome. If the food matched the setting, then you would have a Five Star restaurant hands down. Of course that is just my opinion.",3,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"Visit started a bit shaky with seating at wet (newly cleaned) table.  Drinks were ok, but it seems all restaurants are making their profits on drinks.  Wine list not great and very limited selection of wines by the glass.  Food was good.  Menu is not extensive, but something in every category.  Probably the best seating and ambience/view in the area.  All new and very high-end.  Definitely a quality restaurant and the best in Rock Hill.  You can get a very good meal in beautiful location, so it gets 4 stars.  Wait staff and management were very attentive.",4,Ricky,Charleston
"Everything was wonderful, but the views are amazing!",5,OpenTable Diner,Las Vegas
"We had a good time, wait staff was friendly.  We had some older people in our group and the food was too spicy for them. :)  Maybe you could offer a few ""simpler"" items.",5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
Great service and food! I enjoyed the prosciutto benedict!,5,Abigail,Charleston
"I made reservations with intentions on having a small dinner party for my boyfriend's birthday. Once I started telling ppl, the attendees quickly grew larger than the reservation. I had never visited the restaurant, so I thought I would go and take a look to make sure this was the place. From the moment I stepped off the elevator I was in ""AWWW"". It was perfect, everything I wanted for the perfect SURPRISE birthday dinner. The ambiance on every floor is amazing. The lighting, the sound of the water, the nature on the river bank added to the ambiance. I decided to talk to the manager and he informed that because our reservation was late, he would make a note for the staff to accommodate the party. The guest arrived first and they were seated quickly. When the birthday guy and I arrived we were lead to the table and he was so surprised. Deanna was out waitress and she was AMAZING! She was able to get everything right and she had a great sense of humor. The food was AMAZING and they had a great menu to choose from. This was my first, but definitely not my last visit.",5,MsDM,Atlanta
The wait staff was very nice and the service was good but unfortunately the food was terrible. I had the salmon over grits and it was way over cooked. My husband had a filet medium rare that came out well done and he had to send it back. A second steak came out and it was completely raw inside. By that point we were just ready to leave and the evening was a total bust. They did take care of our meal and we only had to pay for our bottle of wine but it was very disappointing.  We will not be recommending or returning for that matter.,2,AKBP,Western NC
Great atmosphere. Food is bland and over priced. Would be a good spot for beers with friends but nothing more. cocktail I ordered was purley tequila not mixed well at all.  For the price of everything I expected much better food and drinks.,3,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
We had a great experience Saturday with our friends! We highly recommend the grilled snapper special!,4,Otmimi,Charlotte
Great example of preservation. It is gorgeous and incorporated history with the beaver and Catawba pottery! Awesome spaces and view! Great way to turn a piece of a toxic chemical plant into a place for people to enjoy the beautiful of the Catawba River.,4,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
We truly enjoyed just about everything.  We look forward to coming back and hope to make this a place to meet friends!,5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"I took my husband &amp; out-do-town family to PH for is birthday.  We enjoyed the dinner, however the wait staff needs to pick up their game.   They are friendly and very pleasant, but extremely slow and forgetful.  We waited a longer than usual time to be greeted and for the drinks to be served.  We all thought the drinks are on the expensive side. Our dinners were very good and we liked the variety of entrees offered. The ambiance and the views are terrific. We will go back, but I do hope the service is better the next time!  Please as we are in need of a great Resturant in this area.",4,Debbie,Charlotte
The salad was excellent as well as the burgers.   The shrimp and grits only had 3 shrimp....for the price of the dish there should have been more even for a lunch portion.,3,Dinner,Charlotte
Very disappointing steak and service for a higher end restaurant.  They have a long way to go on service and food to keep up with other better restaurants.   Great view and ambience.,2,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"Have a snack before you go, make sure you have plenty of time and lots of money.",2,Goonster13,Charlotte
Great for a nice night out,5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
The food is priced a little to high for the quality.,3,Foodie,Charlotte
5 small shrimp $15. 3 slices fried green tomato $12. Chicken too salty. Ambiance good. Great views from patio. Need to look at the menu for prices. Chef needs to dial back salt.,4,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"Enjoyed the quiet, peaceful atmosphere.  Good service.  Food was full of flavor.  Also enjoyed the lovely music.",5,YildizH,"Dined on February 3, 2018"
We discovered this place a couple months ago and the food and service was excellent both visits.,4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Love the Turkish Kitchen.   So sad it’s changing over to an Italian restaurant. Their Turkish food is outstanding. Tender chicken. Great Hummus. Good selection for vegetarians.,5,Hugefoodie,Atlanta
it was my first time there and I will be back soon love the service the belly dancer is the most and everything ....@love it,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"We went to celebrate a birthday. The food was delicious. Service was excellent.  Unfortunately the table was too high, not ergonomic. There wasn't any ambience/background music from where we were seating, paired with the dark decor and lighting made the whole scene a bit too unwelcoming. Also, I was expecting belly dancing but when I asked I was told they no longer do that (even though it is still advertised on the website)  None the less, if you want to go for a quiet private evening with good food and service, it's a nice place to go.",4,VBH75,Atlanta
We were pleasantly surprised with our meal!  This exceeded our expectations. The chicken kabob was extremely tender and very tasty as was the beef kabob!  We will definitely eat here again.,4,Hugefoodie,Atlanta
This is our favorite restaurant near our home.  We recommend Turkish kitchen early and often when this we are friend with are considering an outstanding dining experience.,5,Johnson,Las Vegas
Went for a group birthday. The food was delicious!!! Our sever was excellent!! Everyone enjoyed the food and had a great time. We will definitely be back!,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
food was good but lackadaisical service the lamb is amazing and also the grape leaves,3,yummy,Charlotte
"Food was spot-on and fresh. We enjoyed all of the mezzo (dips), a few salads, etc. so delicious! Service was impeccable. He was very attentive. It was quiet in there which is a shame brocade its so good and there should be a line out the door!",5,Missy,Atlanta
I enjoyed exploring a different culture and have amazing food. Every dish was superb and we had the sampler. You have to try it!,5,OpenTable Diner,Savannah
We ate at the Turkish Kitchen after shopping at the mall. The food was excellent as was the service. We would highly recommend the Turkish Kitchen.,4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"On previous visits on the weekend there was a belly dancer, but we were told by our waiter that there is no entertainment anymore. That's a pity as several of the friends that we took there for dinner wanted to see the belly dancing.",4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
The food was very good especially the dipping oil with the bread.  The falafel was good but a little over cooked. The Fava dish was excellent. We had it with chicken but I think the lamb would have been even better.  The only disappointment was the Turkish coffee.  The service was very good with a smile.,5,outandabout,Orange County
"On the recommendation of our waiter, my date and I split the combo kabobs. It was perfect... Our entire  experience was story worthy.  🌹",5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta

It was a wonderful experience! Took my husband for his birthday and he really liked the food/atmosphere  and the belly dancer was super cool!,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Mediterranean food in  the suburbs.  No need to travel to Sandy Springs.  Close to Mall of Georgia.  Gluten free options.,3,FitFoodiefor15,Atlanta
"This is our 3rd time visiting the restaurant,  and the food was great as usual. When our waiter (Kodi) overheard that one of the people at our table was intolerant to gluten, in addition to the pita bread with the appetizer sampler, he also brought carrot and cucumber chips!  The belly dancer (Maria) was also very good, and got 3 of the people at our table to dance with her. My friends who were there for the first time were surprised that the restaurant was not full considering the quality of the food and the entertainment.",5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"I'll be honest - my review is probably negative from my own wrong assumptions.  With a place called Turkish Kitchen that advertised a 'dining experience' with belly dancing, I thought it would be more fun like Atlanta restaurants Nikolas or Taverna Plaka.  Honestly this place could use a little more atmosphere and liveliness.  The ONE dancer would come out once every 30 minutes or so and due to the layout of the restaurant, we rarely saw her.  It was not the entertainment we expected.    Food - the server was very nice and I understand we are more high maintenance from being a large party.  He did seem to be quite new too and not very familiar with drink menus, etc.  And nervous... he actually took a couple of drink orders and walked off without getting the entire table's order.    The food though was very good.  We got the hummus, varous kabobs, gyros, etc.  The highlight was my sister's dish - COMBO KEBAB (Adana, beef kebab, gyro, chicken kebab and a lamb chop).  Perfect for splitting at $30.    Bottom line - I'd come back for the food, not the 'entertainment.'",3,JNOW,Atlanta
Many dishes to choose from at great price. Very friendly server very knowledgeable about the dishes. Great place for the whole family,5,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
I eat here all the time. It's outstanding.,4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"The food was great!  Our service, not so much.  Either our server was new or did not care to be there.   We were out for my husband birthday and as parents to small children we don't get to go out very often.   To pay that kind of price you except a certain type of level of service.  Also there was a little girl ,I am assuming was the owners child at the front and walking around the restaurant.   They put us very close to the banquet hall where there was a party going on so it was  loud .  But there was open seats closer to the front where if they would have set us we wouldn't have to worry about the music. The restaurant was not full it was actually kind of slow for a Saturday night.",3,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"My husband and I wanted to try a new place to eat out! But sorry to say we were not happy with food, and service! We were given appetizers in time though but how can you eat hummus without bread? It took long to get the bread. The same thing happened with rice too.  It was not worth it!",3,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Great food, I got my reservation and all worked as expected, placen can get busy fast. Great first time impressions, we will try another dishes next time. We got margaritas, they need a lot of improvement, we will ask next time what kind of tequila they used, we may need to ask for a refined kind, they were super sweet. Michell gave us the finest service.",4,FRENG,Atlanta
Had a nice time. Very attentive staff and great Mediterranean fare.,5,ChristianS,Atlanta

Great place with friendly service. Will go back. Belly dancer added to tha night.,5,EdWhigham,Washington DC
"We had reservations and arrived promptly. Had to wait to be seated (restaurant was empty)...was sat and no one came to greet us or take a drink order. We flagged someone down to be moved to a more comfortable area (since it seemed we would be there for a while) after being moved we never had a server approach our table for 20 minutes....we got up, left and went to have a great dinner else where.  SAD!",1,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Everything was fantastic, special thanks to Ali  Food very delicious, service was very fast",5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Good food with fair price. Too noisy. Service wasn't great,4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"The food was very, very tasty. The atmosphere on the other side, lacked. The decor just slaps you in the face. But, again, what really counts is the food. Delicious!",4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"We celebrated our 28th anniversary with another couple. We had the best time and the best meal. We enjoyed Mediterranean themed appetizers and meals selections. The lamb, cocktails &amp; wines were outstanding! The baklava made the evening complete!",5,CharlesD,Atlanta

"Had such a great time at Turkish Kitchen!  Loved the food, atmosphere and belly dancer!  The owner came out to meet us and made great dining suggestions!  The food is delicious.  We will definitely be back 😃",5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Busy night in Valentine's Day. Service was slow. I'm not sure if it was our order and a table of 4 next to us, but our entrees came 1hr after the appetizer. There was a table that was seated within 30min and they were served meals to a party of 5.   Food was good. The Belly dancer was sent out twice to make up for the slow service it seems. (She alone entertained around the restaurant) It wasn't so bad to were I won't recommend or go on a regular night. I'm sure I will return because the food was delicious.",3,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Took 35 mins to get someone to take our order (yes, for a waitress to actually come to our table). Then the food came out cold (meat and rice, however bread was hot), took another 15 mins to get them to come check on us.. they did offer to remake it but after another 15 mins of waiting we told her not to bother. By the time we left, we filled up on bread and yogurt since we were hungry and didn't have a choice. Was tempted to take a date here because of the good reviews, but if they're busy don't expect to be helped much.",2,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Good was okay. The last thing I want is to be seated in front of the bar even though I made reservations.,3,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"The food, ambience, and service were INCREDIBLE!!!  I would definitely recommend this place to friends, and family.  Already planning a return trip there.  They had really good martinis, and the lamb chops were some of the best that I've ever had.  The seafood kebabs were cooked to perfection!!!  Really good food, drinks, ambience, and not to forget the belly dancing exhibition.  Turkish Kitchen has a lot to offer, and is well worth the drive!!!",5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"I really like F&amp;B for food, looks and ambiance. Very slow night so not noisy at all. Waiter was very pleasant, but disappeared for long period of time-way too long without  checking back before we ordered. Actually think they might have reduced staff due to slow business and he was handling too much, but still should have come by to see if ready to order sooner. Food tonight was good. Not great or exceptional.   They did comp a dessert to make up for service which was good except for the one lapse.",4,Rockie,Atlanta
"Excellent cocktails, great staff and really good food",4,ChipW,Dined 5 days ago
"Food was very good. Hostess was ok but seemed overwhelmed on a busy night. Surprised people were wearing everything from sour coats to hats backwards at the bar and one lady was literally in her workout stretch pants slurping bouillabaisse.   Server was hesitant but good. Biggest complaint was that the servers, busers and expedites were so rushed they kept banging into my chair. Happened five or six times. Ridiculous and never once did anyone say excuse me.   Rabbit was excellent. Onion soup very good though a tad below temperature. I’ll give it one more try but place seems a schizophrenic combo of sports bar and nice restaurant.",3,CTC4653,Atlanta
"The food was overcooked. My medium rare lamb was served medium well. I couldn't send it back, because the waiter never stopped by to see how the food was. In the waiter's defense, he was assigned too many tables.  On the plus side, the quality of the ingredients was high.",2,Atlanta,New York Area

Anniversary,4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"I was so excited about F&amp;B as my husband and I are always looking for good restaurants and we love French food.  Unfortunately, we will not be going back. Our first impression was a rude hostess (who should not be in the hospitality business).  We were obviously an inconvenience to her and didn't greet us when we walked in (she just said ""two?"") and then took us to a table, blocked me from getting to the table and didn't wish us a good lunch.  Surly!  The music was on a radio station which was playing a commercial for an Atlanta Mercedes Benz dealership -- they don't have Sirius XM?  What is this Waffle House? The waiter for our area was MIA so another guy helped us but wasn't friendly or helpful.  I felt bad for him because he seemed to be the only server on the floor.  Our tea glasses were  always empty and we weren't offered dessert.  I ordered escargot which were a big disappointment -- bland and served with thin bread toasts which couldn't be used to sop up the butter garlic sauce...which really wasn't a heartache since the sauce was pretty sad.  The onion soup was okay. For a $60 lunch, I had hoped we'd do better than ""poor"".",2,TechSquareFoodie,Atlanta
"F&amp;B was delicious, and it was a really fun time for me and my husband. It is a great atmosphere and has beautiful surroundings.",5,ClaireWB,Atlanta
"Delicious hearty food. Friendly, helpful staff. I can eat here everyday!",5,ELau,Atlanta
"The food was just ok, especially compared to other notable French restaurants in Buckhead (like Le Bilboquet, Bistro Niko, or Anis). My friends both ordered the skate, which was over floured before pan frying (possibly in oil that wasn't hot enough), so the outside of the skate wing was greasy and soggy, instead of crunchy. The portion of fish was tiny. I ordered the ribeye which was a very nice cut, but the sauce that accompanied it (some kind of oily tomato relish?) really muddied the flavor of the steak. I also ordered the steak medium, and it arrived very red and cold in the middle (definitely rare). The service was nice, but not noteworthy. For the prices, I'd head somewhere else.",3,Disappointed,Atlanta
"Great food. New decor, same comfy ambience",5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Our second great dining experience at F &amp; B. Our server, Steve, was awesome. Again, the food was amazing. Can’t wait to go back! 5 stars F &amp; B!",5,Mindy,Atlanta

Waiter was attentive and pleasant, and manager came to check on our meals and service. Very nice dinner.",5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta

"Service anywhere but the bar is slow. We waited for at least 5 minutes before our waiter greeted us, and my food came out not as I had ordered but i didn't dare return it as I would have run out of time to eat.  If your looking for a quick lunch option this is not it.",2,JakeK,Atlanta
"Great service, wonderful French food, in a casual and cozy setting. The bar scene seems to be very popular. The French onion soup was the best I have ever had and the French fries themselves were worth the trip....great burgers too!",4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"The update of F&amp;B is very good. We had a great meal at a reasonable price. Hot bread, cold fresh water, great salads and the beef Bourgogne had a great twist to it. I have been here before  as we love country French cuisine. This has improved and is worth a try.",5,Pappi,Atlanta
"As it has always been for me... pleasant, good food, ambiance, service.",4,MandR,Atlanta
"Bar scene was active when we arrived. All was fine except I only ate half of my dinner - which was really good - and asked that the remaining portion be wrapped up to take home. The server only wrapped a portion of my dinner and threw out a side item, which he could have easily replaced. When I asked about it, he just shrugged and said ""sorry.""",4,mary,Atlanta
Read other's reviews for F &amp; B and all are consistent in service is lacking...  Our waiter had to continue to return to the kitchen to get answers to our menu questions.  I noticed that another table received bread - we did not.  Our waiter removed our ice tea glasses once we received our check instead of inquiring if we wanted more.,2,MamaCooks,Atlanta
"We were disappointed to see the wonderful ciabatta bread missing. We weren't told of any specials, or asked if we wanted dessert. We were out on the porch and our waiter wasn't checking on us as much as we needed. 4 of the dishes in our group weren't cooked properly.   We love f&amp;b and hope that this is not the new norm, but an exception.",3,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"There's nothing French about it. Great room and location, but disinterested staff and below average food.",1,OpenTable Diner,Phoenix
"Our dinning experience was mixed... the bad, service is lacking, server didn't know the menu, not sure if he is new, he didn't understand our order, his english wasn't very good so it was hard to communicate, when we were ready to place our order he was nowhere to be found until we saw him thru the kitchen window playing with his phone, we asked to talk to the manager but they told us he wasn't there yet ...it was 12.30 pm and no manager onsite.  The good... THE FOOD was superb, we had the scallops, the chicken ballotine and the croque madame without a doubt the best in town,  we ate every bit of our lunch, and left wanting more, we will be back for the food, hopefully next time the service can be at the same level.",5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta

"My husband and I were in the mood for French food and found F &amp; B on Open Table.  The food was very good and was nicely presented.  We especially enjoyed the crepes for dessert.  Our server was friendly, although, busy as they appeared to have been slightly understaffed.  He answered our questions, but we would have enjoyed a more thorough exploration of the menu.  The manager stopped by all of the tables to check on guests, which is a nice touch.  If we were in the area, I would consider visiting again.",4,Jstrack,Atlanta
We've been there many times and as usual had a wonderful meal. Also discovered a new favorite wine!,4,Trishdish,Miami
The food was great. The service was excellent. The atmosphere was tomorrow at four. We really enjoyed our evening out at this fine French bistro.,5,Gene,Atlanta
"The restaurant is lovely and was quiet for a weekday birthday lunch.  The wine list is good and not ridiculously priced like many restaurants.  I elected to have the roast lamb, but was disappointed in the cut of meat.  It was quite fatty and gristly, but was very tasty and the rosemary garlic aioli was delicious.  My only complaint about the restaurant is that I didn't see anything on the web site about parking and when I arrived at the back of the building, I assumed the parking deck was where to park.  Upon arriving at the restaurant I asked if they validated the parking and then I learned that there was complimentary valet parking.  I was already late so I didn't go move my car and when I exited the garage, my parking bill was $18! Ridiculous.  So, USE THE VALET PARKING!!!",4,Luv2eat,Atlanta
We booked a reservation for Christmas day. room was one of the few places open on Christmas. The service was good but the location was very underwhelming and the food was barley warm.  The charge for the meal was 45 per person plus an automatic 18&amp; gratuity which is fair for a family style meal on Christmas day. However the barley warm entrees and the line up of desserts that included for trays of picked over desserts that looked like they had been sitting out all day with turned over pieces and trays that lacked any presentation was very underwhelming,3,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
had reservations at 1030 am on christmas---website quoted a higher price but said it was a christmas buffet--------when i got to restaurant they said they did not have a buffet--that is what i thought i was getting---------we were told it would be a few minutes before our table was ready-----15 minutes passed and nothing---we promptly left and went to the ritz carlton---won't make this time consuming mistake on a holiday again,1,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"The first thing to realize is that when you walk in, it is a dining room in a hotel lobby, albeit a nice lobby. That being said, their business is going to ebb and flow with the booking of the hotel, as it's not the most well known restaurant yet.  We were seated rather promptly, however even though there were only a few other tables in the restaurant, service was rather slow. The bottle of wine stated 2013 on the menu, however they brought us a 2014 bottle. The calamari was okay - nothing great, but hey, it's calamari.  We both ordered the lamb chops - I ordered medium rare with asparagus, my girlfriend ordered medium with sauteed spinach. The first problem is they were both medium-raw. I hope this was just the cook's first night... but they had to be sent back 3 times, and still weren't cooked (the cook probably threw them on high heat; seared the outside, left the inside raw), although the flavor was . The sauteed spinach was so salty we couldn't eat it, but they replaced it with sauteed brussels sprouts which were awesome.  Overall the flavor was great, but the execution was not there. I hope they get it together, because it's a nice ambient experience, the flavors are good, but if they can't get the execution down, they won't make it.",2,DamnRedhead,Atlanta
"The food was good quality and tasty. Little variety in the starters for a gluten free diner but made up for by the flourless chocolate cake for desert.   European size portions in general but that was good.   However, the restaurant was cold (my dining partner had to wear a coat) and the live music was far too loud making conversation difficult.",4,OpenTable Diner,New Orleans
"Terrible service - midweek night, place was mostly empty and it was as if we were bothering the wait staff. Had to ask for menus, water, after the appetizers the waitress asked if we wanted dessert - WTF? Coffee were cold , food was average - embarrassed because I recommended the place to colleagues who literally laughed the whole time because of how bad it was",2,Scott,Atlanta
The food was excellent but could pricey. The service was outstanding. The atmosphere was quiet but I believe it’s because of the time we got there as it was early evening. We were sat right around. I enjoyed dining and will go back.,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Service was not great. Frequently had to wait a long time for server to reappear,3,OpenTable Diner,Jacksonville
"I ordered a steak medium.  It came out well done.  I sent it back, it came out raw.  My friends were done eating at that point so I just sent it back.  The server was very good about it, but I left hungry!",2,OpenTable Diner,Las Vegas
First time at this restaurant and I was impressed. Very cool atmosphere and lovely service. Nice selection of sushi which was good but lots of the other choices for those non sushi eaters. Had the lamb chops and they were delish. Nice place. I will be back.,5,Foodie,New Orleans

Went for Mother's Day because I eat here for business often and been wanting to take my wife. Left after 25 minutes of no service and 4 different employees coming by the table who wasn't our actual server at the point we were then told that there weren't any high chairs for my 1 year old and nobody seemed to have any interest or knowledge on where any would be. Hostess was clueless as well. Not sure what the problem was but will be the last time I try to take my family or wife there.,1,OpenTable Diner,Birmingham
"There were not many people in the restaurant, but service was still extremely slow.",3,mary,Atlanta
"Server's attention to detail was lacking. Half of our orders were incorrect. Service was slow and kitchen was lazy when ""fixing' orders that were screwed up. Atlanta has too many phenomenal restaurants for me to have to settle for mediocrity (at best). Will not return and will not recommend.",1,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"I visited this restaurant on Sunday May 7, and it was a super fantastic experience and my family and I really enjoyed out time there. My mom is up in age so I try to plan outings with her for the family at least once a month and this day just happened to be my niece 21st birthday. This was a blind choice as no one recommended this spot (very surprised) I looked it up online by searching ""Sunday brunch in midtown"" and just drew straws and came up with this spot. I was also surprise when I was told that their business is not as busy as I would have thought with the location and that the restaurant is not advertised not even by the hotel receptionist. This should be on the top of the list for any type of event/outing of well mannered people. Definitely not a spot for loud rowdy crowds. I mention to my co-worker and she immediately book the location for Mother's Day Brunch next week. See how easy the word travels. I will be returning again for dinner soon:-) Thank you Shay and Robert for a super fantastic experience and enjoyable brunch.",5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta

"We made reservations for 5 as hotel guests celebrating my daughter's 16th birthday. When I made the reservations online, it ask d if it was a special occasion and I explained. When we arrived, they didn't have the table ready and didn't seem to check reservations (seating was still fast).   Our server was pleasant. I ordered a filet and was brought a ribeye. They offered to take it back but I didn't want it to be wasted. However, I feel I should have been charged for what I ordered, not what I was served. We sat for a very long time after our meals were finished. The kids were too tired to wait any longer so they went to bed while we waited for the server to return. We were hoping to have dessert together, and our reservation comment about our celebration went unnoticed.",3,OpenTable Diner,Charleston

"We were excited to try a new restaurant out being in downtown Atlanta for the night and wanted a nice, fun place.  The restaurant was nice, our server was very good and everyone we encountered was friendly but we just didn't think the food was that good.  I had the filet and it didn't have much flavor and the mashed potatoes tasted like they were from a box.  Didn't taste like mashed potatoes at all.  With 2 meals and 2 drinks (which they indicated an upcharge of $2.00 for each drink for ""rocks""  -- $2.00 extra for ice?!) was $100.  I just didn't think it was remotely close to a $100 meal.  Wouldn't go back here again when we're there this Summer.",4,OpenTable Diner,Tampa

"ROOM at Twelve has a classy atmosphere with all of the decorative detail you would expect from from a modern, downtown hotel lobby.  Their service was equally top-notch and attentive throughout the meal.  Unfortunately, while the menu provides a variety of fare, the food itself lacked flavor, with mediocre seasoning at best.  For the price, one expects a little more pop.  But if you find yourself downtown and looking for something predictable and mild, check out ROOM, else check-in somewhere else.",3,ClintL,Atlanta

I wish I could remember the gentleman's name who served us.  He was very proficient at his job.",4,BestATLsteaks,Atlanta
"Ate here for the first time last week for lunch with customers.  The portobello burger was the best I've ever had.  A lot of places drench the mushroom in oil, but this was light and well-cooked, and it was topped with fried green tomatoes and goat cheese:  great combo.  The atmosphere is a little staid, which is actually perfect for formal business lunches.  The decor is modern and streamlined, and it was a great experience overall.",5,OpenTable Diner,Washington DC
"Room in my tummy for food at Room at Twelve The service staff were just great , plenty of rechecks and all well timed.  Ashley , our server was warm, knowledgeable and efficient.

I had to request the chicken that was supposed to come with my salad per the menu. Once it was brought out, it was pulled chicken in a salty broth. It was so wet from the broth, that it made it hard to eat with my salad. It was such an odd combination.",3,NatON,"Dined on January 27, 2018"

The service was subpar at best. Our waiter was nice just didn't tend to us very well. They were out of the one pizza we'd been recommended to try as well as the cocktail we wanted to try.

Brezza is far too loud on the weekends. They need to find some way to control the influx of noise from Ponce market and/or master the art of acoustic tiles. We were shouting at each other.   Food was good - the kale salad is a favorite.,3,Justeatit,"Dined on April 1, 2017"
"Good food, nice atmosphere. Our waiter was charming and attentive.",4,FoodieOnSunday,"Dined on March 18, 2017"
"First time at Brezza, atmosphere was great. Service was a little slow at times, but overall great experience",5,OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 12, 2017"
"Maybe because we went on a Saturday night, and there were a lot of large parties at tables near us, but our waiter did not pay much attention to our little table of two.  A little pricey for a shared pizza, a beer and a glass of wine.  Difficult to have a conversation because of the noise level.  Might be quieter and less busy on a week night.  Ponce City Market is definitely the place to hang out on the weekend for the younger crowd!",4,Bebe,"Dined on February 25, 2017"
This is one of my favorite restaurants.  They consistently have great food and wine.  The fish  is always flavorful and prepared perfectly.  The drinks at nice and light but good.  The only thing that could make this place better is outdoor seating.,5,OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 23, 2017"
"We really appreciate that Brezza takes reservations ... a life-saver on a busy Saturday night.  All of our food was very good, but the menu selection was on the small side.  The waiter was competent, but would it kill you to smile and be pleasant?",4,OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 11, 2017"
Our server who we've had before makes the dinning experience rushed and poor. Bringing me a opened straw in bare hands is gross. Clearing the table before we were done. Love brezza not this server.,4,OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 10, 2017"
The food was amazing and the cocktails are a must try.,5,EMJC,"Dined on February 6, 2017"
"This was my second time here and maybe my last. My cocktail was overly sweet (it was a blood orange and tequila base). The pizza took over an hour to make it to our table, meanwhile other tables seated after us got their pizzas before we did. The server cleared our salads and brought clean plates then disappeared for a good thirty minutes. Even after I mentioned that I needed to leave within the next 10-15 minutes could she please bring the check? I had to remind her after 10 minutes passed to bring the check to the table. It was very loud and hard to hear my friend seated next to me.",1,OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 4, 2017"
"Disappointing Italian food for the price. The pizza was just average, the wine was overpriced, and the overall cost of dining probably helps pay the high rent for the ponce location.",3,OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 3, 2017"
It was okay and our waitress was just okay  she didn't seem too happy to get a table of six.,4,OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 28, 2017"
We were the first reservation of the night and they were not ready for us. Once we were seated the service was excellent. Both the food and it's presentation was outstanding.,4,LoSum,Washington DC
"The service for drinks is a bit slow because the wait staff works with the bartenders. Priority should be given to the wait staff over bar patrons at ALL times.  Even though I was greatly annoyed at the time it took to get the drinks, the food and the ambience ensured the evening was going to be nice.  We did not realize it, but the four of us were there for 4 hours talking, eating, and enjoying the very intimate atmosphere offered by the Room.  The three times we have visited the Room, it was not packed....and we are SOOO greatful!  I love this Hot Spot and will return for more quiet and intimate dining experiences.  (Just fix the process of getting drinks!!)  :-)  Tony - Midtown Resident.",5,DLPTony,Atlanta
I live not far away and was looking for a nice place to stop by for wine or a good dinner....this is my choice.,4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"We had a great private room...if we hadn't, the atmosphere would have been less than stellar.  The food was generally fantastic.  We were very disappointed with one particular dish (crab legs had been boiled in an overpowering cinnamon broth); but otherwise we thought it was a great evening.",4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"We have been here several times and we LOVE the wedge salad, lamb plated entree and the pineapple dessert. Also tried the oysters rockefeller and they were delicious!",4,OpenTable Diner,Denver
Was there during the tornado and DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT!  Would love to give a hearty THANK YOU to the server who sent us to the bar for a few extra minutes...we would've been out in the elements otherwise.,4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Best miso soup I've ever tasted. Service was beyond outstanding.,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Service was great and the food was even better than we anticipated.  Organic decor is  very nice - great design.,5,PTCguy,Atlanta
Medium size restaurant in mid-town part of luxury hotel.  Quiet place for a romantic dinner.  Food 3 out of 5.,3,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Great atmosphere - beautiful space.  Food was very good.  Service was ok - restaurant hadn't been open long.  Great place to take a date - except it's pretty noisy (i.e. energetic).,4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Loved it! We went on a Tuesday and had the attention of both a server and SA. It was a night to remember.  Favorite was the cauliflower bathed in cheese - superb!,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
We went during a Festival where three-course dinners were $25 a person and we loved it. The ROOM at Twelve is a the Twelve Hotel and was a wonderful dining experience! The sushi was incredible!,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Simply wonderful.  Great food with stunning presentation.  Service was perfect. Great starters and one of teh best steaks I've ever had...tender, flavor, and cooked perfectly.  Great romantic place for dinner.  Atmosphere intimate yet communal.",4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"I have lunch here at least once a month. The food is always fresh, delicious and on point. The service; however, can be hit or miss...always give myself plenty of time during lunch.",4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
All of the media we read for Thanksgiving indicated a 'buffet'. It was not a buffet and was quite dismayed I had made reservations when my family was looking for something different. As it is on Thanksgiving day we show up and there is no place else to go for what we were looking for. Very misleading.,3,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
They appeared on the open table list for sunday brunch. it was their standard menu. there were a total of 15 people in the restaraunt. it took 30 minutes for scrambled eggs. coffee was old and too strong. very slow service. no validation for $10 valet parking.,2,jodybp,Atlanta
"We elected to go to Sunday Brunch based on other reviews. I don't understand why this place was highly rated. Our table was not ready despite calling ahead to confirm that we were coming but running a few minutes late. Service was friendly but slow and scattered;e.g. served tea and coffee but no spoon; asked for a Mimosa at 12:20 and told they could not serve until 12:30, but the Mimosa never came; had to seek help to get the check, and again to take the check because the wait staff disappeared. And in the end, the Valet could not find where they had parked our car! Honestly, for Sunday Brunch is was more of a ""morning after"" atmosphere. I'd keep looking...",2,OpenTable Diner,New England
"The Room at Twelve is in a nondescript area but the interior is very sleek and modern. The staff is very efficient, well prepared with the menu and specials. The diners varied from family groups with children, couples and lots of well dressed people having lots of fun. The food was well prepared, and the cocktails were good. It was a memorable event.",5,maine,Atlanta
"WOW! I couldn't have asked for a better meal, drinks, and ambience! But the most outstanding aspect of this restaurant was the service. I walked to the restaurant from my hotel on Peachtree St. Knowing the address of ROOM at Twelve was on Peachtree St. I thought it would be simple....just up the street a few blocks. Little did I know that there are at least 12 Peachtree Streets in Atlanta. With 3 employees help, I got there. In fact, one employee actually came out of the restaurant after figuring out where I was and walked to get me! The entire staff was phenomenal! Go try this restaurant for the food and special overall feel!",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
I was please for the meal I ordered....the special tuna tetaki salad. I had requested to have sashimi instead of tetaki but the chef refused to be flexible. While the meal was good I was disappointed that they were unwilling to replace the meat that topped the salad. Overall the service was excellent.,4,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
We liked the ambiance a lot. we ended up eating outside which was comfortable and nicely privatized from the street. The sushi rolls were very good. The filet mignon was a pathetic little end cut entirely without any flavor. cheesecake and chocolate lava cakes were both very good.,3,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"If you are expecting a TWO Urban Licks experience, it is not going to happen at ROOM. The ambiance is dull and it is completely obvious that you are at a restaurant in a hotel lobby. We did dine on a Tuesday night, but the place was dead. Not a soul at the bar and very few tables were occupied. The menu was a one pager with a Hanger Steak as their signature and the other cuts were listed on the bottom of the menu as a after thought. The website refers to ROOM as a 'steakhouse', but it was not apparent from viewing the menu. The calamari and asian beef wrap appetizers were good, and the white tuna entree was to, even after they over cooked the fish. Out waitress was kind and informative, but a little slow.",2,Downey,Atlanta
"Nice hotel/condo restaurant. Uur wiater was friendly and attentive, however there was only one other group there so it wasn't busy. The maitre de was very coridal and approached the table several times asking if we were satisfied or needed anything, which I found refreshing. Food was good, but not exceptional, but I would come back because my overall experience was very pleasant.",4,BobM,Atlanta
"Food was really good--went for Midtown Restaurant Week. The place was surprisingly dead for a Friday night though. There were only a handful of tables occupied, and yet the service still took quite a long time. It started off with the host who wouldn't seat us until she found two menus for us. (Not sure why we couldn't be seated and then given menus?) Then our glasses of wine took about 15 minutes to get. I'm still baffled as to why everything seemed to take so long. The waiter was actually a really nice guy, but the service would be the only reason that would make me think twice about returning. The prices for the regular menu seemed reasonable given the quality. Great choices for its price-fixed menu.",4,Rakesh,Atlanta
"OK, but well short of expectations. Would dine there if invited or happened to be in the area, but would not make a special effort to do so.",3,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"It was alright, service was obnoxious and food was pretty good. Those things coupled with an incredibly slow valet made for a less than awesome night, but it wasn't the end of the world.",3,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Excellent across the board. First time there, but it will not be the last.",5,OpenTable Diner,Las Vegas
"Went to Room for the First time and nothing but a pleasant experience all around. Staff was very attentive. In fact, in my reservations i specially requested a window seat, which was given to another party. However, after requesting to sit on the other side of the room where it was partitioned off, our hostess happily obliged. Our Waitress Landy, was attentive and prompt, and Friendly. The food was excellent. We ordered the calamari, Light crispy pieces with a few scattering of sweet red mini peppers and Tarragon, and lightly sprayed with some sort of sweet/spicy ginger sauce. Lamb was excellent, but perhaps a tad overdone. Sushi rolls were large, filling, and fresh witha unique presentation. I will definitely come back here and recommend.",5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Went on a Saturday night and not many people were there. Ambience was nice but lacking because of the lack of people. Service was ok but not very attentive.,3,Karen,Portland
The filet I ordered had so much peppercorn that you could not taste the beef. The other food was certainly nothing to write home about. The highlight of the meal was the Georgia peach cobbler which was fantastic. The location in a high rise apartment tower was odd.,3,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
Ideal spot for our business lunch. Salads were great. Private dining area for our party was very nice. Beautiful interior decor.,4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Overall, the ambiance was exactly what we were looking for, but the food was very fair.  My husband had a steak. It was cooked to his specifications, and he declared it average - no complaints. I tried the skate wing and would have to recommend they take this off the menu. I am a big seafood fan and was excited to try something new - but a strip of chewy and fried was a disappointment. The calamari was decent, the mashed potatoes and the wine were the highlights.  Our server was good, and the food came quickly.",2,CaryW,Atlanta
"Went to ROOM for Downtown Restaurant Week with my boyfriend and another couple on a Friday night at 9pm. The place was empty and for the life of me, I can't figure out why except maybe lack of advertising? We all ordered off the menu rather than the prix fix and everything was cooked perfectly, looked stunning, and tasted delicious. The wine selection wasn't pretentious or highly selective, but rather suited to wine lovers vs experienced oenophiles in both price and quality. The cost of our entire bill was nominal compared to the quality and quantity of our dinner and drinks. The service was attentive, but not annoying, and typical of what you would expect from a higher end restaurant. However, there were only about a dozen tables.",5,D8nite,Atlanta
Good food and good service. A little pricey compared to other restaurants.,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"The entire evening was off - maitre d changed three times while we were there and did not let the next know that we were in the bar waiting to be called. No one was assigned to our table so a very nice young waiter did ask if anyone had waited on us and seemed to be trying his best but to little effect. There appeared to be no management to coordinate the evening's service. Appetizer came with the meal after quite a lengthy wait and for the price, the entree was not impressive. They will not be there long under these conditions.",1,Queenie,Atlanta
"The food was good but the service left a lot to be desired especially since the restaurant was not full. Disappointing. As well, it did not appear that anyone in particular was in charge.",3,OpenTable Diner,Nashville
Great food! Wonderful place for a business dinner as it is not too loud in the restaurant!,5,OpenTable Diner,Nashville
I went to Room at TWELVE for a birthday celebration with the girls. I had a wonderful time and the service was unmatched! The executive chef even came out to great our table and made a wonderful special treat for my birthday. I highly recommend this restaurant whether it is a romantic dinner date for two or a Girls Night Out!,5,Disappointed,Washington DC
"Food was excellent, I was there for a business meeting (3 hour lunch) and we were taken care of very professionally and effeciently. Erin M. was taking care of us and she was EXCELLENT, I couldn't suggest anything she could do better.",5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Brunch menu good but prefer dinner only because they do not serve sushi during lunch/brunch. Nice place for date night. Environment is inviting and can be cozy. Food is good. You can get parking valeted, if you valet your car.",3,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Great food and service - we will definately be back.,5,ATLDINER,Atlanta
Bad experience the 2nd time around. Waited over 30 minutes at the front to be seated when the restaurant was empty. Waitress was not friendly and service was terrible. Call the manager to complain and she never return my call.,1,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Had a great experience ! The view is great the area is beautiful mostly at night,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
The food was excellent. The pancakes were so fluffy I thought they were going to float off of my plate. This was my first visit. I will now add this location to my rotation of Sunday brunch favorites.,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"This restaurant is NOT on Centenial Park, no matter what the name of the hotel is. Also this restaurant is owned by the same group that owns One Midtown Kitchen and Two Urban Licks - both great restaurants. Room is just another hotel restaurant and there is nothing special about it. Also, ""Brunch"" to ROOM means having pancakes and club sandwiches on the same menu.  Service was awful. It was Mother's Day, and the restaurant was only half full and still couldn't get refills on coffee.",1,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Saturday April 28th,we booked a reservation for five.Coming from a broadway musical at the Fox Theatre and celebrating my parents 50th anniversary,I was especially hopeful for a wonderful dining experience.I was not disappointed in the least.From the filet mignon with bleu cheese crust and roasted potatoes,to the creme brulee desert,everything was ""spot-on"".The service was especially attentive and greatly appreciated. We will definitely return again.Being just a few blocks from the Fox Theatre makes it especially comvenient as the restaurants in the immediate vecinity are often overbooked immediately after a performance.",5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Strange place. Has a cool hip looking vibe, but then actually has a really flat atmosphere, with little to no music playing. The place lacks any kind of mood other than boring.  Additionally, it was some of the worst service I have ever had in a restaurant. . We ended up leaving before ordering and going to eat elsewhere. The cocktails were good though. I would not go back to the place.",2,OpenTable Diner,Birmingham
"hello i actually missed my reservation, but i dined in for a glass of wine on march 08, 2012 and i had a great expierience, i am interested in great hotel prices and would appreciate your feed back for a stay at your hotel at a great price to enjoy your great restaurant at ROOM TWELVE. THANKS FROM STEPHANIE C. WALKER",5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"First time in Atlanta and went to Room at 12. Had a very nice meal and every thing from the appetizer to dessert was very enjoyable and I would return. The calamari was tender and terrific, lamb shank tender and wonderful with the pomegranate seeds. The hanger steak perfectly cooked. Bread pudding and the pomegranate sorbet were spot on.",5,OpenTable Diner,Jacksonville
"Went for Valentine's day and boyfriend hadn't made any reservations, so we kind of ""ended"" up there... It was our first time, the shrimp on my Caesar salad was Delish!! The creamy seafood fondue was pretty tasty. My boyfriend asked for mustard and never got it... Lol. But overall, a good first impression, I may try them out for lunch!",4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Excellent special Valentine's day menu and at a very reasonable price! I've been to all of the Concentrics brand restaurants now and Room is definitely on par with its sister spots. All the courses were presented artfully and were delectable. The service staff were all friendly and happy. The manager even took a picture of my lady and I for us. Dessert was exquisite cuocolate fondue served with a nice glass of champaigne. They even gave her a pretty yellow rose on our way out. We were also pleased that the room service food in the connected Twelve Hotel was prepared at Room, and indulged again in the morning!",5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
As this was my first visit to ROOM I would say...It was perfection!! I returned to my office from lunch I informed many of my colleagues about this fabulous getaway.,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"My husband and I ate the special Valentine's Day tasting menu. We were extremely pleased with the selection and quality of product. However, there was a disparity in the selections: the portions were not similar. The spare rib entree was huge and the tuna was quite sparse for a main dish. Moreover, for $45/person, the dessert seemed like a cop-out. A dish of chocolate with a couple strawberries and some raspberries (albeit there was more on the plate) wasn't satisfying. Overall, though, we will go back and try the rest if the menu. The food was delicious!!! My only real concern was the service. Our waiter was unprofessional and at times, offensive. He made jokes in poor taste.",3,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Gnocchi is awesome. Risotto way too salty.,4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"The atmosphere was nice, the service was some of the best service we have experienced in a while and the food was amazing. We are foodies and don't get impressed much and we were blown away by the food. Top notch. Spot on preparation.",5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"I was initially turned off due to the parking situation at ponce city market. I understand the parking is a third party company and not directly related to the restaurant, but I still expect employees to be able to answer questions customers may have. The machine wasn't working, and there was signs posted throughout the parking lot about ticketing &amp; towing so I was afraid to leave my car without figuring out the parking. On top of that, valet was nowhere in sight, very frustrating!   I also wasn't crazy about the ambience, it just seemed very open and not very exclusive. So far, I wasn't having the best time.   Thankfully, Bryan saved the day. He was so knowledgable about the menu. He recommended the oysters and mussels which were both absolutely amazing. He then recommended the lamb shank for the entree and my God, it was unbelievable! It was seasoned so well, you can tell it was braised all day, the meat fell off the bone! The wine he recommended also paired well with the entree. All in all, Bryan turned my experience around. I will definitely return without a shadow of a doubt!",4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
We picked this spot last minute and it was great. Awesome old building converted to modern time. In an old Sears warehouse with shopping and bars etc. Great way to start an evening in a destination area.,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Best most tender lamb I have ever had.  My wife had the Hanger Steak and said it was very tender and flavorful.  Somewhat noisy but very friendly and knowledgeable staff.  We will be back with friends.,5,BriRob,Atlanta
"We loved our evening at Brezza Cucina. Our waiter Michael was awesome and a big part of why we enjoyed it so much. He made great recommendations. For starters, we had the tuna crudite and wood-roasted oysters. Good choice! For our main entree, we had the roasted chicken and the gnocchi with mushrooms. We also split a side of the flash-fried smashed potatoes. Oh my goodness! They were phenomenal. The roasted chicken was so moist and flavorful! One of the best pieces of chicken I've ever tasted! We'll definitely be back!",5,GeorgiaPeach,Atlanta
"Good food, but kitchen took forever to prepare it. Three chicken salads and the fish shouldn't take 45 minutes to get on the plate. No one in the restaurant was getting timely food that day. Disappointing, to say the least. Too many other options in Atlanta to put up with a kitchen that can't get its act together.",2,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Found reference to Jonathan Waxman's gem in the new Ponce Market in a foodie magazine and thought we'd try it. Although we didn't bring our entire appetite with us, we picked two gems from the menu to share. First was PizzaBrezza, a 12"" sharable appetizer. Absolutely the best pizza we have had in ages!! The sauce was just right and it disappeared fast!! Then, we hit the jackpot - Gnocchi! Oh my, melt in your mouth, browned Gnocchi in a delicious brown sauce, almost too much for two people. And dessert was a dark chocolate mousse with a fruity biscotti.  Only negative, reported by others, is that the restaurant is a bit noisy, largely because of the absence of a sound deadening ceiling (the building is a converted, old commercial space with exposed pipes, etc). Our table, off against the outer wall,  seemed OK. Service staff patient, polite, prompt and professional (the 4 ""p""s of perfection).  A must on your next visit to Atlanta!",5,Insight37421,Charleston
"Both our appetizers were excellent, but our server had great difficulty understanding what we wanted. As we were ordering “bruschetta” he kept saying “prosciutto.” Perhaps because the restaurant is very loud? We thought we had the problem solved when he wrote it down, but sure enough, prosciutto arrived (it looked good). We sent that back and got a very tasty bruschetta, which would have been even better if warm. The oysters were excellent. While both our entrees were good, the main ingredient (rice in the risotto and gnocchi in the gnocchi) added nothing. The rice was watery and gnocchi overly chewy. The other ingredients were great, the gnocchi sauce superb. Since this is a new restaurant, and in general we had a good meal, I'll give them a chance and try it again in a month or so.",3,beltlinebandit,Atlanta
"loved the food: spaghetti Amatriciana was excellent ... the pizza dough was fresh and excellent, as was the tomato sauce on the pizza ... but not making their own burrata - ""brought in for us"" - was a surprising weak spot: why not? - everything else was fresh and delish ... BUT THE PLACE IS WAY TOO LOUD! turn down the noise please! ... otherwise a delightful surprise, recommended by a local we met at Gunshow.",4,Kennedy,San Francisco
"Had dinner here - gnocchi was AMAZING, pizza was FANTASTIC and the  bartenders are great!  Would def return!",4,gababyblues,Atlanta
This was our first visit to PCM and we loved it! Dining at Brezza Cucina was definitely a highlight of the evening. The food was wonderfully presented and tasted even better. We WILL return!,5,fsunolefan1,Atlanta
"We all (4 of us) loved it! Excellent service, food, ambiance. A bit loud, but it seems that almost all restaurants have that ""flaw"".",5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"This new restaurant in Ponce Market is perfectly designed to fit into the Food Hall atmosphere, yet still have its own reserved tables and dining space. It share the same industrial modern look and feel as the entire Food Hall. The open kitchen integrated into the eating space provides a nice energy for the diners.   The food was excellently prepared. The late season tomatoes, the kale salad, and the hogfish crudo were all very  good. The flavors blended perfectly. For main dishes, we sampled swordfish, duck confit, bucatini, and pork. Again, all lived up to the promise presented by what came before.  Service is spotty, particularly when it fill up. Brezza has only been open a short time and this will almost certainly be corrected in the near future.  All in all, a good meal at a reasonable price creatively done.",3,gti37923,Atlanta
Beautiful Ambiance. The best Italian food I've ever had. Great Cocktails. Excellent Dessert,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Context/disclaimer: Restaurant was open one week and Waxman was still in the kitchen overseeing preparation. Location/Space - in newly opened Ponce City Market, industrial space, open kitchen, hard (noisy) surfaces, generously spaced tables. Service - full service (one of few in PCM); our waiter was very good, enthusiastic, knowledgeable about the food and seemed honest in his guidance.  Plates are dropped by runners who ""drop and run"" (e.g. charcuterie was unceremoniously dropped without explanation of various meat offerings). Food - delicious, if not a bit heavy on salt.  Duck confit was highly recommended by waiter and did not disappoint. Came with roasted root veggies and nice sweet/spicy glaze on bottom. Two whole legs was a bit much for volume (and, I love duck confit). Roast chicken was also highly recommended (signature dish) and was also delicious(crispy outside, juicy/tender meat).  Charcuterie was skimpy for the price ($18) - 3 or 4 different meats, sliced paper thin, 4 slices grilled baguette toasts and ramekin of pickled veggies.  I understand that flavor is enjoyed with melt-in-your-mouth-thin slices, but at least offer more than 1 slice per person.  Burrata pizza as appetizer was pleasant but didn't wow the taste buds.  Cocktails - old fashions were quite tasty - spicy cherry aromatics greet you and drink was not-too-sweet.",4,ewATL,Atlanta
"enjoyed a great evening 10/22 for dinner. I had never been over to Ponce City before so I wasn't too sure what to expect crowd wise at 7 but it wasn't too packed. the space is beautiful and they did despite the size they did a great job at making it feel intimate. the food was great. we enjoyed the basil pizza to start and we hadon't the chicken and swordfish for entrees accompanied by the potatoes and braised Greens (thanks to the server recommendation) I had brought wine with me as I was unaware they had just received their liquor license. sort of glad I did as the price of a basic negroni was $14... a few dollars less than I payed for my entree. overall, we had a really great experience. the management and staff were all great and the food was great. I will definitely return.",4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Since they've just opened, the menu was limited, but what we ordered (pizza/gnocchi/olives/tomato salad) was excellent!  Our server, Michael, did a great job and one of the employees from their Nashville restaurant came over to our table three times to make sure we were satisfied.  As of last Saturday, they did not have their liquor license, so we were told on Open Table to bring our own bottle of wine (which we did) and they were happy to accommodate us, without a corkage fee.  This ended up being a very nice and inexpensive dinner.  Looking forward to dining there again.",5,Kimberly,Atlanta
"It has become my new favorite lunch spot. The food is great, the service is quick, and there is free value parking.",5,TCP177,Atlanta
"Got n early, staff was great especially our server and the valet guy, who made us feel welcome. Food was creative, tasty and the Moscato was excellent. These people aim to please and a temperature problem on a steak was handled with professional vigor and sincere concern far superior to your usual hotel fare. This one is a keeper good for business or pleasure.",4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
The menu was limited but the food on the menu was outstanding. I had the shrimp and grits along with a side of breakfast potatoes. My wife had the chicken sandwich and fries. Everything was fantastic. The staff treated us to a dessert to celebrate our anniversary too. I will definitely return.,4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Beautiful restaurant in midtown. Brunch was good. Nice place to dine alfresco,4,francophie,Atlanta
The restaurant is very nice. The food was delicious and the staff was phenomenal. I enjoyed my dinner as did my guests.,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Service was great! The salad, sides and desserts were good but the entree was disappointing!",3,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
The noise from the bar was very intrusive. The restaurant is not suitable for an important business meeting. My guests and I had to yell over the top of the noise coming from the bar.,2,OpenTable Diner,Miami
"Food was good, but portions small.",3,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
The food is outstanding. The location is good and the band playing that night was great.,4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"When we arrived at 5:25pm for our 5:30pm on a Saturday, there was no hostess to greet us. The entire wait staff was eating at the bar and one of them came to seat us. We were given water, but not bread. The $25 3-course meal included items from the regular menu. My beet salad was bland and the beets were from a can. I ordered the room steak and mashed potatoes with vegetables. The meat was tough and the potatoes taste like they came from a box. My string beans were overcooked. With the meal almost over, we were given bread. Another couple came in while we were eating and they were given water and bread as soon as they were seated. I watched them microwave my desert which was tough. At least I didn't pay full price.",1,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
I was disappointed with the creme brulee and the beet salad. The main course I choose was the room steak with mashed potatoes; that was excellent! The server was also great.,3,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
It was ok. The food was good - better than average but the service was really slow. Nice atmosphere but not a place to go if you are really hungry,3,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Excellent food and service. . .we will recommend to friends.,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Good place for lunch meetings. I had a great Waldorf Salad.,4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"This was my first time going to the Room. As a matter of fact, I didn't know that it existed. The food was excellent(roasted chicken in particular). I am definitely going to return.",5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"The roasted beet salad was exceptional, every bite a real treat. The steak was good, not outstanding, and was overcooked for rare. The culcannon was good, but colorless. The wine recommended was not a good pairing for the meal served.  The service was outstanding. That, combined with the beet salad and the generous serving of sorbet for desert, more than made up for the disappointing steak and wine. Overall a very pleasant experience.",4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Pretty quiet for a saturday but Calamari and Seafood Fondue were awesome. Salmon was very good, not spectacular though. The fact that it is in a hotel definitely doesn't add to the experience, doesn't really take away from it either though. Overall a good restaurant that if tweaked a little could be quite popular",4,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
"Went here for Valentine's Day... beautiful ambiance, GREAT food, our server was a little bit slow considering there were very few people dining at that time, but she was very pleasant. Overall is was a great experience and I'm looking forward to dining on their patio in the summer!",5,terryg128,Atlanta
The food was outstanding and thr service was wonderful. This was our first visit and we will definitely be back.,4,mad4usc,Atlanta
This visit to Room was not the best. I was happy to see the restaurant was packed but our table was not ready when we arrived. We had to wait around 15 minutes for our table which was disappointing considering I had made a reservation and arrived right on time. The service was INCREDIBLY SLOW. I know Room has had slow service in the past - usually the food/drink is so good it makes up for it but this time the bread was hard/stale and I was very disappointed that the only light beer option was Miller Light (why no Amstel Light/Heineken Light?).,2,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Very nice place. We stayed in the hotel so the convenience was key but the food was very very good and our server was awesome.,4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"My girlfriend and I came here Saturday, February 12 for an early Valentine's Day dinner and this was the first time coming to this restaurant. I enjoyed the design, decor, service and most importantly the food. The best thing was that my girlfriend enjoyed it too which was a good thing. I had the stuffed chicken breast with brussel sprouts, pumpkin, carrots and chicken au jus and my girlfriend had the seafood fondue. Half-way into our meal we enchanged dishes just to taste and I was very pleased with both dishes and so was she. I would definitely recommend this place to my family and friends.",5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Looooooved it. Will definitely return.,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Small but feels bigger because of the large windows &amp; high ceilings. Very modern decor. Excellent service &amp; will go back when it's warm enough to sit on the patio. Everyone enjoyed meals. The cream of cauliflower soup was wonderful, very smooth &amp; creamy, had more flavor than I expected &amp; the dates were a surprising &amp; delicious touch. The staff was courteous &amp; friendly &amp; our server was excellent. Appreciated the validated valet parking.",4,Nubian1,Atlanta
Food and service were excellent. My wife and I were very pleased with this restaurant.,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"The Restaurant Group promoted this restaurant as a great NYE dinner location. It was so disappointing and BORING!! The sushi was, messy with no flavor. The overall atmosphere was so lackluster.",3,OpenTable Diner,Charleston
"great menu, nice ambience, great service. Food took a little long to come out. Ahi tuna appetizer - fantastic and nice presentation. My $26 a la carte filet was overcooked. :( I asked for a complimentry dessert which was outstanding - choco lava cake with toasted marshmallow.",3,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Nothing special, didn't have a drink menu. Sushi was good but ambiance was nothing great, felt like a hotel lobby restaurant.",2,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Pretty good for a hotel bar/restaurant,2,Christmas,Atlanta
Great!! All expectations were met!!,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"For the price of the Christmas buffet, we have enjoyed the selection and atmosphere at 57th Fighter Group and Ray's on the river much more in the past. This was worth a try - just not worth the price.",3,PinkiesDiva,Atlanta
"My husband and I had brunch on Christmas 2010. Our server was attentive and pleasant. However the food was quite bland and the sweet potatoes were a great disappointment. The desserts were unappealling and it appears there was definitely a short supply of sugar in the kitchen. The salad and shrimps were the most enjoyable part of the meal. This is not the place to go for a holiday meal. Absolutely too expensive for such a ""blah"" meal.",2,TreatyourPalateWell,Atlanta
"Made nearly-last-minute Christmas dinner reservations here and am so glad I did! Buffets aren't usually very good, but this one was pretty darn delicious, esp. appetizers. Excellent service, wine list, comfort and ambience. Kids' items were just plain ikky, though...hamburgers and the like had been sitting around too long. (But there were other kid-friendly foods available).",4,AlisonJ,Atlanta
The service was amazing and the food was some of the best that myself and my date has ever had. The sushi is to die for and the kalamari was the best!,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Classy atmosphere, delicious food, great service. Now my favorite place to take a client. food, classy and",4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Food was great, and the service was wonderful.",4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
The service was amazing and the steaks were phenomenal.,4,OpenTable Diner,Charleston
"We were in town for a conference and this was highly recommended. The decor is outstanding. The food was great--yummy salads, good selection of wines, nice presentation of entrees. The only drawback was that there was only one other couple in the whole restaurant on Sunday evening (the ones who had recommended it). Apart from it being Halloween, I thought it was spooky. I hope they have a good business.",4,KatieD,Philadelphia
"The service staff was very accommodating. We were able to be seated even though the rest of our party was not there and when they arrived, seating them was no problem. We ordered in courses--which some restuarants frown upon--and each course was delicious. We spent over four hours eating and talking.",4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Greasy, poor service (didn't remember most items requested), slow service, very little taste (other than grease).",1,TwinsGrandma,Atlanta
"We arrived for our reservation to discover we were the only people in the restaurant. The waiter seated us and then took 15 minutes to bring us our drinks. We were the ONLY people there at this point. Orders were mixed up and just plain wrong. One person ordered a hamburger medium well and it arrived so over cooked it was practically a hockey puck. She sent it back and the new burger arrived medium rare. The food was mediocre, at best. We had to flag our non existent server down to order wine to go with our dinner because he ran off without asking us. Then the check arrived. It took almost 25 minutes to get the check sorted &amp; paid. RIDICULOUS considering we were some of their ONLY diners. This was a terrible experience. We won't be back.",2,Atlanta,Atlanta
"My friends and I went to Room for my birthday. We are from Birmingham and wanted to dine at a restaurant that isn’t in Birmingham. Service and food was wonderful, this is a nice place for date night.",3,OpenTable Diner,Birmingham
"Terrific, diverse menu. Attentive and professional servers. The manager, Dawn, made our birthday dinner a special occasion.",5,JimmyE,Atlanta
Food was good but not outstanding. Brought out to the table lukewarm which was disappointing.,3,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"So glad we paid attention to the reviews! On a night when so many other places were booked up, we were able to get into ROOM. Everything was fantastic.",5,HappyDiners,Dallas
Sometimes you go to a restaurant once and you are impressed. Return visits are good indicators of the quality of food and service at a good dining spot. Two visits to Room at Twelve within one week and our second meal was as excellent as the first time we dined there. I had to order the Hearty Salad again on the second visit and it was as delicious as the first time. One diner commented that the filet melted in his mouth and another diner was very impressed with the lamb shank. Calamari appetizer was delicious and as much fun and interesting as our first meal here. Don't forget to have blackberry cobbler if it is on the menu.,5,OpenTable Diner,Naples
Very enjoyable and convenient. I went back a second time during my 7 day stay and took our company group. We all enjoyed.,5,JIm4,Nashville
"Nice meal, service and spot to eat in Atlanta.",4,Familyskitrip,Cincinnati
"Great find, didn't know this place existed. Food and service was wonderful. Cinnamon ice cream with bread pudding for dessert is outstanding!! Best ice cream ever, and I don't really like ice cream.",5,OpenTable Diner,Las Vegas
"The food was fresh &amp; delicious. Seared trout over creamy corn is a light, beautifully seasoned dish with a wonderful scent of celery leaves. Soup of the day was a flavorful, creamy tomato-basil bisque. Wait-staff in a hotel restaurant should be used to serving solo females. However, I was nearly ignored. Upon arrival, there was no one at the host station. Eventually, the hostess arrived &amp; started to seat the people behind me before waiting on me. I had to remind her that I was first. The server who took my order returned only to collect money at the end of the meal. Others served my meal, picked up the dishes &amp; brought the check. No one asked about my food or if I wanted dessert or coffee. I would have praised the food had anyone asked.",3,Patrice,Atlanta
"Room at Twelve: What a little gem! Our main question is with food so good, why wasn't this place packed? We ate salads, soup, appetizers throughout our meal and each plate surpassed expecations and totally satified our taste buds and our tummies. The three little pigs was an artery buster, but why not? This was mac and cheese with a twist and we are eating at Room again in just a few nights so this will be on our table. Have you ever heard of pickled blackerberries? They were on the hearty salad, plentiful and they redeemed the $10.00 price for a small, well presented salad. We love Room at Twelve, but then again we love the sister restaurants, One Midtown Kitchen and Two Urban Licks.",5,OpenTable Diner,Naples
We had a group of six and everyone raved about the food. The Mac and Cheeese should be an entree not a side. The White Snapper was over the top good. The have a corkage fee so we were able to take our own wines to enjoy with dinner. I would highly recommend ROOM.,4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Not really fair to review a restaurant on a holiday.  buffet rather than their typical fare.,2,MichaelR,Atlanta
"Read some poor reviews of the Room @ Twelve regarding rude and slow service, but basically good food. Since it was a slow weekend in Atlanta the week before Xmas, we thought we would give it a shot. We ordered the flash fried calamari (fantastic), wedges with blue cheese, bacon, and jalepenos (great), the room burger and cream spinach (awesome) and the special that night, filet + asparagus and shrimp tempura roll. My girlfriend wanted a strip instead of the filet and they accomodated with a slight upcharge (steak was cooked perfectly to a medium rare on the rare side).  As to the service, it was fantastic and included 2 visits from the manager to check on us....well spread out and not overbearing at all.  All in all, a 8/10 at least.",4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
The food was wonderful and the the atmosphere was perfect! I would recommend this for anyone!,4,Elaine,New England
Everything was great. Server was just blah and borderline rude. I've eaten at room and all other concentrics restaurants and I've never had such mediocre service.,4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"As always, the food is amazing but the service is VERY slow. Make sure you book your reservation early since there is typically a long wait for the food.",4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Business lunch. Quick attentive service. Great food.,4,jamlikomari,Atlanta
"We chose this restaurant based on recent open table reviews only, as we were not familiar with the area. Upon entering we were shocked that the dining room was completely empty aside from a few patrons at the bar. My husband and I were somewhat skeptical at first but decided to stay since we were already there. Our server Brian was very nice and offered great suggestions from what I consider a very limited menu. We had the calamari, which was excellent! I ordered the Room Burger and my husband ordered the herb chicken and mashed potatoes. We ended up switching entrees but they were both well prepared. For dessert we shared the apple purse with cinnamon ice cream. It was amazing. Our server had to bring us an extra scoop of ice cream!",4,ParkJones,Charleston
"I went to Room @ Twelve on Saturday evening with a large group. The restaurant has excellent ambiance, however maybe because we were seated close to their open kitchen, I found it to be warm. For appetizer I had calamari, which was excellent. I ordered the ROOM Steak,which was just okay. Dessert was my favorite.Service was excellent, would recommend, cool spot to dine. Hope this was helful.",4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
The mac n' cheese is to die for!!!!,4,OpenTable Diner,Tallahassee
"Lots of reviews for bad service. We had outstanding service last night. A little slow on the dessert but that is because they were making it fresh, can't complain about that.",3,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
This place was jam packed and considering how busy they were everything was delightful!,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"The service was absolutely horrible. It took about 10 minutes to be seated despite there being more than 80% of the tables open and even when we sat down a server did not come to our table until 20 minutes later. The worst part was that they give bread baskets to every table but our table did not receive one until we asked...TWICE! Do not recommend going here if you are looking for exceptional service, but the food was good.",2,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
i was a little disappointed that the menu had limited offerings. Location is good; service was great. This would not be on the top of my list of restaurants to dine at again.,3,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Service was a little slow for a lunch crowd. This would not be a very good place to go for lunch if you are pressed for time, but again, the staff could have been off their game on today.",3,Fun2dine,Atlanta
Food was very forgetable; not many other patrons considering it was a Friday night.,2,DeanD,Atlanta
"Way too noisy for a business lunch. Service spotty and slightly inattentive. On the positive side, the restaurant validates valet parking which convenient.",3,Cosmo,Charlotte
"I was not sure what to expect when I went to the restaurant, but since I frequent other Concentrics restaurants (ONE, Two, Murphy's), I knew the food should be great. The meal was perfect, and the service was superb. When the server accidently knocked over a glass of wine, several people quickly cleaned it up, made sure we were fine, and asked to replace it and offered desserts. We politely declined, but she gave us the ""Swagger"" promotion anyway when the bill came. It was a nice touch by a very nice server (Elizabeth).  ROOM was quiet, but being in a hotel, I can imagine a convention or big dinner being easily handled with superb food. Concentrics restaurants can make great meals, and that is a perfect way to start a meal.",5,RESIII,Atlanta
"We have been to this restaurant several times, primarily because it is convenient to where we live, seldom crowded and good food. On this trip however my wife ordered the Room Steak, well done. The steak was tough and we mentioned this to the manager. The manager told us that the steak is always best served medium because of the density of the cut. It would have been nice if the server had told us this before she ordered. Also, eventhough the restaurant was empty our server seem to rush us through our meal. Will give the room one more try but won't recommend at this point.",2,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Amazing rolls! 12 roll was very very tasty!,4,OpenTable Diner,Charleston
"This places seems to get negative reviews for service, but we received unbeatable service. Our waitress (also the hostess) was Beverly, and she took great care of us. Granted, it was not too hard to keep tabs on us, given that we were the only ones in the dining room (on a Friday night at 8) for most of our meal. There was a band playing, but still hardly any crowd. So don't come here to be seen. But the food was pretty good, and the service was definitely satisfying.",3,OpenTable Diner,Washington DC
Restaurant week- portions were extremely small! We are a super club and have participated in restaurant week for several years and the portions have never been that skimpy.,4,PamelaJ,Atlanta
"I went here with a friend for Restaurant Week. The best part about the restaurant was the live music and friendly staff. There were plenty of people mingling at the bar and it seemed to be a mature crowd. The food was ok. I could have made better salmon at home, but the salad and sushi were good. My friend ordered the steak and liked it although the portion was small. The chocolate cake tasted like it was made a week ago:( I may go here again to enjoy the music and order some sushi or different menu item.",3,Kira,Atlanta
"The wine was the most memorable thing about ROOM. It was a little pricey and there really weren't many people there. The bar looked crowded and the was a woman singingo so that was fun. Otherwise, I probably won't go out of my way to go here again.",3,GTDonna02,Atlanta
Held a business lunch meeting for 6 at Room at Twelve. Atmosphere was great for conversation - quiet and the service was professional and unintrusive. Thoroughly enjoyed the food.,4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"The presentation and taste of the food were very good. Our beverages were continuously being filled in a very timely manner. The waiter was delightful, also- very informative and attentive.",3,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Room had great food. We went for Restaurant Week and had the steak. Really great potatoes. The Best part was probably the appetizer. It was a minced tuna roll. Excellent.,4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Perhaps I am spoiled having lived in NYC, but this place did not wow me. The server was very friendly and helpful, and my girlfriend especially liked her. And the food was good, but nothing spectacular. Overall, I would say that the restaurant was good. However, having plenty of amazing restaurants in my list of possibilities to recommend to others, I would probably not recommend this particular restaurant.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Great downtown lunch spot! I've made another reservation to dine again this week:). Need I say more!,4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Excellent food. Service was very good and not rushed. If you're in a hurry you'll want to let your server know, otherwise they leave you to enjoy very good food. Extensive wine list at all price ranges, full bar and excellent varied menu.",4,Qmaximus,Atlanta
"The food and service were very good. I did think that the pricing was on the high side. As ide from that, I would not hesitate to recommend ROOM at Twelve to diners.",4,OpenTable Diner,Philadelphia
"This was an excellent choice for my Valentine and I. The service was outstanding, the food was great and the presentation of the food was beautiful.  The only negative was the noise level, I was not expecting it to be that loud. This was my first visit to Room but, I will definitely visit again for the awesome sushi.",4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"My girlfriend and I went to Room on Valentines day. We were promptley sat at our reservation time. The atmosphere was nice and romantic. Our server (whom I don't remember the name) didn't greet us for 5 or 6 minutes. We ordered a bottle of wine (the server was no help in picking it out, so we just kinda winged it) they were out of the first bottle we ordered, but the server didn't come back and tell us they were even looking for one until about 5 min later. She then proceded to struggle with opening the bottle while taking our order (my girlfriend asked if she needed help). Food was excellent though my ribey was a little over cooked, but nothing to complain about. Other than the server, everything was great! I would definatly come back.",3,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"The food was very good, but the attention from our server was minimal and slow. Had to wait for a spoon for quiet a while after the soup arrived at our table.",3,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"It was a pleasant experience, the staff was quite friendly and helpful.",3,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"My wife and I went to Room at Twelve for Valentines Day. The first thing you notice is the design. The restaurant was very sleak and contemporary, a little dark though. The waiter was nice, but not very knowledgeable. He had to keep looking at his notes for the specials. We started with the soup of the day which was a tomato bisque with goat cheese and pesto oil. It was a very nice well balanced soup. That was pretty much where it went downhill. I ordered the short rib, however it was more like a pasta dish with bits of short rib in it. My wife had a par level filet and the food was pretty much a flop. The mac and cheese was good, if you want to get a double bypass after dinner.  Overall grade: C-",3,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
We went for Valentine's Day.  It was wonderful and feastive.  The food and service were great!,4,Dren,London
"I guess it was to loud and the tables were to close for any kind of romantic setting, which is what my husband and i were going for. the next table was like 2 feet on each side and i could hear everything they were saying. the food was excellent. i just wont go back. plus they advertised rose for each valentines customer. prices were alittle steep and not a big selection on the menu.",2,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Food was great, service was great. All around a great experience! Will definitely come back.",4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
My date and I enjoyed the ambience. We wanted a romantic Valentine's night out and thats what we got. The food was wonderful. I had spare ribs and she had chicken. There were a variety of great wines on their to choose from. We were quite pleased,4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Our dining experience was great! Our food was incredible, and we felt like we could have a conversation easily. Our waitor was wonderful as well!!",5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"The menu is weighted toward Asian fare but also has steak, chicken and pasta. Overall the food was very good. Here are some major nits though. First, they served the Sake in a champagne glass and a wine sniffer. Yes, i said a champagne glass. The Sakes as good but not the way it is supposed to be enjoyed or kept at the temperature you ordered (hot or cold). The beer battered mushroom caps could have been good but the batter was very dark since it appeared they had not changed the fry oil in a while. My trout with gnocchi and asparagus vas very good. Also, the wine by the glass selection is excellent and reasonably priced. The ambience is very nice also - hip. I would go back though.",3,Hcveramia,Miami
"There weren't many people working that afternoon, one chef and two servers. When we go there, we were standing at the front for 10 minutes waiting for someone to seat us. After being seated, we were treated fairly well. When the food came, we were given another table's order, and then once we had the right food, the food was barely even luke warm. All in all, it was an alright experience. Pretty bad for such a high class looking place, but okay for my standards. Could've done better. Not sure if I'll eat there again.",2,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Second time and now tried more than just the sushi - excellant preparation and taste - service superb,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Sadly, the quality has declined over the years. The seafood chowder is 3 chunks of meat that they claim Mahi Mahi but tastes like beef.  If you want just a nice environment, ROOM at 12 will do. But if you want quality food, service, and environment; walk over to BLT Atlanta at W hotel nearby.",2,Alban,Atlanta
The waitstaff was very nice. They actually knew what the food tasted like and were able to give good recommendations from the menu. I would definitely go there again.,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"we were not really impressed with Room at Twelve - as we have dined at other restaurants owned by the same group (one midtown and two urban licks) and have had very good dinners and experiences. Our waiter was not on top of things...the bottle of wine we ordered was not available, a second choice also not available and finally a third suggestion was made . our appetizers arrived prior to our wine. all of that could have been handled differently and better. the meal was good, not outstanding, but the pace of the ordering and drink deleivery really changed the feeling of our dining experience.",2,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Neat hotel lobby restaurant.  It was very cold, though.  Space heaters sitting around did little to remedy this situation.  Impressive slab of beef was cooked perfectly.  Great sides, salad.  Pre-dinner beverage pleasantly stiff.  Way dark in the place, but maybe there was an electricity and heat shortage that day!  Tasty experience all in all.  I just wish I wasn't chilly throughout.",4,AppalachianWino,Atlanta
"Dinner at the Room at Twelve on New Year's Eve was great! Our waiter, Derrick, was fantastic. Coincidentally, we saw him the next day in Atlantic Station and not only did he remember us, but what we ordered. The manager was very friendly and personable. Most importantly, the dinner was delicious. The marinated chicken breast and charbroiled filet were perfectly seasoned to our taste. The 3 little pigs mac-n-cheese is my favorite side dish. Great atmosphere and great staff!",5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Food was outstanding. Staff was gracious but not very professional. Atmosphere was relaxed. Will likely return.,4,OpenTable Diner,Greensboro
"Great place, but the food was bland. If the restaurant can add more flavor to the food then it will be 5 stars across the board.",4,OpenTable Diner,Washington DC
My only issue is that gratuity is was placed on the check. I have been to this restaurant before and that did not happen. The practice is insulting to me.,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Not as good as other Concentric restaurants. Food was ok / a little disappointing. The poor service two times in a row is why I don't plan on going back.,2,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Sushi was... ok... too much rice for me. Service was great and the atmosphere energetic! Would go again... Great spot for groups and couples.,3,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Food, Service, and Ambiance are all awesome!!!!",5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"We had our annual company Christmas party there Saturday night and it was great. The service and food could not have been any better. No matter what you have a taste for, from steak to chicken to fish, there is something on the menu for everyone. One of our guest said their steak was simply the best he had ever had! ( He had the Filet Mignon Oscar)",5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Great food, great atmosphere, but the service was a little slow. I could understand if they were busy, but we were one of two tables in the entire restaurant (this was during the SEC championship game, so Atlanta was a ghost town) and the only table our waitress had. The food, though, was worth the wait. I had the braised pork with chard and polenta, my husband the Room Steak with blue cheese fries. Everything was wonderful, and I loved the feel of the place.",4,AmyH,Jacksonville
"After I ordered, a 2nd waiter showed up to ""take my order"", then claimed he was ""part of the team"" along with original server, just let either of us know what you need. Rather confusing, especially since then neither of them seemed much available -- waiting ""forever"" seemed the norm, whether for pepper for my entree (it was half-gone before I got my pepper), or for the bill. Appetizer came before drink -- I had to ask again for the drink, again the waitstaff ""team"". Trout was nice, but had to wait forever to just get some black pepper. Nobody knew about the Southern Hospitality discount card I presented. C'mon, if you are going to join an incentive program, alert your staff! Felt a lot of ""attitude"" from wait staff for no reason.",2,JimC,Portland
"One of the best Filets in Atlanta; hidden gem. As good as Chops or Bones; limited choices however - just Filet, and Cowboy Cut 22oz Ribeye. Great spot before GaTech events - park and walk to Bobby Dodd.",5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Went to Room for Thanksgiving. They didn't note on their website it was going to be a pre-fix buffet menu for the evening. While the food was usual buffet fair with some interesting additions, the service was slow. Our drink order took 20 minutes to arrive. All our waiter had to do was deliver the wine to the table and replace our plates for any return trips to the buffet.  Also, I was surprised that they added an automatic 18% gratuity to the check for a party of 3 people. As mentioned, this was a pre-fix buffet. Generally a buffet warrants only a 10% tip which actually fit better for the service we received.  Overall, while not a bad dinner, I'm not inclined to return to try their regular menu nor for another holiday meal.",2,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"My friend and I ate at Room at Twelve during Midtown Dine Week. The $25 menu was fantastic! Our waitress was very attentive without being annoying. We had the chicken croquetts &amp; beer battered mushrooms to start. Both were delicious and quite filling. For the entrees, we had the Pan seared tuna and Braised pork sholder. The meals were great portion sizes and absolutely excellent.",4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
bone in rib eye very good cut and cooked/seasoned well - trout not impressive - mac and cheese very good,3,RK87,Atlanta
"Went there for lunch and it was nearly empty. That's why I don't understand why we were basically ignored by the wait staff. The food however (a smoked salmon BLT, I think), was extremely good.",3,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Service was mixed; it took forever to be seated and served our cocktails but after that our server was attentive, if a little unenthusiastic. The food was of good quality, from an interesting menu, but the execution was a little off. My salad was over salted and my guest's steak was significantly off his requested temperature. In contrast, my salmon was perfectly cooked. The noise level and dining room layout make this a poor choice for a business dinner. Overall, good but significantly short of what it could be. Not for foodies.",3,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"ROOM was excellent for a special night out. It was very quiet when we were there around 6:30. We ended up coming back for drink after a show later that evening. It was definitely a bit more noisy later at night. The food was superb and priced on par with its quality. Also, be sure to try one of the cocktails.",5,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
Good food - we all liked what we ordered. Restaurant was too cold.,3,FoodPros,Atlanta
"I have only eaten here for lunch. The food and menu selection are both very good. The orders took longer than I would have liked considering that the restaurant was only moderately busy. However, everyone at our table for four was served at one time. The food was hot and freshly prepared. We arrived exactly at 12:00 noon, so the kitchen may have been backed up a bit.",4,OpenTable Diner,Orlando
Food was amazing - the Chef just outdoes himself! There is not a better place in the city for lunch!,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
enjoyed the meals and were filling.,4,OpenTable Diner,Miami
Waiter was a bit inexperienced on how to handle bottles of wine,3,OpenTable Diner,Indiana
"I would return to this restaurant in a heart beat if I'am ever in Atlanta again. The service was perfect, and the food was a very good value.",4,OpenTable Diner,Las Vegas
I loved the look of the restaurant and overall the ambiance is very good. I had the fish and chips and must say the beer batter was tasty but the fish had no taste. Our server was on point and my experience was a good one.,4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Very interesting space and fantastic service from our waiter highlights solid, enjoyable food. Thanks!",5,OpenTable Diner,Sacramento
"WOW! Very nice restaurant, great food, great waitress!! What a nice surprise to stumble on this place. Very quiet on Sunday afternoons and Great brunch!",4,Bruncher,Philadelphia
Owners need to decide if it's going to be a fining dining restaurant or a bar...place in not set up for both...too noisy to enjoy food and quite conversation with a birthday bash with music going on in the bar...,1,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Great Service! Great beverages! Great food!!!! Great place to chill or to be up-beat with friends!,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Very romantic dining experience. There was also a really nice view from the restaurant. The food was really tasty expecially the chicken. I would love to dine here again.,5,jjonesrad007,Atlanta
"The staff was attentive and friendly. The food was average, nothing special. I ordered the steak with mash potatoes. The potatoes were cold. Our server James immediately brought out hot potatoes. The drinks were superb!!!! It was my birthday and they ran out of Happy Birthday plates so, I was given a Happy Anniversary plate instead, it was hilarious, plus anniversary was spelled wrong. The only down side to the evening was the valet. He was extremely rude and insulting. He called me old and thought that my friend was my daughter. To top the night off, the valet didn't even bring out the right car. I would dine again to taste other items on the menu and I enjoyed the overall atmosphere. I will just park my own car.",3,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"My first time there! Loved the ultra modern look. Bartender made a wonderful Lemon Drop Martini, the service was good and the food was plentiful. Will definitely come back!",4,Joan,Atlanta
"Breakfast was quite tasty, however pricey. Glad we made use of their ""Summer Swag"" promo of 50% off. Quiet on a Sunday morning which was nice with the kids. Our waiter was the only person serving, and he was also the host which made service quite slow.",3,luv2eat,Atlanta
"My friends and I went out for my birthday and I chose this place because of the head chef's reputation. The food was excellent; however, the service was a little slow. It appears the restaurant was one or two servers short and it took a long time in between courses. Our server was polite and attentive throughout the evening. A specialty drink on the menu called the violet hour tasted wonderful! I will go back on a less crowded evening.",3,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"The waitress was very nice and attentive, without being intrusive. The food was bland at best. I had battered mushrooms for the appetizer; they were canned mushrooms, unseasoned and fried in an unseasoned batter. The horse radish sauce was passable. My wife had a Caesar salad; the dressing tasted mostly of mayo, which is not normally in a Caesar dressing. Her ""well done"" steak was crispy to burned around the edges, and pretty red inside. The vegatables included obviously frozen, very bright green broccoli. Not too bad, but we didn't expect frozen. I had trout that was okay, but the texture wasn't great; a little gooey. we definately won't go back.",2,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"The food was not that great. I used the Restaurant Week as an opportunity to try Room. I probably will not go back. The food was just not tasty. The service was very good, though.",3,OpenTable Diner,Baltimore
Super cocktail at the bar -- The Violet Hour was the name of the delicious concoction,4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"This was a extremely extraordinary restaurant! Service impeccable, and the quality of service second to none. Highly recommend!",5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
I always enjoy my dining experience at Room. The food is delicious and the service is attentive.,4,ERATL,Indiana
"We have been Room Groupies for several years, we even brought in New Year's there in '08. The chef we adored moved to a different restaurant and alot of the things we loved changed.  The old chef used innovative seasonings and twists to combat the 'typical', but now the tastes are kind of typical.  No need to pay those prices when I'm not going to get an oral explosion of wonderment.",3,DLPTony,Atlanta
"Walked arrived early and sat down at the mostly empty bar to enjoy a cocktail. My girlfriend ordered a pina colada which they couldn't make but found some coconut rum to make an alternative.  At dinner we started with the crabcakes - lots of crab meat and not much ""filler"" - yum! When entrees came we were disappointed that despite the relatively empty dining room our orders (mine the pork chop and hers the grilled salmon) came out overcooked. In fact she sent hers back; I was being more tolerant but probably should have as well. The waitress, while not rude, was not terribly gracious about it either. Upon finishing our meals we were presented the check without being asked about dessert. We were lucky to have a $25 off coupon.",2,LondonintheATL,Atlanta
"Not the best experience. One guest did not receive what he ordered, but was charged for the higher priced food that he did receive. Very loud. 8 people at one long table is ineffective for conversations - not the best choice.",2,TwinsGrandma,Atlanta
Crab Cakes and Sushi was exceptional. We will be back.,4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Excellent. Very good atmosphere. Delicious food. Great service. Perfect for a romantic date.,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Very quiet for a Friday night. Great 50% off deal on wine bottles of $72 or more.,4,WilliamFromAtlanta,Atlanta
"A great dining experience. I took my father who is pretty picky about his food and expects much from the wait staff - needless to say, he was very impressed.",4,ERATL,Indiana
We had a great experience. Food was amazing. Wakeelah (the server) was friendly and attentive. The food Yummy. The manager even stopped by to make sure we had a good experience. If you aren't having lunch here you are missing out!!!,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Room is one of my favorite restaurants! The food is always excellent and the service during my last visit was on point! Thanks Room - I will be back!,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
My party of 5 had lunch at Room on 5/16 in honor of my mother's 70th birthday. We were very pleased w/ both our service (Hamita was her name) and the quality of the food. Will definitely come back again.,4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
The sushi left much to be desired. It seems as if the quality is inconsistent because I was told that it was better just the week before. The miso soup was different and a welcome surprise.,2,Valerie,New York Area
"Had a very nice time celebrating my girlfriends 21st birthday at Room at Twelve. since her and her friends are new to the restaurant scene they were a bit Timid but the waiter very helpful to her friends, he even waived off a drink that my girlfriend didn't enjoy. the Food was good but i was a bit dissapointed with the portions. but still it was a very good steak. i will certainly return next time I am in Atlanta.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"LOVED the atmosphere with the clean lines and cool lighting. Food was excellent, and they accommodated splitting dishes for my children to share. Service was superb!",5,OpenTable Diner,Greensboro
"WOW - really cool place. And the food was excellent. Loved the sushi appetizers and the specials. We were there on a Friday night and the place was practically empty, though. Too bad. The ambiance and food are really worth it - you could do a romantic night, business dinner, or fun group event at this place. The only stutter was the service; wait staff is extremely friendly, just uneven on the service. Bringing dishes out in a timed manner, removing dishes, pouring wine, etc. But not so bad to not go to this place. I highly recommend!",4,mamamelis,San Francisco
"Yum, Yum, Yum. The waldorf salad is to die for. Everyone in our group enjoyed their meal.",4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"An decadent, well-executed menu and vibrant scene make ROOM worth a visit. There may still be some kinks that need working out (eg, friendly but forgetful service), but overall, a solid choice. Go on a weeknight when it's less crowded, and be sure to try the blue cheese fries.",3,mtf419,Portland
"Their trout and steak were delicious. They have an interesting cocktail menu involving bacon infused bourbon and a carrot cake flavored cocktail. The service was very attentive. The ambience was not really romantic, the dining area was too open to be categorized as romantic; however, it could be a cool place for friends and groups to hook up. The price range was very affordable.",4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Food was great. Service was good as well.,4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"The food was simply spectacular!!! But before I get to that, the ambiance was very pleasent, not to mention the smooth jazz and Eniga mix they had playing set the mood just right. My date and I had a great time, the service was simply unbelievable. I had to move my reservation to an earlier time, and had no issues what so ever. They delievered the flowers I ordered at the exact moment I planned. The sushi and steak, that I had were utterly dilectable, and not to mention the dessert was just as good. Hands down, Room at 12 is one of the best spots in Atlanta.",5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Met clients from out of town and everyone seemed to be impressed.,4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"The only issue I had during this dining experience was the Valet services, which I thought was unprofessional and unfriendly.",3,OpenTable Diner,Washington DC
"Very quiet, romantic, great date spot! Food was wonderful, nice portions as well.",5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
GREAT Food and service.,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
I love coming to Room. I go every year for my birthday and every year the food and staff are awesome. I love the salmon sushi and it's the only place to get Fifth Leg wine in the city of Atlanta. I can't wait to go back.,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
I had a VIP staying at the hotel so this was the easiest for dinner. We were all pleasently surprised by the quality of the food. I'll be back (even w/o the expense account).,4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Went for brunch, the food was awesome and portions were large! We were there pretty early on Saturday so there was only one other diner in the restaurant with us. Service was very quick.",3,OpenTable Diner,Washington DC
"We enjoyed the entire evening. The atmosphere was modern and up-to-date, all the food items were delicious, and the service was excellent. Our waitress was unobtrusive, but very attentive. Would recommend it to someone seeking a new and different experience.",4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Lunch was delicious (""wow"" to the tortilla soup, rosemary lemonade, and the seared ahi), and - as always - service was friendly and fantastic. ROOM is a great meal and experience.",5,Foodienatl,Atlanta
Fabulous! Went to ROOM with a girl friend during concentrics' restaurant week. 3 course meal for $25 was DEFINITELY a steal. The chicken croquettes and grilled salmon were delicious and the dessert was to DIE FOR - peach upside down cake a la mode. I would go back JUST for the dessert - it was THAT good.,5,kciaobaby,Atlanta
"Went for dinner during restaurant week. The service starting from the host, who picked us up from the valet, the bus boy, who waited for both my girlfriend I to finish before he started taking away, to our server who was attentive yet not bothering or rushing us,'was AMAZING. The ambience was great and the contemporary decor looked very nice. The shrimp-crab sliders and tomato bisque were outstanding. Unfortunately both our entrees lacked some life, we had the salmon and he steak. The White chocolate creme brule was really good as well. All in all I would definitely recommend the Room to others.",5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"An average restaurant experience. There were some cons but the pros outweighed them. Ambiance: Compared to Lobby at Twelve it feels a lot less like an actual restaurant &amp; there weren't many people there that evening so it was a much different ambiance than Lobby. Food: My steak dish w/ blue cheese fries was extraordinary (the steak was cooked perfectly)but I would recommend removing the crab/shrimp sliders from the menu (thought it would be a shrimp/crab cake but it was more like shrimp/crab slaw). Service: everyone was nice &amp; extra helpful (felt like we had 3 different servers) but the food came out pretty slowly (confusing bc so few ppl there) &amp; it took a while to get the check. Despite minor flaws, I'd recommend giving it a try.",3,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"We had a party of 8 and were seated in a semi-private room, which was very nice. The food was fabulous - a little slow in coming, but our server was wonderful. I would definitely recommend this restaurant and will visit again soon.",5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
I had a very nice tomato stack salad with ROOM's own steak sauce dressing - I've got to get the recipe!!! I also had boneless short ribs over paparadelle - Excellent! I will return!,4,FooD,San Francisco
The Aloe drink was very good. One of the best that I have had. A good cross experience of American and Asia food on the menu. Tomato bisque soup was one of the best that I have had.,5,Barney,Jacksonville
We arrived early (5:00pm) and they didn't seem quite ready for an after work crowd - but the patio turned out to be a great place to sit and unwind. Burgers and beers were great. I hope more people will discover this great patio.,3,JustBee,Atlanta
"My first visit was excellent. On my second visit, perhaps it was due to the Restaurant Week menu and discounted prices, but our group found the food to be underwhelming.",2,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"This is the first restaurant that I've been to during Atlanta Restaurant Week that served from their actual menu and the food was AWESOME!!! The restaurant is very small and there were a few ""White Tees"" hanging out at the bar (maybe they were staying at the hotel) that brought the ambiance down slightly. The service was nice and attentive. Derrick suggested a blue-lemonade drink (alcoholic) that was really good. ROOM @ 12 now goes into my top 10!",4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
This was a good choice for restaurant week. everything was great from food to service.,5,randy,Atlanta
The evening was in celebration of a birthday. The food and service was excellent. I would highly recommend to others.,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Of course, I went for restaurant week and the food was awesome! the chicken croquettes and the trout were amazing! I took my 4-month-old daughter and that was a task. There was not much room for a stroller... the service was good!",4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Very generous &amp; tasty for restaurant week. First impression was the real disappointment &amp; the reason we will most likely not return. Valet was not present upon arrival. Thought he was parking a vehicle (not a big deal) but then a few minutes seemed like enternity. My wife &amp; her friend had to let themselves out. Turns out the frumpy valet was in the office. He was rude &amp; I considered leaving. Similar story upon leaving, even after speaking with the room's manager.  Not going to make it with first impressions like this..........",3,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
The trout was a little bland and the oreo dessert is not a real oreo. It was two cookies with icing in the middle.,3,WeDontCook,Atlanta
It was a great dinner and we truly enjoyed the experience!,4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
The wine list is outstanding - great selections at all price points. The food was perfect - everything we ordered was delicious. Thanks for a great experience.,5,DCdiner,Atlanta
"Excellent service. Our trip was terrible at first b/c of a hotel incident at the Westin. However, luckily I made dinner reservations at Room and it turned our whole trip around. The next time I'm in Atlanta, I will definitely stay at the Twelve Hotel and enjoy the Room's wonderful food again.",5,OpenTable Diner,Charlotte
"Dining at Room At Twelve was a very good experience and my birthday dinner was as tasty as the presentation. Our waiter, Roland,was very professional and friendly, overall it was a goodnight in Atlanta. The only problem was that the restaurant ran out of desserts and it was ""restaurant week"" in Atlanta, so I guess it was due to poor planning, but overall it is worth giving them a second chance in the future.",4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Food was ok, but the overall experience was sub-par. I know it was Restaurant Week, but we were rushed to the point of having dinner arrive before we were even done with our appetizers! The food was only ok. Chicken croquettes tasted like they were reheated from Costco. The main course was the best -- hanger steak and trout were both good, but I wouldn't go to the restaurant just for them. The desserts were only ok -- creme brulee was good, but the peach cake clearly was made with canned peaches, and the ""oreos"" were tasteless and not good.",3,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"If you want a tender cut of meat DON""T get the ""Hangar Steak"". The appetizers were delicious as was the dessert, but the entree left me wishing I'd have gotten the chicken.",3,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"My wife and I had a very enjoyable time. The service, food and atmosphere were excellent. As we both love fine dining, this was a great find. I want to return so we can enjoy the bar scene which looked vibrant, friendly and exciting.",5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Amazing all-you-can-eat sushi and bottomless sake special on Wednesday nights! The desserts are great, too.",5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
I enjoy eating at the room. The customer service is outstanding and personel is very attentive. This is one of my favorite resturants.,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Very eclectic menu and a very modern spacious atmosphere.,5,atlbaltdiners,Atlanta
"we went on a Wed night for the bottomless sushi. The sushi selection was ok. Spicy Salmon, spicy tuna, Eel and california roll. I think they used a different grade of fish for the bottomless deal. If we had paid full price for these rolls we would have been very disappointed. Our waiter was very nice and service was good. But, they were dead and I don't see that place being open in a month. I wouldn't go back again. There are far better palces for your $$",2,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"We chose Room at Twelve for our 25th Wedding Anniversary Dinner. The atmosphere set a wonderfully romantic mood for the evening that was only surpassed by the excellent food, signature drinks and accommodating hospitality of the entire staff! I can’t imagine us making a better selection!!!!",5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Very disappointing! I ordered the ""crab"" and shrimp sliders. The crab was imitation crab with the red dye outer casing. Shocking! And the shrimp tasted like canned baby shrimp which it might have been. Overall the dish was bland, not to mention not what I thought it was going to be. Our waiter miss handled our orders in the beginning (wrongs soups and salad already dressed as opposed to one the side). One of our guests went without water until the person came around to refill everyone elses glass. And they were not that busy so that is not an excuse they can use. My entire table found the food just so, so.",3,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Unfortunately we had to eat and run to get to the Fox Theatre for a performance. Still the food was good and we enjoyed it. The server wasn't particularly great at handling a ""can not share"" sushi special, but it was o.k.",4,OpenTable Diner,Los Angeles
"We visited the Room at Twelve during the Memorial holiday weekend and although it was empty, the service and food was superb.",5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Everyone was awesome from the host to the waiter. I mentioned to the host that I brought my friend here for her birthday. He must have relayed the message to the waiter because they brought out complimentary ice cream at the end of dinner. I would definitely come back and recommend it to my fellow sushi eaters.,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"This is one of Amick's gem's, yet mostly unsdiscovered by locals. Now doing a great wine deal on the ""good wine list"" Fri/Sat to get the weekend/local crowd up...plus promos w/ Open Table and others. Great value, food, and (especially) service. Our servers were awesome and super conversational. Beautiful place to boot. And honestly, for downtown, very easy to get in and out of. Will be back...and am telling friends of the weekend deals!",5,SteveH,Atlanta
Lunch was amazing as always. This is one of my favorites for lunch!!!,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Room at Twelve provided the usual top quality service. Setting, design and decor are all outstanding. Sushi specials were great and three of my four guests enjoyed them. My 6oz filet was overdone (Well done vs medium ordered) This is the first time I've ever had an issue with food at Room at Twelve",5,PTCguy,Atlanta
We went in for the $10 bottomless sushi. It was a good deal for the price.,4,Otto,Atlanta
"The food was average at best, but the real downside was the noise level, it was so loud that it was impossible to have normal conversation during dinner. the table we were seated at made it impossible for the server to actually serve everyone at the table (this was a table of 4). I was really hoping for something special, but felt VERY shortchanged. I will not be coming back or refering this to anyone I know. And it was amusing that we had bread plates, but not even a slice of bread with the meal.",2,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Visited to celebrate birthday with my wife.  Had two exceptional  meals, the lobster tail with a tenderloin added for me and the Hanger Steak signature plate for my wife.  Both were very tasty. Ordered the recommended Cabernet special wine and it did prove excellent.  Started with the mushroom bruschetta, excellent also.  Service was very good and the waiter, Jake, very personable, attentive, and helpful.",5,BirthdayBob,Detroit
"Absolutely amazing service, and the food was top notch! Our waiter, Tim, was very attentive without being overly so. We ordered the prime rib, which we found out afterwards was on special, and the French onion soup. Probably the best French onion soup we’ve ever tasted! The prime was done perfectly medium rare, and the taste was out of this world (especial when adding the au joux!). We are definitely going back.",5,OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 3, 2018"
"Snowy night, seated promptly.  Wait staff outstanding.  Found a great, but not well-known cabernet (Trefethen 2013) at a decent price (for it).  Had the shrimp cocktail, which was chopped but good.  The crostini with mushrooms and boursin was great.  Everybody ordered a steak and were extremely pleased.  One was slightly over cooked, but he said it was still very good. French green bean side was excellent.  Overall, what I hoped for when I booked the reservation, casual, good menu, good service and good food. Now on my list of places to go whenever I'm in Grand Rapids.",4,jwwii,Detroit
We went to Judson's to celebrate my wife's birthday and had a great dining experience.  Food was excellent and service from waiter Jake was outstanding.  We will be back.  Still our favorite restaurant in Grand Rapids.,5,Maculman,Detroit
"Its been a few years since our last visit to Judson's and I would say that it continues to live up to its expectations. We loved the Crab Cakes and Wine options. My wife had the lobster and said it was delicious, I tried the Prime Rib special but would probably steak with a steak next time as that seems to be their main strength. It seemed louder than I remember before, so its definitely not the place to go if you are looking for a quiet meal. We usually make a night of it at the Bob and enjoy a show at Dr Grins, drinks at one of the many bars and dinner at Judson's.",4,mongoose88,Detroit
Everything was really good. Only thing I would recommend is getting some better steak knives. Seriously those thing need to be replaced.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"I would not recommend Judson’s for a dinner before any event in Grand Rapids, unless you have a reservation at least 3 hours prior to it. Our waitress served us drinks and appetizer and then disappeared.   Our reservation was 1 1/2 hours prior to a show at Van Andel and we missed the start by 15 minutes.",1,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Made reservations for dinner before seeing Jeff Dunham at Van Andel. The food was fantastic. Started with the crab cakes and the bone marrow. Both were exceptional. Then the Delmonico and New York strip steaks; both made to our specifications. The only negative I have is that their spicy Bloody Mary was lackluster. All-in-all, a great evening.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Highly overrated............picked Judson's so we could be close to the area.,1,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Awesome waitress. Phenomenal food. Great business meal.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Simply put this is the best steak I have ever had. My son and I took my wife out for her birthday. He and I had the tomahawk steak for two. She had the lobster. We all agreed this was in the top five meals we have had in 20 Years.,5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Great dinner with our family!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Celebrated my wife's birthday at Judson's last Thursday, and had two amazing dinners: a free lobster tail for my wife, and a blackened hangar steak for me. Each entrée was fabulous, as was the huge baked potato that we ordered to share. We also shared a wedge salad to start our meal - more that enough for sharing. The salad was a bit over-dressed and soggy, but otherwise delicious! Service was extremely friendly and helpful, but was surprisingly slow, given that the restaurant was ~80% empty. Overall, an enjoyable food experience, and we will certainly be back.",5,SecondTimeJenison,Grand Rapids
Our food was fantastic. I had the 16 oz. Delmonico and my wife had their Pime Rib.  The clam chowder was great. The service was also outstanding.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Arrived and no one was at the hostess stand. We waited 3-4 minutes and then asked the bartender for help. Still took a few more minutes for someone to greet us.   We then were told they did not have our reservation. I pulled up the confirmation and the hostess said they must have given it to someone else and we needed to wait so they could clear a table for us. We were sat at a booth right next to the kitchen door, which was loud and not ideal. We were told our server would be with us in 5-7 minutes.  Not a good start...  Food was great, service was fine, although we felt rushed. This was an 8 o’clock reservation, which I understand is a little late for Grand Rapids, but the restaurant is open until 11, so there should have been no need to hurry us out.   It was apparent that they were understaffed for a Saturday night.  If we go back we will probably avoid going during the weekend.",3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Hello,  My husband and I came to Judson's steakhouse to enjoy a nice meal. We had been really looking forward to coming to this establishment again.  However, we were disappointed. It wasn't a terribly busy night and we made reservations. It took 30 minutes for our waitress to come over and get us our drinks. The hostess actually had to get us water beforehand because we requested it.  By the time we finally met our waitress she said ""I apologize I just got distracted.""  We then waited another 20 minutes for our second round of drinks.  I try to understand how a restaurant runs but I also expect exceptional service and unfortunately that's not what I received tonight.  Thank you for your time.",3,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
Very enjoyable dining experience.,5,vegasexperience,Las Vegas
We are glad we made the choice to eat at Judson’s for my birthday this year! Not only do they have amazing Gregslist offers but the food was awesome and the service was amazing! I will be back for more and not just on my birthday this is a great date night out!!,5,JAX05,Detroit
"Came to Judson's for my Birthday, greeted and seated immediately by the hostess. Shortly after we were greeted by our waiter Jake, who was very knowledgeable with the menu, offered recommendations  and was super friendly. The dinner was unrushed as we were in no hurry but could be if you were. The food was excellent and the ambiance was just perfect for our occasion. I highly recommend Judson's for a truly wonderful experience!!",5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"Great food, great atmosphere!",5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Christmas work dinner. Great stuffed fillet and the bar tender is always great to let experiment with your pallet.,5,OpenTable Diner,Cincinnati
Great service and great food from locally sourced areas.,5,Sanjz,Detroit
"Even though located in downtown Grand Rapids, parking was nearby and convenient. Nice atmosphere, relatively private seating. My steak, the Delmonico, was quite good and, although expensive, was a typical price for a good steakhouse. I especially enjoyed the brussels sprouts on the side. What is also nice is that the restaurant is across the street from Van Andel Arena, which is great if you are going to a show or a hockey game.",4,Nice,Las Vegas
the waiters did not know what they were doing salads were served before appetizer was finished and same with the main course,3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
I really enjoy the place.. it was a special place to go on a date. It was quiet and the service was excellent!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
entrees very good. asparagus was under cooked and very woody.,4,Dick,Grand Rapids
Excellent meal and service. Prime Rib and Hangar steak were delicious! Best baked potato ever. Loved our server!,5,Cindy,Detroit
"My wife and I visited Judson's on a Friday night in early January. At 6:00 p.m., the restaurant was quite quiet, though it did fill up as the evening progressed. The food was excellent and presented well.  We both enjoyed the hangar steak. Each was cooked to our different specifications and was delicious. The staff was courteous and helpful without being too officious. Atmosphere was just what we needed after a busy week.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Good service and food but make sure to run beer taps a little bit when first opening for the evening to clear the off taste with first pours to customers.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Great venue and wait staff was very good.  Unfortunately all three of our steaks were over cooked / seared to long on one side.    Waiter provide free dessert which were excellent .  Hopefully a one time mistake,3,OpenTable Diner,Caribbean
"The meal  was excellent, though I was not particularly fond of the grilled Brussel sprouts - a bit too cooked/burnt and I did not care for the onions included with them. Overall, though, very good. The steak was great - a filet mignon sort of steak; really good! And the server was great - lots of personality and fun to  have serve us. We will definitely be back, but probably only for a special occasion, as was this night - dinner before going to Les Miz at DeVos Place.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Wonderful experience all around. Thumbs way up!!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"My wife and I recently celebrated my birthday at Judson's. We had great food (hangar steak and lobster tail) and great friendly and helpful service. The only downside was that food service was exceptionally slow, even though the restaurant was nearly empty (Thursday night). Still, we enjoyed our evening, and the food quality really made for a great experience.",5,SecondTimeJenison,Grand Rapids
"Expertly prepared roasted marrow bone and extremely delicious baseball steak Oscar.  Service was super too.  Thank you Melinda!  I'm not from the area and the last time we were in Grand Rapids we made the mistake of going to Ruth's Chris'.  What a disappointment that was.  Truth be known, I'm  rarely a steakhouse kind of guy but here, I'll make the exception.  I'll definitely be back.",4,BobZiel,Philadelphia
I really enjoy the beef tenderloin with  demi-glace .  The servers are thoughtful and helpful.,5,AaronHE,San Francisco
Enjoyed their signature Delmonica steak.  Very good crispy brussel sprouts and the tomato herb butter that came with the bread was delicious.  Good atmosphere and great service.  Not cheap but not too overpriced either.,5,80JC,Grand Rapids
Food was delicious; service was excellent; overall experience.  Our first time at Judson's and we'll definitely come again.  A perfect experience before going to the play.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
the food was just so so for price my steak was very fatty,3,OpenTable Diner,Orlando
"Great service, fantastic food and drinks.  Very nice atmosphere.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"It was good but not great.  It was not on par with the Chicago Steakhouses nor does it rival the decore.  Very overpriced and just average for the steak.  They missed on the French Onion soup by leaving bay leaf in the soup. Almost motel like, not unique.",4,OpenTable Diner,Orlando
The restaurant is wonderful. Our waitress was outstanding. We had 3 little kids and a baby and she was so attentive and helpful. Most our meals were delicious. The corn beef dinner we believe should have been more tender it would have been falling apart tender and was not. Wish they had real ketchup for the fries. But overall highly recommend Iron.,4,lasttime,Orlando
Friendly staff and the new menu is an improvement. We would come back to the IRON.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
We had good service.  However the appetizers for the price was not great.  The meat and cheese plate was over priced for what you got.,3,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
We were seated quickly and the service was very good.  We were close to the front door but not too close - but whenever the door opened we could feel the cold air come in.    Just wondering if there is a way to prevent that.  All was good and I would recommend the restaurant to others.,3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
It was a great experience.  The restaurant has a great style inside. Except for the strange scented candles that they had randomly throughout the place. They were all different and took a nice relaxing restaurant and kind of turned into a dorm room feeling.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Having heard a lot about Iron we were anxious to finally get there with some friends.  It certainly did not disappoint.   We had a few drinks in the bar pre-dinner.  The bartenders were friendly and fun.  The food was quite good and cooked to perfection.  We will definitely be coming back soon and often.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"We went to Iron for appetizers and drinks before a concert, and loved it!  Great food, service, and drinks.",5,OpenTable Diner,Washington DC
The tables are close together and several tables get a rush of cold air everytime the door opens.  Our server was friendly but kinda awkward on the times she chose to check on us. Food was good but a little pricey for what you get.  I would go back during the warmer months only.,3,RachD,Grand Rapids
"Restaurant was out of two entrees (walleye and pork),  chicken was too salty for my taste, nothing is served in iron skillets anymore, and menu seems much smaller than what shows online.  Thankfully the wine and company were excellent!  Probably will not return.",2,JilG,Grand Rapids
"Love the simplicity of this restaurant. The service was good - friendly and efficient. The timing of the food was off - took a short time for the appetizers and the dinners took a long time to come after that. We ordered the picnic and poutine - both very good. The porkchop was tasty, but very tough. Had a hard time cutting through with a steak knife. The sides were delicious and the bar menu was great. Two people in our party had the salmon - it looked delicious. Seared on the outside and medium in the middle. I was also under the impression that the food was SERVED in a CAST IRON SKILLET? I guess not. Not sure the connection between the name and the food. Also, had talked up a skillet macaroni and cheese but it wasn't on the menu. Hmmm...still good food. Will go back.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Our food was awesome, as was our service. I would recommend dining here when its a little warmer outside. With it being a smaller space and having 3 entrance doors, no matter where you sit (we were seated near a side door) any time a door opened we were blasted with super cold air. Our server brought me two mugs of warm water to hold:) which was great, but with warmer weather I think you'd be able to enjoy the actual dining experience a little more.",4,BrownMD,Grand Rapids
"Restaurant was ice cold.  Restaurant has a separate eating area for large parties but wait staff has to access this area by opening side doors, making their main restaurant ice cold.  Other parties had guest eating with stocking caps and mittens on.  As for the menu, the restaurant might want to invest in a computer printer. Every fish item has been replace with other offerings and the steak special was sold out.  2 members of our party, ordered the hanger steak, it was served cold and onion ring on top must have been cooked 2 hours before service.   The shrimp and grits were enjoyed by members of our party and their dish came out hot. Appreciated mangers attempt to make evening better by comping dessert. Apples in crisp were under cooked and dish had no flavor. Bread pudding and brownie was enjoyed by group.",2,BPS22,San Francisco
"Pretty good. Not a top downtown spot, but I'd try it again.",3,GRJules,Tahoe
"Great entree options and craft cocktails. Unfortunately, they were out of 2 of the entrees which only left a few options. We also order the dessert on special and had to send it back twice (two orders of it) because both times, both deserts were burnt. They did not charge us for the dessert, but was disappointed they didn’t offer a different dessert as well.",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Small space, cold in the winter months no matter how far from the door you are seated. There are several tacky space heaters positioned near the bar area, but that does little for the other tables. They were out of several specials (to be expected) but they were also out of several main entrees on the menu. They were also out of two or three different wines &amp; bubbly; it was NYE, but they should have planned accordingly. It seemed easier to ask “what aren’t you out of” when ordering. It took over an hour to get our mains. Water glasses sat empty far too long. The food we could actually order was subpar. The grilled cheese was extremely salty, &amp; the bread is crusted in cheese so it’s a little over the top. It might be good to share, but not as your full meal. We managed a $90 bill for two &amp; will spend our money on better food and better service somewhere else next time.",2,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Great dinner. Lots of options. Open Table gave us a 3:45 reservation although the restaurant didn't open until 4. They were confused. Meal was delicious, server was very attentive. Nice atmosphere.",5,MichaelM,Detroit

Dined at IRON on Christmas Eve. Everything was perfect! Love this place.,5,shoppro,Grand Rapids
"Disappointed that our party of 4 reserved a high top via Open Table (it makes you choose table type for this restaurant) and got seated at a low top right next to a family - and I mean right next. Like we were practically all sitting at the same table. Low top tables are quite close together so not very private for conversations. Inquired as we saw an empty hightop and was told the table type portion doesnt show up on their iPad and the only open high top was ""booked."" Hmm... I booked one, so somebody else was more important?  However, the food was FANTASTIC. Best steaks ever, awesome swordfish special etc. Waiter's attentiveness diminished once we got our food. Had to flag him down to order desert and drink glasses were empty more than once. But the food was so good that we will give it another try!",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Five of us had a Saturday night dinner.  Both exterior doors to the restaurant were next to tables, blowing in the sub-freezing night when anyone arrived or left, making many seating locations quite uncomfortable.  Our meal took well over one hour from ordering to delivery and most items were cold upon arrival.  The food would have been good had it not been cold.  The staff recognized the issues, was very apologetic and provided free dessert.  The staff did what it could.  But unless the conduct of the kitchen can be improved, we could not recommend it.",2,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Really cold in the booth by the opening door to the patio, other than that all was good",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Potatoes were not cooked all the way on three of the four meals served and salmon was overcooked in one meal.  Seats were a little uncomfortable. Great service, nice wine list, loved the picnic appetizer.",3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Parking is nearly impossible plan on spending 10 plus dollars on parking on non event days more on event days. We had a family of four 3 adults and a child which apparently warrants less than average service. Food was mediocre on quality and time. We had a variety of food filet,salmon,meat loaf &amp; kids grilled cheese. Salmon was less than appetizing I'm not one to eat the skin on salmon and all of the seasoning for the fish was on the sling that was a crispy layer easy to peal off.. Filet was cooked appropriately carrots that came with were rabbit style as in you could munch for hours because of how hard they were.. grilled cheese was supposed to have  Gouda but was just a basic muenster sandwich less than toasted on soggy whit bread.. Meat loaf was meat loaf jars to mess up ...",1,OpenTable Diner,Denver
Food was excellent although the potatoes were over done.  Service was not too good.,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Service was good, very friendly and nice. We ordered an app (crap cakes) that had no taste and was like a spongy cake. Waiter understood and brought out a different app (no charge) bread and fish dip. It was ok (better) however bread too was spongy.   Also people coming in and out of the doors to another area brought in cold wind to us and with the high tables felt too crowded. The steaks I would say were ok to good. I usually never leave reviews and week before ate at Cygnus, butchers, Sovengard and Terras but unfortunately I am leaving this review in hopes things will change and I will try again in the future.",2,Jonn,Grand Rapids
"Every time we go to Iron it has been GREAT, introduced to friends and family and everyone loves the atmosphere, Food, Service EVERYTHING!!!!  All Food is supplied Locally and is yummy.  I have not been disappointed yet and have been there 3 times, dishes I recommend are their Meatloaf, Pot Roast &amp; Walleye - all great dishes.   Staff is very attentive to all guest.  We will keep coming back.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids

It was too loud for a date night. But very energetic for a group outing.,3,RibeyeLover,Grand Rapids
Outstanding food and a great selection on the menu. I loved the walleye. The steak with mushrooms was one of the best meals my son has had. We don’t drink so can’t comment on the bar choices but it seemed like a fun place to get a drink.  The waitress was excellent. Made sure we had plenty of time to walk to devos center to see les miserables. Will definitely return next time I’m in Grand Rapids.,5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"Terrible.  Would never recommend. Food was below average, price was outrageous.",2,Nemoeight,Grand Rapids
"IRON is a solid choice for a downtown date night option. It's in a great location and has a great interior design/elegant feel to it without being too pretentious. Meals are moderately priced and very tasty.  The staff was nice but nothing above ordinary. All in all, IRON is a nice destination if you're not ready to spend top dollar at some of the other ore high end  fine dining downtown.",4,SteveB,Grand Rapids
"First of all forget about parking, they have no parking and no valet.  I had to park 2 blocks away. They ran out 4 things on the menu. The waiter was very nice and very patient, as we were very disappointed when he told us 4 things on the menu were not available.  I had the pork chop and it was just ok.  For dessert we had the Apple Crisp, but it was frigid cold. You will not see me come back.",1,Chitin,Dallas

"Brought my daughter, who was visiting on business, to lunch at Wheelhouse.  She had the Kale salad and I had the crab cakes and a cup of Chicken Tortilla soup.  We also split the deviled eggs as an appetizer.  All were delicious!  The deviled eggs are quite unique, from the green goddess-based filling to the deep-fried shell on the outside of the egg white.  Was quite surprised that the restaurant wasn't more busy, so hoping business is thriving!  Wheelhouse is a great restaurant, and I would recommend it for all occasions!",5,GaryG,Grand Rapids
"My waitress was awesome! The food was really good! Thanks for a great experience, I'll be back next week!",5,OpenTable Diner,Mobile
We had dinner with some friends.  We had asked for a quite booth and they delivered.  Service was good but I expect the server at this level of restaurant to be more aware.  Before our food he should have made we had clean utensils or replace utensils that were taken away with the appetizers.  The meal was excellent but felt a little over priced same with the cocktails.,4,Niki,Grand Rapids
Went for a family birthday event with our adult kids and had an awesome time and dining experience.  This was our first time to Wheelhouse and we will be planning a trip back soon.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids

The waitress was exceptional.  The food was just very underwhelming.  The steak didn't seem seasoned at all and wasn't the right temperature. One of the other dinners had fish and enjoyed it.  Two of us had steak and it wasn't very good.,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids

"We were very happy with our trip to Wheelhouse.    Our server suggested a fantastic goat cheese appetizer.   The best thing about Wheelhouse is the place can be completely full and with great sound management in the design of the dining area, you can’t engage in conversation with out screaming at your companions.     That’s reason enough to put it on the regular rotation",5,OpenTable Diner,Washington DC

"Blah, so I will start with the good parts, service, ice tea, and fresh fruit.  Everything else is lacking.  So the pork chop was a dry as Phoenix in the summer.  The meatloaf was undesirable even for a meatloaf connoisseur like myself.  Normally open table (99 out of 100) steers me in a right direction and helps discover some true gems, but this was the 1 out of 100 that was lacking.  Sadly, I would avoid if at all possible.",1,USMC3048,Houston

"Enjoyed the atmosphere and plates. The USDA Prime NY Strip was fairly good, but requested medium-rare and it came out medium. Was not as tender as most USDA Prime beef. Could have been seasoned a bit more BUT it was overall very nice and the price was good for being billed as a USDA Prime beef selection. The Salmon and chicken dishes were very good and tasty. The appetizer chicken wings and the onion soup was nice as well. We look forward to coming back.",4,Gunner2000,Detroit
Awesome!  Will definitely go back!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"I had the pork chop and my boyfriend had the chicken. The chicken was good but the pork chop was so over done I could barley cut it with a steak knife. The flavor was good but so overdone. The price was moderate to high and I was expecting the food to match the price. We did not have time to send my dinner back because we were headed to a concert. We allotted an hour for dinner and the food came out 35 minutes later, which we thought was normal for a busy night.",3,RandiRae,Denver
Got to our table slightly early but had to wait for one person of our party. Waitress was attentive but made us feel very welcome and comfortable.  Our final person arrived and we had a wonderful dinner together.,4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago

"Jordan was, as always, an outstanding server and the ambience just can’t be topped!  Wheelhouse is always on the top of the list of our dining choices in GR.  We brought friends for Christmas dinner; unfortunately the chefs special of monk fish wrapped in bacon wasn’t the best example of your fabulous menu and all four of us ordered it after considerable praise from Jordan.  I wish some of us had ordered other entrees as the monk fish was dry and overwhelmed by the saltiness of the bacon which was greatly over cooked.  The cocktails, appetizers and service were excellent and our dining partners said they would definitely give it another try.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids

"Our party of four with seated next to a very large party. Our table was barely large enough for two; the menus didn’t fit and we had to remove the centerpiece to have space for wine. The food was flavorless and was not served hot. The service was indifferent, at best, and did not effectively handle small “special” requests.",2,LLBE,Atlanta

Marco's is a hidden gem and the hostess is always a delight.  Our server which I cannot remember her name was very attentive.  Only criticism I have is each time I have gone I always have to ask for bread it is never brought to the table with your salad.,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Ever see Caddy Shack where Rodney Dangerfiekd walks into the Golf Club and insults all the nattily dressed white haired waspy members? That is what it felt like dining at this place. Food was VERY good. Wait staff was also very good and the owner came by the table and was very friendly. It just seemed like the ""19th hole"" of a count try club.  All the white hairs men were in the same Andrea's sport costs, white shirt and tan pants. Turns out THERE iS a golf club across the street. BTW-the flourless chocolate tort was incredible.",4,Shep,Memphis
"Wonderful food, excellent service, quiet and relaxing. Fabulous pianist.",5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"We love Marco's.  The food is always wonderful and we love the piano music during dinner.  It is just soft enough to be in the background but we are still able to have good conversation.  We loved being seated at a round table, again because conversation is easier with the entire group and we can see everyone.   I rated it lower overall because the service was not up to par.  One member of our table ordered the sea bass in salt and it came our first.  The waitress was not completely confident in the filet process.  The other meals came out one by one rather than all at once and one member did not receive their meal until much, much later than the rest.  The group, being polite, waited and the members who selected fish had cold food by the time everyone was served.  The restaurant was not at all packed and busy the evening we ate there so I don't think this was a factor.  For the price (over $350 for a group of six), this was just not acceptable.  Again, we love Marco's and will come again but would love for the service to be more in line with the food which is exceptional.",3,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"The staff made our experience highly enjoyable.  They were friendly and welcoming and joined in congratulating us on our anniversary.  There were a few kitchen glitches, but the staff and service more than made up for them.",5,Meredith,Atlanta

"I have always been a fan until this visit. I lived in the area for months and used to go frequently. I went back this last time with hopes of  good food and good service that I have had before. Well, no such luck! The chicken was dry and the service was horrid. I'm sorry if I don't look older and distinguished like some of your guests may look. You asked what was wrong and why there was 85-90% of the chicken left and we told you it was dry. You asked if we wanted something to replace it and we said no because we had been there for almost two hours already and still had another hour and a half drive. Well Marco you just lost someone who used to be a fan, sing your praises and recommended to everyone that I could.",2,WWPJDO,Atlanta

Weekend brunch or an evening dinner, there literally isn’t a thing on the menu you won’t like. The staff is amazing and the food and drinks are all hand crafted and made with local ingredients. This is the absolute best restaurant south of Atlanta.",5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
We had visitor from California and wanted to treat her to brunch,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Dovetail has a great atmosphere and the service is outstanding. The seating is comfortable. My daughter commented on how great the background music was. We went for brunch. The vegetable omelet was excellent. The fried chicken on the Chicken Benedict was disappointing. The elements of the dish (including the chicken breading) were very good, but the chicken itself lacked flavor.  The hash included with the Winter Standard was sweet, which was unexpected. Overall it was a good experience and we will be back.",4,OpenTable Diner,Birmingham
The reservation was for 3:00 pm and the restaurant did not open until 8 pm which left us nowhere to eat before the game. We would have booked elsewhere if this had not been listed.   Very very disappointing,1,Usuallybetter,Atlanta
I brought several friends from out of town and was soo embarrassed. It took over a hour too receive our drinks. When the waitress came too give my friends their drinks. I was informed the ingredients for my drink were not available. This drink was on the menu. I ordered crab cakes was told they were not available. Tried too order turkey sliders were told they were not available.  I do not blame the wait staff. I blame management for the service. The restrooms were nasty and disgusting. I will not be coming back too this establishment!!!! Or even recommending it.,1,OpenTable Diner,Adelaide / SA
"We were totally thrown off-guard!!!   The ""League Tavern"" does not need to be open unless their is a special event or function!!!   We was stunned not to mention the ""Roof-Top"" was ""Dark,"" and the ""Food"" was HORRIBLE!!!!  The ""League Tavern"" is ""Not"" a good place to Celebrate a special occasion!",3,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Both food and service were bad. Food took an extremely long time to come out. Once it did arrive, some orders were missing,  the food wasn’t well prepared or tasty and Some of it was cold. Our server was disorganized and repeatedly complained that she had to go up to the third level and come back down to our table on the first level. Would not recommend this establishment at all.",2,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Dovetail is consistently a wonderful restaurant to enjoy. Never have we ever been disappointed. The food is always wonderful and spot-on and the staff is so knowledgeable, warm and friendly, that you leave in a better mood than when you entered.",5,OpenTable Diner,Orlando
"First time visit was not disappointed. Explored the tastes of the put ups and cheese plate, the pork chop was thick but cooked to perfection. (Still very tender). My wife said the filet was the best she had tasted. Afterwards we had a cocktail at the bar, a special shout out to Chelsea the bar manager who knows everything  there is to know about your favorite drink, and her passion shows.",5,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
"All fine. At one point waiter forgot about us. Otherwise, waiter was excellent",4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"If you are a parent DO NOT GO DOVETAIL!! It all started by me and my husband wanting to eat some good quality food while in the road back home to Florida. I chose dovetail because it looked like a place where we could have an adult meal and still have our 13 month old with us. But boy, I was wrong !!! When we finally got to our main course and our little one was chilling playing with his toys on the floor, the manager told us he was not welcomed on” the floor” and he needed to get back on his high chair. So, naturally I asked for an explanation, and apparently a child in the floor is not accepted under their “dining standards”. We did not even finished a third of our $30 meals! The funny think is that the manager,or whoever he was told us, that  “they provided a chair and a corner table” To accommodate our child! Like if we should be grateful for their kindness. So upsetting! So, do NOT dare to pretend to be a parent of bring a child to this place where the floor is not even good enough for them to be on 👎🏼👎🏼",2,Nathy,Jacksonville
"We really enjoyed ourselves at Dovetail. The atmosphere was really nice, and the service was great. The food was fresh, and delightfully delicious. I definitely recommend Dovetail for a great dining experience. We will be back!",5,RonLewis,Atlanta
"Always wonderful to dine at Dovetail. The people, the food, the service, the drinks are perfection. Our favorite!",5,StacyL,San Francisco
"Not great. Had three of the small plates. Would get 3 scallops next time. The quail and the venison were disappointing.  Not impressed at all. Scallops as stated, were good.",4,Taylor,Birmingham
One of my favorite spots for locally sourced veggies and  meats creatively prepared.  Professional wait staff and excellent bar tender for daily special drinks.,5,Lily,Charleston
"Overall, excellent!",4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Overall the food was fair...the blackened catfish was not good as the fish was swimming in the grits when it came to the table and was messy.  Would be better if they were separated leaving the fish firmer and easier to digest.  Otherwise, every other meal was good to the guests, only 2 threw theirs away.",2,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Loved the restaurant. This was a December day, and the air conditioning was on so high in the wine room, it was uncomfortable.",4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Perfect. Go.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"A bit cramped, limited menu, but food is generally good.  Nice ambiance. Pricey for what you get.",4,JonathanC,Atlanta
Excellent service as well as food.  My sea bass entree was likely the best ever!,5,fnewman,New York Area
"This was the worst experience I have had at Dovetail of my many times here.  I recommend this restaurant highly to clients and guest however, Friday night was the worst meal I have eaten here.  The Shrimp cocktail was delicious, perfectly  the burgers, both burgers appeared to have been prepped before hand, bacon hard, not fresh and more or less small pieces of bacon.  The burger did not taste fresh, very greasy and the buns appeared to have been microwaved, thus mushy and a mess to eat.  French fries not properly cooked or seasoned well.  Plus, pickles were small and lost in the mushy bun.    I will continue to eat here, maybe just an off night!  I really hope so.  Thanks. Taffy",2,TAFFYS,Atlanta
"Very pleased and hit the mark.  We were there for business and we needed to be able to talk/hear each other, have a good meal, and have a productive business meal/meeting.  The food, service, staff, and overall experience was excellent.  We will be back.",5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Dovetail has the best drinks in town and the best food, too. The atmosphere is wonderful and the staff are all incredible. I can't recommend Dovetail highly enough!",5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Wonderful food, great service and very accommodating to all our needs. This was an excellent restaurant. Anything you order will meet your expectations. We would have liked some recognition of the birthday celebration.",4,Yummy,Atlanta
"We had a very nice time as I took 3 friends out to celebrate a retirement. The only complaint I have is, the day of the dinner I received a call to confirm the reservation and was told someone else will be seated at our table at 830 ( our reservation was for 630). I’m not sure if this is commonplace but it took me by surprise. At that point it was too late to book elsewhere. It worked out, we weren’t rushed out but I did feel a little sheepish as we stayed later than 830!!",4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Quite possibly one of the best deals around, especially now that the revamped their menu and added a much higher-end selection of entrees and steaks. Best steak value in town. It's probably best to call in advance for reservations during peak times. Friendly, knowledgeable staff that has been around for a long time.  Try one the Wagyu steak selections, with Filet, New York and Top Sirloin cuts available from $18-40!  Also, they have a pretty good selection of wines on their by-the-glass, and reserve wine lists. Only open for dinner.",4,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Was looking for an upscale restaurant in Macon to treat our Mercer College Student.   The food was just ok.  I had the shrimp and grits.  Disappointing.  Portions were small as well.    Expected more from the food.  The server was good and very helpful.,3,tonys,"Dined on February 2, 2018"
New memu limited in it's attraction. For a steakhouse to offer only 3 cuts of Prime beef seems limited.  Not my best experience. Won't be back in the near future.,2,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Not crowded at all. The food was great and service was excellent.,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"The website ""special"" of a 2 course meal for $13.95 was a little deceptive. Although the quality was very good, the portions were very small and we left still hungry. I wouldn't recommend going there for simply for the website special. Also, we had to ask our waiter for the ""special"" menu, almost apologetically. I guess we had different expectations for a 2 course meal. It would have been nice if the website had mentioned that the portions were very petite.",3,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"The food was ""so-so.""  The prime aged steak was (appropriately for the price) tender and delicious.  The chuck ""tender"" grisly--it could not be cut with the steak knife provided by the restaurant.  Food timing also needed work.  The sides were cold--literally cold.  I bit into a piece of broccoli and shocked myself with a fridge-like temperature... Excellent ambiance and decor... romantic, quiet.... completely at odds with a loud, assertive waitress who asked poking personal questions and turned every interaction into a joke.  Finally-arrived at 6:15pm-- only 9 tables full, waited 20 minutes to order, and waited 55 minutes for food.",2,ComProf,Detroit
"great steaks, huge sides, make sure your share the sides.  Ask for Bruce to be your server, he is by far the best waiter and is extremely helpful.",5,Gramstef,Chicago
We went to Judson for our 1st wedding anniversary.  The Prime Rib was outstanding.  Bruce our server was on top of what he had to do.  He was very polite and Professional.  The Manager was great also.  He came over to the table and congratulated us on our anniversary and gave us a bottle of champagne.  Great place I will defiantly go back.,5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
I would highly recommend Judsons steakhouse for any type of occasion weather it be a speacial occasoin or just a family night out. The food is always cooked to perfection and taste ever so good.,5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"We enjoyed our dinner.  The only negative is that there is not a bathroom on the floor of this restaurant, so you have to go upstairs.  There is a bar there, and the line for the ladies room was out the door.",3,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
Food was excellent and location important as near De Vos where we were seeing a show.,4,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"Great Food, Super sized sides. A little pricey though.",4,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Great value..best steakhouse in Grand Rapids,4,OpenTable Diner,Miami
"Our experience was very pleasant.  I thought it would be a little more expensive than it actually was.  We enjoyed our meal along with the atmosphere and staff. We enjoyed the menu with a good variety of foods from steaks to seafoods.  Overall, I thought it was an excellent dining experience.",4,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"The food was good, the server rushed by clearing and attempting to clear our table before we were finished.",4,DiningCustomer,Detroit
My wife and I have been going to Judson's for the last 3 years to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Each year the experience has been as great as the previous. I would recommend Judson's to any couple looking for a wonderful dinning experience.,5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
We had a great time at Judson's and plan on having dinner there again. WOuld highly recommend to everyone for a nice dinner out visit Judson's. Judson's is my wife's favorite resturant.,4,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"Friendly, attentive, and adaptable service.  I got the sense that couples don't ask to split a porterhouse there with any frequency, but our server arranged it for us without any fuss.  The escargots were delicious, and I liked that there were many options for the steaks: au poivre, oscar, bleu cheese, crab legs, lobster, et cetera.  Altogether, they deliver an entirely satisfactory steakhouse experience at a price point a notch or two below that of the Chop House. . . a good place for a good steak without breaking the bank.",3,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"We love Judson's and our waiter, Tim, was outstanding.  He is very fun and an excellent waiter.  Food is always perfect and he would do anything to make your experience fantastic.  We would recommend him and the restaurant to anyone.  We will request to have him as our waiter from now on.",5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"Wonderful overall, but the server was not that great! Although I did leave a $30.00 tip she could have came around more and been more friendly. Evan was a excellent assistant to her and hopefully he gets some of her tips. April I believe was her name!  Thank-you and I will be back shortly...",4,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Excellent service.  Was not that impressed with the standard menu but the daily specials were very interesting and all of us chose from them.  One order of mussels for three of us was plenty.  The only course that was simply pedestrian was the salads.  Very good wine list.,5,BillS,San Antonio
The food was not prepared well. I had veal and it was rubbery my friend had pork and it  was overcooked. Very disappointed.,3,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Great romantic dinner with delicious food! Service was wonderful!,5,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
"I love Downtown Grill.  Drinks are superb and the meal spectacular.    None of the entrees were disappointing from the salmon to the cowboy steaks.  Service is the best around.  Our server was attentive, patient, and had a great sense of humor.",5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
The chef is simply the best chef south of Atlanta.,5,DaveD,Oklahoma City
"I visited this restaurant while in town to visit family at Christmas. The hostess, Anna, gave great directions over the phone and when we arrived she ushered us to our table as well as 3 other guests who arrived a bit later. She represented the restaurant well and gave a pleasant start to the evening.   Our waiter, Adam, was FANTASTIC. His recommendations were spot on to the point that we just asked that he make most of the choices for us...IE ""Adam just bring me something good"" or ""just tell the bartender to mix me something unique"".  He provided gentle humor throughout the night and at other times when we were deep in conversation he would float unto and away from the table without us noticing he was there.  His recommendations were all delicious. The tuna and the mussel appetizers were devoured quickly. The filet with blue cheese and filet with shrimp scampi were slap ya mama good. And the orders of various chicken dishes were all great. The worst part of the meal is leaving the restaurant and realizing I may have to coordinate schedules to be sure I get the same waiter next time.",5,Glenn,Atlanta
I made a reservation for my teams holiday dinner. We waited an hour past the reservation time to be seated. They were out of baked potatoes and grit fritters. Our waiter did not introduce himself and the food was medicore. Very dissapointed.,2,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Restaurant smelled like old dirty ashtrays. Limited menu. Service was slow. Quality of food was overpriced. Scallops were very gritty.,3,Cher,Atlanta
Great ambiance and food!  Outstanding service and all around great evening!,5,MaryJane,London
We had not been to Downtown Grill since the decor had been renovated.  The new decor is very pleasing.  The food was very good as was the service.  The only reason that we don't go more is the fact that you have to navigate the cigar smoke in the front room to access the dining room.,4,OpenTable Diner,Savannah
Excellent food and server was great. Great resturant!,4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Took my wife for our anniversary date to Downtown Grill and was not disappointed. Cozy and romantic atmosphere with wonderful food. I had the aged ribeye, which was a special, and it was one of the best steaks I have ever eaten at a restaurant. My wife ordered the grilled chicken and it was melt in your mouth kind of good. I know as she let me try it. We both had grilled broccoli and the button mushrooms as our sides and were very pleased. The mushrooms were especially tasty. I am now looking to make reservations for a return trip so we can explore the menu and add this to our favorites.",5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Anniversary Dinner Wife Ordered Snapper only to be told later they had run out. Very disappointing,5,OpenTable Diner,Charleston
"Excellent as,always highly recommended",5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"The service was great. Our waiter had all of the specials memorized and was able to answer questions about every appetizer, entree, and dessert we had. The food from the menu was good but not necessarily up to its price. Had I let the waiter tell us the entree specials I have no doubt it would have been amazing. The tables are a little close if you’re trying to have a romantic evening because the parties around us were quite loud...I’d like more seclusion for special occasions. There were a few ceiling tiles damaged and light fixtures missing that need attention and take away from the overall ambience of the restaurant. Overall I thought it was a nice change from the chain restaurants and would recommend it to others. 4 our of 5 stars.",4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"I always enjoy my night out and amazing service and delicious food at Downtown Grill!!! Great date location, business meeting spot or just everyday dining😁",5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
In town for business. This place was recommended by a friend. Food was delicious. I ordered the blackened fresh catch of the day. Cocktails were delicious. Server was very knowledgeable and super friendly. The only negative was the seating was to tight for 5 individuals. Other than that is was a great meal.,4,Khud79,Dallas
"Being new to middle Georgia, this will surely become one of my wife and I’s go-to places - without question. I was excited to see and enjoy some of the wonderful whiskey selection and we both enjoyed our meals.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
We had a great experience at Downtown Grill. Awesome atmosphere with great food and outstanding service. We highly recommend this restaurant for all occasions. We look forward to dining again soon.,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"It was awesome as usual, the food was delicious and the service was great!!",5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"We make it a plan to stop here every time we go through Macon, GA. Really good food at great prices",5,DrOliver,Birmingham
The food was delicious. We had the seared tuna app and it was awesome. The steak was cooked a perfect medium. The fish diablo was amazing. Our waiter was superb. The silk pie was  the bomb. Our drinks were perfect. We wanted to enjoy a stogie but no one to help us the bartender was away for awhile so we left. Great ambiance.,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"The food was great and so was the service. The feel is of old town upscale dining. Very Nice. The specials are always great and they can accommodate special request. Our second time here recently. The only drawback is that you have to enter and leave through the bar which is a smoking area. We usually take my mother with us and she is very sensitive to smoke. If there are several people smoking at the tables that you walk by, this can be a problem.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Overall was a nice time. I would rate as fourth amoung Grand Rapids area steakhouses I have experienced. Red's on the river, Chophouse, and Loius Benton being the top three.",3,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
We celebrated my daughter's 30th birthday at Judson's.  We had superb service and the food was the best we've had (all five agreed)at any fine restaurant!  We would definitely choose Judson's again for an evening out or special occasion.,5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"Nice place for dinner for 2 or 20.  Service was great!  Ala Carte menu was a tish pricey for the area, but the food was great and plentiful for the price.  Portions on sides are enough for 2 people.  Wish it was connected to the skyway.",4,LisaP,Detroit
We had a table for 5 that was very good.  Plenty of room nice experience.  Felt that the wait staff was hurrying us through the meal. Otherwise a good experience.,3,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Wine by the glass list left a lot to be desired.,3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Nice restaurant with great service. Everybody was helpful and friendly. Our server, Steve was friendly, knowledgeable and made our experience a great one. The only downside was that the temeprature of my food was a little cold.",4,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"On this occassion our service was very poor.  While seated in a timely manner for our 6:00 reservation, drink orders weren't taken for nearly 15 minutes.  On more than one occassion we had to ask where our server was to order another drink and to inquire about when our food would be served.  Our steaks and salmon were served cool not warm.  We would have returned them but the service was so slow (we did not receive our entrees until 7:40) and we had tickets to a concert that started at 8:00.  Obviously there was no time for after dinner coffee or dessert.   We've been to Judson's before when service and food were much better.  For the price, however, I will hesitate before I choose it again.",2,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"We have enjoyed dining at Judson's several times and were totally satisfied with the food, service and ambiance.  We live 40 miles away and try to dine at Judson's when we come to Grand Rapids for an event.  We will definitely eat there again and have recommended it to friends.",4,Trish,Detroit
"The waitress was very knowledgeable and made some nice recommendations.  We appreciated the great service, Thank You!!",3,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"Service was very good. The table setting was very formal, which is what we wanted. Food was a generous portion and excellent. All special requests were honored. Good experience.",4,undum7577,Detroit
Thank you for making my birthday amazing!,4,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"Entrees were quite good.  Sides came luke warm.  Service was far below what this sort of facility should provide.  Food took over an hour to arrive.  Either kitchen wes understaffed or wait staff was streched too thin.  All polite, but a very long evening mostly waiting for food and even drink refills.  AA",2,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"The service was friendly, but extremely slow.",4,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
First impression was nose full of cigar smoke. Why the cigar bar is first thing you smell/see  is crazy. You wait for table in smoked full room.  Get past that section and rest is good.   Food was good and so was service.    Be a top notch place if they get rid if smoking area.,4,Chez,Philadelphia
"Stopped here on our way to Atlanta.  Great ambience, great food, would definitely go back.",5,OpenTable Diner,Adelaide / SA
"Overall the dining experience was good, but because of the smoking bar bar you had to walk threw we almost left before being seated because the harable cigarette oder , it took our breath. Fortunately the dining room was free of that oder so we stayed.  We probably will not go back because of this.",4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Made a special day even better. Loved celebrating our engagement and never felt rushed,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"We had a night out and enjoyed our dinner very much; service was great, food was delicious! We had a steak and fish--both exquisite! We'll definitely be back!",5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Started poorly; had to walk through cigarette smoke in the bar to get to our table. Same thing to leave. Very annoying and disappointing.  Steaks were great. But not great enough to walk through cigarette smoke to enjoy.,4,CHCannondale,Washington DC
Never disappoints and always feel welcome.  I enjoy bringing out of town business guests here.  Richie always makes his way to make sure nothing less than fab is being served.,5,JohnCato,Atlanta
Service and food was excellent.  This is the best steak house in middle Georgia.,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"It is a great, intimate hole in the wall. Perfect date night spot. Excellent food and great drink selections.",5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
The downtown grill is the best steak house in Macon.  The menu is very balanced so if you are not into steak be sure to try the pasta all the food especially deserts are very good.,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Highly recommended for its steak but mine was a disappointment. Too tough and over cooked. My wife enjoyed her meal though so overall it was ok. Cool place and lively atmosphere,4,Ross,Las Vegas
"Fantastic service. Food was great; although the salmon was slightly more cooked than I prefer, the sauce brought the dish back to one I will definitely be back for. Absolutely a restaurant I'll recommend.",4,Josh,Atlanta
"It was hard to find, but well worth the search. We will be back.",5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Everything was great about this place. Bar is energetic if you're in to that; dining area is quiet (which I enjoy). Service excellent. I highly recommend the blue cheese or the goat cheese stuffed filets. Mussels are a great appetizer. Price is up there, of course, but definitely worth it.",5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Went for daughters 21st birthday and 6 of her fellow Geico interns. Wine menu great. Our experience from drinks to dinner (too full to try dessert) was excellent. Everyone tried something different and preparation was amazing. Blake, our server, was phenomenal!!!  Only critique, we did not get briefed on what was on cheese board (which was excellent) and bread 🍞 service tad slow (but absolutely fresh. Finding was bit challenging too but we will be back!",5,MonaG,Atlanta
"Our food and room were exceptional. The main problem we had was the service. There weren't enough wait staff our night. We waited over an hour for our drink order to be delivered. Our appetizers were a little after that. We arrived at 7 and weren't finished eating until 10. Luckily, we were all local people, and know the reputation of Downtown Grill. Our waitress was apologizing the whole night. I don't feel it was her fault.  I will return as I hope this was just an unusual circumstance.",4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Nice atmosphere, great food, and good value. Waiter was helpful and attentive.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Disappointing menu. Too few side options. Potatoes were hard. Steaks are way over-priced. Can definitely get a much better steak meal in GR for the price.,1,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
We were hoping for a great meal on our evening out. Our bill  was over 160.00 plus and the food wasn't any better then Apples Bee. For the cost we would have been much better going to Roth Chris. My steak came out like it had been blow torched. I have never seen a steak that looked like charcoal lump  and the sliced potato's were uncooked.,3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Steaks were over priced $42-45. No side included. No baked potato on menu. Everything alacarte.  Won't begoing back.,2,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
There were four of us and we had three of the specialty steaks.  No one was willing to try and finish the 16oz steak.  They were cook perfectly and delicious.  Will definitely be going back!,5,OpenTable Diner,Minneapolis
"Business meal following a long day at a tradeshow. Warm comfortable atmosphere, great service and great steaks.  Mix fantastic martinis. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to unwind while talking business .",5,PJMac,Minneapolis
Unfortunately 2 of our steaks were charred badly and had to be sent back.  I am actually surprised those were sent out and not caught at the pass.  The other couple we were with were done eating well before us.  The food is generally good when it is prepared correctly and not tasting of char.,3,Steadycash,Detroit
Excellent food and service. From the wedge salad to the scallop appetizer to the stuffed filet and perfectly cooked asparagus - it was great,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Before dining I read the reviews! most we're very good but they all specified slow, poor service and excellent food! I thought  it could not be that bad! Well it was worse! We waited at the maitre d s for 15 minutes for our table and there were 8 empty tables already . ! we sat down and then waited 10 minutes for a waiter to take drink order! So we immediately ordered our entire meal! as we had a previous commitment in an hour and 15 minutes1 so we then waited 15 more minutes for our drink order, 2 beers and they arrived after our salads! dinner then arrived exactly 1 hour after ordered and we never saw a waiter again to replace our drinks until the maincourse arrived. !!  So the food was excellent but how many complaints are necessary before you change the floor stafff and managers!!",3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
We ordered steak and chicken and the Portions were very small,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
We totally enjoyed our experience and love the food and the service but I found it to be a little noisy but that was probably because it was so full,5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
The service was great and the food was delicious. We celebrated our engagement here and had a great time. The wine was great and our server was always checking up on us making sure we were doing alright. A little bit pricey but for a celebration it was well worth it.,5,ConG,Grand Rapids
First time this past Friday. The server was fantastic. She asked what out plans were after dinner and made sure to adjust the service accordingly. Had the surf and turf that was on special. Steak was perfectly cooked and tastefully seasoned. Shrimp was cooked to perfection. Potatoes were flavorful. Overall we had a great experience that rivaled other top steakhouses in the city.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Wonderful place for our anniversary dinner. We found this restaurant during Restaurant Week several years ago when we traveled to Grand Rapids to celebrate our engagement. We make a trip back (from Indiana) on the same anniversary/birthday weekend to celebrate almost every year. A few years ago on someone's suggestion we changed restaurants and we were very disappointed, back to Judson's we went! This is our kind place. It is in a convenient location, the seating is such that you can have quiet conversation, the service is top notch, and the food is to excellent. We are somewhat simple eaters, so the French Onion Soup, New York Strip, asparagus, Brussel sprouts,  BIG loaded baked potato, and vanilla cheese cake are our go to choices. The portions are huge and everything was cooked to our specifications. We cannot wait to come back again. Also thank you to our waiter Tim (we highly suggest asking for Tim to serve you) for making our evening spectacular.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Service was terrible, waited fifteen minutes to get our drink order.  Food was not as good as in the past, steak very gristly and potatoes were burned.",3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids

Outstanding!,5,Luv2dineout,Grand Rapids
"Great service, food and atmosphere.  Highly recommend.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Disappointed with service.  Not extremely  crowded, but waiter was delayed at the beginning.  Also during the meal.  Hostess had to take our drink orders. Craft beer was slow in delivery and not very cold.  Had a discount e-mail and informed waiter at time of order and were thanked for giving the information.  When bill arrived the offer was not reflected. Had to bring it to his attention.  Probably will not return for sometime.  Food was quite good and well presented.",2,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
I thought the food was way over priced for what it was.  I wouldn't go back for that reason alone.  You were as much as Capital Grill and that place is way nicer.,3,OpenTable Diner,Memphis
We had been there many times in the past; maybe this was just a bad night.   Ordered the fish special and it was dry/over cooked.  Service was not the norm either.,3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids

"We had a 50% off coupon and thought we couldn't possibly be disappointed with the value.  It was not adequate.  My husband's $88 bone-in rib-eye was not nearly worth the value.  It was fatty and at least a third inedible.  We frequent fine dining all over and the steak was not even close to what we would expect and have had value from places such as Ruth's Chris or Chop House at a comparable price.  My 6 x $5 per shrimp (I ordered 6) were awful.  My husband ate 1, begrudgingly, and I had 2 and left the other 3 becasue I ran out of enough lemon to render the 2 I had edible becasue they tasted so fishy.  When the  server offered to clear the plate I said ""take it"" and mentioned that the shrimp was fishy.  He cleared it after asking for clarification of what I said, and that was that. We have a 25% coupon left and  agree that it is definitely not worth returning for.  Sad commentary.  No reason to return.",2,foody,Grand Rapids
Nice referral to an area we were unfamiliar with.  Good food and atmosphere.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Enjoyed my birthday dinner!  Like the atmosphere, great food, outstanding service. Never had a bad experience at Judson's.",5,shoppro,Grand Rapids
I go there for the tenderloin which is great. In general food is tasty and portions are sensable. Ambiance and decor is enjoyable.,4,Roballo,Grand Rapids
We spent our anniversary here.  Food is very good and my filet was excellent.  Everything is a la carte.  Prices are not cheap but food quality helps bridge some of that gap.,4,Gingerdea,Grand Rapids
The Delmonico Steak was the best I have ever eaten!!! Just amazing!!,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
The waiter at Judson's was very knowledgeable and attentive.  The steaks were delicious and the brussel sprouts are worth getting as well.,5,power2b,Grand Rapids
"We were celebrating our anniversary with friends, I have a gluten problem and the waiter Santo steered me in the right direction.  In fact I could eat any of the desserts so he sub a dessert for me and was so attentive and thoughtful.  He is a valuable person to your restuarant.  We will come back again had a very good experience.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Great place for dinner before a concert at the Arena!,5,Luv2dineout,Grand Rapids
"Best meal and service I have had in a very long time. Came at the suggestion of a coworker and was very, very satisfied!",5,BrandonB,Grand Rapids
The food was awesome we had very good service it's a great place to go for a special occasion. But it's very disappointing how far you have to walk to use the restroom especially in a restaurant of that caliber.,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"We went for our wedding anniversary and had a wonderful time.  Our waiter Tim was fantastic and the food was great.  The soft lighting and quiet atmosphere was perfect for our night out.  I have to also compliment their bartender who mixed up 2 martinis that fit the tastes I was looking for to a ""T"".",5,KatrinaC,Grand Rapids
"Fine steakhouse. Great food, wine list and knowledgable staff.",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Best place for steak that we know of.  Service is top-notch. Plenty to do after dinner in the many venues available nearby.,5,redmeatluvr,Grand Rapids
"Steak and salad. A great cube of well aged strip topped with a mushroom and pearl onion ragout served over garlicky mashed potatoes. One served a perfect medium, the second ok medium rare ( could have been handled a bit  more gently to avoid the well to medium edges) No complaining though, the meat was delicious. And one might think lettuce had no new twists. Both the wedge and caesar had tasteful twist. I especially like the maple bacon and  roquefort dressing on the wedge, while the caesar was topped with tasty parmesan crisps.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"As a steak restaurant this place falls between the mass steak places like Outback and the real steak places like Chop House and Ruth's Chris.  Unfortunately, the prices are in the upper range rather than lower range making this a poor choice unless really pressed for a table (which there were plenty available as I think we were one of perhaps 3 or 4 tables that night).  Quality of the steak was not any better than what could have done at home - not sure it was even Prime grade.  Overall, plan ahead and get reservations at a real steak restaurant",3,Cyclescott,Grand Rapids
Food was excellent and service matched it.  Highly recommend for any occasion or just a night out to talk!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"tim and Mandy excellent people and servers.  Keep them, hard to find these talented people.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"My out of town client's like your place but the service has much to be desired!  The biggest problems are that the wait staff forgets your requests,  says inappropriate things and sometimes downright insulting things.  If it were not for my client's I would be done with you.  Seriously unimpressed!",2,Jere,Grand Rapids
"Went for Art Prize, nice to sit down, great staff, quiet, clean and prices were very reasonable for the quality and quantity!",5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"We love Judson's.  They have great food with great service - oftentimes, we can find one but not the both combined at the same restaurant.  I highly recommend this restaurant for a fantastic meal.  We look forward to the next time we are in town to eat there again.",5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"Rated a bit down on service only because our meals were somewhat slow coming out of the kitchen tonight.  However, it was worth the wait.  Everyone noted that their food was exceptional.",5,BrianL,Detroit
"This was my first time to Judsons and I wasn't disappointed.  The service and food was delicious, really hit the spot!",5,OpenTable Diner,Denver
"Tim took care of us the best he could. My hangar steak was over cooked (they made it right tho)... my wife's sirloin was good. Service was slow. There wasn't much interest in doing anything for us after the steak mistake - I had to ask for it.   In the end, we had an ok meal in a restaurant that seems to have lost its way. I would have appreciated some proactive planning for our anniversary since I shared comments as such in my reservation.   Oh well. No reason to go back I guess.",2,MaxG,Grand Rapids
"We asked for our steak medium rare, and it came to the table prepared medium.  We sent that steak back for a new one.. 20 minutes later that one came out prepared  Medium.  We had a concert to attend so we didn't have  Time for a third try.  The manager did take the steak off our bill which was only fair.   When your restaurant is named with Steakhouse in it you better know how to cook it!!  The service was fine as well as the manager.  We were here 3 years ago for our anniversary, and that meal was outstanding along with the service.",2,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
We went out for restaurant week and we had an amazing time. Will definitely be returning!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids

"Went for steak dinner.   Food was excellent.   Service was good.    Steak melts in your mouth. I would definitely go there again.   Also loved the building it was in, The BOB.   Lots to do after dinner.",5,OpenTable Diner,Toledo
Excellent!  My meal was perfect but husband's a little stingy on the scallops. ONLY TWO!!,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"We all ordered from the Restaurant Week menu, and it was superb.  Everything was perfectly prepared and delicious.",5,GrandHavenFoodie,Detroit
"Went to Judsons for Restaurant Week with friends and was underwhelmed with our meals. Portions were very small. The plum salad could have used a bit of sweetness. While the 2 small lamb chops were tasty, the frisée served with it was like eating another salad. Would have preferred something hot, perhaps a starch. Dessert was good but again pretty tiny.  Friends who had the steak had tiny potatoes and small pieces of broccoli. Those who ordered scalllops had 2 on their plate. We certainly weren't full when we left  and didn't feel our meals were worth what we paid. No reason to rush back to Judsons.",3,CinZ,Chicago
Great night celebrating our first anniversary our waiter was the best giving us fantastic recommendations. The food was also great did the 3 course menu which was well worth the value.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Always have a meal at Judson's on every trip to Grand Rapids, never disappointed! Love their steaks, their French Onion Soup and their wait staff!",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"The food was good.  It wasn't hot but warm. I had steak and vegetables, the vegetables was hotter than the steak.   A friend and I went for Restaurant week and it was my second time at this restaurant.  I may try it again but won't be in a big hurry to go back any time soon.",3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
The food was delicious! Our waiter was excellent and very helpful in explaining food selections to us! We loved the Signature Bacon Wrapped Stuffed Filet Mignon and the  Au Gratin Potatoes! We also had a sweet potato-type of dessert that was incredible!,5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"The BOB is an interesting building, when we ask for a good steak place, Judsons was recommended.  The service was great,  willing to make menu changes to meet dietary needs. The food was excellent and vibe was interesting.  I would recommend it for any meal.",4,OpenTable Diner,Pittsburgh
"Nice, elegant but a bit relaxed. The service was excellent. The food, delicious. Check out their signature dishes such as the Brussels sprouts and the bacon wrapped filet. Our server suggested the perfect wine for pairing. We'll be back.",5,cjhenner,Detroit
"Food was disappointing and expensive!!! Our server was very nice, ambiance was average- would not go again",2,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Disappointed with quality of the food &amp; portion relative to the cost. It was an $80-90 meal for my wife and myself with one beer, one salad (shared) and two dinners. Expected very good or excellent steak and it was just good.",3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Very disappointing.  Have gone there a couple times a year for 10 years.  Menu is pared down/changed.   Prices are up.  Service was very slow and they seemed understaffed.  Too bad. Was my favorite steakhouse in Grand Rapids at one time.,2,OpenTable Diner,Miami
"The server was outstanding, with knowledge to recommend.  We were not rushed. The food was well prepared.  My wife and I had the higher priced food and were not disappointed.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
50% off got us in.  we usually only top end dine out for a b'day or other special ocasion,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Excellent food, although the service was a little slow. Our waitress was very nice, but she was busy so we ended up waiting a little longer for our check than we would have liked. But we loved (as always) the brussel sprouts appetizer, the arugula salad special, and the finger steaks special. And the biera misu (not sure how to spell) dessert was the best chocolate dessert we've had in a long time. We'll be back.",4,Ohiogirl,Detroit
"Food was good, service was outstanding! Nice to see the menu had a 'refresh'.",3,shoppro,Grand Rapids
Delicious food and great service. Will definitely be back.,5,NicoleG,Detroit
"Still one of our favorite places for a special dinner, the recent remodeling has also resulted in significant menu changes.  Gone are: small portion of brussel sprouts, baked potatoes and",4,Maculman,Detroit
"Great steak, best in Grand Rapids in my opinion. Great Creekstone options and the appetizers and sides are also delicious. Must try the Brussels sprouts if you go as this is one of the few restaurants I have been to that can actually make them properly. One of the best restaurants in Grand Rapids.",5,UAGR,Grand Rapids
"Initial service was good . Server very knowledgeable about menu, apps were great but wife's main course was greatly undercooked, when it came back second time still undercooked and the outside was burnt but good. My meal on the other hand was great so not sure what happened . Will probably give them another shot at a future date. The manager did comp us for the entree",3,Rcoo,Grand Rapids
Fantastic dining experience at Judson's. We love the new menu and the service by Tim was outstanding.,5,OpenTable Diner,Minneapolis
"When I choose to dine at a what appears to be a finer establishment the last thing I want to find is someone with a gross piece of metal hanging off their nose bringing me drinks.  Judson's might as well call themselves a cafe.  I promised my Grandmother a fine evening on the town.  I ever imagined I'd be so embarrassed.  I asked the manager, Vance, if there was a policy about this sort of thing.  He replied, 'No.'  I will not bring a business associate, in-laws, or anyone else I wish to impress to Judson's.",3,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
The food was really good and it is a nice place.  They must have been having an off night because the service was really slow.,3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids

Great service:),5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Enjoyed the service and great food,4,OpenTable Diner,Denver
"Another excellent experience. We were not able to secure our preferred server (Tim) but the server who looked after our needs did a splendid job. We continue to be impressed with the menu and the preparation of the items--always delicious and artfully presented. I am a stickler for details and knocked my Overall Rating down one notch because my cocktail (a Negroni) lacked two elements that it normally has: 1) an orange peel garnish (this is mandatory), and 2) the beautiful single block of crystal clear ice (this time it was built with crushed ice and, though  clear as can be, was a little bit of a letdown). Judson's is more of a special occasion restaurant for us, but we almost always leaving wondering, ""Why don't we come here more often?"" We'll need to get into the habit of doing just that; this place is a gem.",4,jsbach2306,Northern MI
The food service and atmosphere were terrific.   We chose the restaurant to have steak.  My NY strip was prepared perfectly and it was delicious.  Portions were more than enough yet not obscene.  Our server was professional and engaging.   He balanced fun food discussion with with just enough privacy.   Overall the reataurant gets an A!,5,evand,Grand Rapids
"Great Steakhouse ~  excellent steak, would have liked a side included with our meal rather than ala carte, especially considering the price of the entree. Subdued atmosphere nice for conversations. Terrific service! Also enjoyed their desserts!",4,ClaudiaB,Grand Rapids
"Our server was on-the-spot with service and recommendations. Knew the menu inside and out, down to the ingredients. The Filet was incredible. The crab appetizer was also very good.   Save room for dessert - the chocolate cake will feed your table.",5,RichS,Denver
One of the better steaks in town. Especially when they do their 2 for 1 deals,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"The service was great. Our waitress was helpful, knowledgeable and friendly. The food was fantastic.",5,BrentM,Grand Rapids
The wait staff and food were terrific! The vegetables were so flavorful. Almost the best part of the meal.,5,deborahs,Grand Rapids
"Our  favorite restaurant, Judson's, let us down.  We've always had top notch experiences in the 10+ years we've been going  for special occasions like birthday's and anniversaries.  On our waiter's recommendation, I ordered the block steak, which was very tough and not worth the asking price of $30.  The other let down was our waiter was too chatty for our tastes.  Nice guy, but talked way too much.  We have not given up on Judson's and will try again and hope for a better experience.",4,Maculman,Detroit
"Hostess was never at the stand. Hadtofindher,then she was unfriendly food wasfine, unmemorable",1,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
At 6:30pm on a Saturday night they ran out of several of their entree selections which was disappointing.,2,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
My only complaint was my steak was overcooked. I asked for it MR and it was MW. Manager talked to us and took care of the issue.,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"its ok,,, for the price... but not outstanding, for the price...",3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
We have been here a few times before so we know what to expect with the cost but it still is very pricey. I don't like that you don't get anything with the meat that everything is a la cart. Waiter was very slow but luckily we were not in a hurry.,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"We had a good meal at Judsons at the BOB.  Our steaks and seafood was cooked just right.   We waited for a long time to get our appetizers which was the recommended bruschetta  and then within a minute our main course arrived, so they had to take our main courses back to the kitchen and keep them warm.  The wait person apologized for that, but stated she had put the order in right after we placed it and there should not have been such a wait.  It was her second night there and we thought she did very good.   We weren't very impressed with the managers on duty that night.   We saw the food at Gillys before we went over to Judsons and in hind sight would have preferred to have eaten there.   Prices were better, food looked great and service was excellent at the bar.",3,bpatters1950,Baltimore
Both my wife and I ordered steak and we shared two sides (a la carte). The tenderloin was perfect with the house steak sauce. The ambiance was classy and we had a wonderful time.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Food was awesome! The appetizer portions on the small size.  It was noted on the “open table” reservation, a special occasion, would have been nice if our waiter had been informed. The birthday girl did get a candle on her dessert, nice touch.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Great atmosphere! I have lived in Grand Rapids for almost 6 years and never heard about this gem of a restaurant until recently. All I can say is that I have missed a lot over the years! The service was wonderful and the food was great; the staff were very friendly and helpful. I also liked the fact that the tables were not very close together, allowing for more space and a very comfortable dining experience. It is going to be my preferred place for serious steak from now on! I highly recommend it.",5,mgmgriggs,Grand Rapids
We have eaten at Judson's many times. It is our favorite steakhouse in Grand Rapids.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"We had dinner before a concert last week. Fantastic food, fantastic service, and fantastic location. I highly recommend.",5,SteakLover,Salt Lake City
"Our server Tim set the tone by suggesting the bartender create a cocktail based on information he elicited from me. It was spot on delicious blend, so the second one was a no-brainer.  We shared crab cake appetizer. It was delicious, crispy on the outside and done just right. Husband had a generous portion of salmon off the featured menu. I had the beef tenderloin. Both were done to perfection. Tenderloin was melt in your mouth tender.  We shared individual portions of Brussels sprouts and green beans. Both were tasty blends. So tasty we took the leftover veges home.  I'd highly recommend this place for a special occasion.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Steaks are excellent! For the price of the food the ambiance and vibe was poor. Did not feel like we were at a steakhouse.,2,OpenTable Diner,New England
"My wife had a steak that was slightly burnt, risotto was undercooked . The place itself needs to be remodeled. Starting to look very dated",3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Food was amazing!  Had stuffed filet as well as roasted brussel sprouts.  Service was great!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"The people are amazing and the service was wonderful. The Caesar salad was good - too many olives, and honestly I'm not sure why someone would put olives on a Caesar to begin with, but that's my personal preference I suppose. The quality of food was very disappointing. They call themselves a ""steakhouse"" yet there are maybe 4 choices of steak on the menu, all of which are terribly overpriced. For a $50 steak I expect something that rivals Chop House or Ruth's Chris since the price is the same, but honestly we felt like we paid Chop House prices for Applebee's-quality beef.",2,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Although the staff was of high quality, the experience was short of a true Chicago steak house.",3,OpenTable Diner,Richmond

"everything was amazing! We had the best crab cakes ever! The Michigan watercress salad was excellent, I love the seed brittle.  Dinner was top of the line!  Excellent wine and the lemon cello was a lovely after dinner drink. We will definitely be back!!!",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids

Special occasion for my wife's birthday.  Very nice atmosphere!     Service was very slow and not to our needs     Good arrived steak was not even cooked.  Server was no were to be found while my wife ate her food.    :30 later he stopped by to see if we would like dessert .  Never checked back once the food  arrived     Very disappointed,3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids

"Judson's is a great spot in a great location.  The BOB is a terrific venue and located in the midst of so much to do both in the ""Big Old Building"" and the surrounding area.  A good selection of fine food with a solid wine list or selection of other nice beverages... ;-)  Definitely worth going to for a nice dinner or a quick stop in the bar for appetizers and beverages prior to an event in The BOB or at the Van Andel Arena across the street.",5,FordLake,Grand Rapids
Brought my daughters for a nice downtown dinner.  Food was excellent and the service better than that. One of my favorites for a great steak and entrees with a little creativity.,5,MisterQ,Grand Rapids
"We got to the restaurant and were told to wait a moment while the hostess walked off. She came back and looked our reservation and brought us to our table. The waitress for the table next to us dropped a drink all over the floor and had to pick it up. She was embarrassed and because of it we waited quite a while for our drinks. The food was good but not as good as other restaurants around for the price. I don't think I would go back or suggest it to friends. It was not a bad experience, but definitely not worth the money for us.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"All of our meals were fantastic. Hats off to the chef, as there were great gluten free choices to accommodate my allergies and Celiac Disease.",5,PattiS,Grand Rapids
Had excellent service and great food! Nice spot for a special occasion.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"My girlfriend and I came here for our 7 year anniversary based off a recommendation from a friend, and it did not disappoint. The bacon-wrapped stuffed filet was phenomenal, as were the creamed vegetables. Tommy was our waiter and he did a fantastic job of adding to the experience of Judson's. He was very knowledgeable and engaging while allowing us enough space to enjoy the occasion we were celebrating. I would not only recommend Judson's to a friend, but I would recommend they ask for Tommy as well.",5,TheBistroMaster,Milwaukee

"Fantastic service!! Delmonico, potatoes and greens were delicious! Duck app is highly recommended!",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"We have eaten here many times, and this last time was a very busy Saturday evening in the BOB during the Irish Fest on 3-18.  The service was extremely slow,  from the moment we sat down.   Desert never showed up (we canceled it after 25 min.)  All in all, it was an hour and 45 minute meal, and we had ordered right away when the drinks were delivered. We are chalking this up to being an off night at one of our favorites and will still return. The food is worth it, and the service was friendly, just maybe understaffed that night.",3,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
The food is very good and cooked just how you want it. The meal is spaced out so you are not rushed. Excellent service and atmosphere is quiet enough to have a good conversation.,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Everything for our special occasion reservation was outstanding. Sam, our waitress, was impeccable, the food was delicious and one of the best things was how our group of 6 could actually hear each other talking! Even though the restaurant was busy, the noise level was so low that we commented on it multiple times how enjoyable it was.  Thank you for a great experience.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Things ran a bit slow Saturday night. I realize that influenza and norovirus are prevalent in GR currently, so due to illness Judson's may have been short on staff. That being said, we ordered a salad that never made it onto the bill much less the table, and service was slow. The food and drinks were nice, but I was hoping to be wowed a bit more for the price of the meal.",3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Overall we had a good experience.  The table next to us had a drunk guest which we wish the staff would have addressed.  Swearing and commenting on women made it an uncomfortable experience.  Our waiter was fantastic.  Food was good, however a little pricey for what you get.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Food was very disappointing as all the veggies tasted like they hadn't been washed and we hardly cooked and still hard. Steak was well cooked, potatoes were disappointing like the veggies - very limited menu not many options.",3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids

"Went to Judson's for Date night, my husband loved his New York Strip, would've liked another potato option. My lamb was yummy too. Service was good. timely with personality",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Awesome waitress. Food was great but VERY expensive.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
The server (Santo) was great and the food was excellent. The portions were not small as some of the reviews stated and we chose to go with the lamb maybe a little over done for me but the flavor was awesome and salmon plate was to die for and my girlfriend loved it for her Birthday dinner! we started with the wild mushroom brochette and I would highly recommend it but it is filling. The highlight of the night was the cheesecake I wish I knew the name of but it was Oreo Carmel Moka something and it was the best my girlfriend and have ever had so thank you! Oh yeah after eating it and telling our server Santo how much we loved it he proceeded to tell us how happy he was that we enjoyed being it was a third generation Italian recipe that his great grandmother passed down and he made it! I guess he does other desserts on the weekends for the restaurant to offer! Over all great experience and enjoyed being treated so well!,5,bturner,Grand Rapids
Great dining experience good food servers were awsome food was alittle pricey for the portions.,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Ordered split Ceasar salad and I was hardly big enough to split. Ordered Delmonico steak $45 to split , came just warm not even hot. Sauce for the top was actually COLD. Asked for sautéed mushrooms and they had to go back and cook them. We added salt they had zero flavor. Left without desert. Is not the same as a few years ago when we came. Prob won't be back .",2,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"The filet was outstanding!  The brussel sprouts so good I think my kids would eat them. The server ( Steve ) was charming, knowledgeable, and polite. The timing of dishes and drink was impeccable.  The atmosphere puts you in a relaxing mood and melts all worry.  I felt more comfortable than I do at home. I ate, felt like, and was treated like a king. Thank you Steve and Judson's!  I will be back!",5,StevieD,Grand Rapids
"Jusdon's, while very beautiful, was disappointing and underwhelming. The 'shareables', which were described by the waiter as 'for the table' were extremely small portions. For example, we ordered the crab cakes, and while delicious, it was clear that there was only enough food for 2, not the table of 4 we had. Our entrees were delicious, but for the price, were underwhelming. As for the staff, our waiter, while friendly, was inattentive and didn't seem to take it seriously that we were trying to speed through dinner as we had other engagements to get to.   Overall, it's an impressive place for a date or a special occasion, but for getting together with friends for dinner, I'd recommend going elsewhere.",3,Guppypuppy,Grand Rapids
Great service and flavor - YUM.  The environment was very comforting and a great time to spend with friends and family - with laughter and great food.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Quality of food is reliably good. Steaks are cooked as ordered and are tasty. New menu selection is good. Room may become noisy if there are tables with larger groups celebrating something.,4,Roballo,Grand Rapids
New menu is disappointing. What happened to the great less than talked about steakhouse alternatives in Grand Rapids. Pick one thing and do it well.,3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
This was my first time to Judson's and my husbands second (it has been 10 years though). We got right in and seated.  The hostess was friendly and our server was great.  She knew the menu and was happy to explain any items that we had questions on.  The food was outstanding and ticket to table time was just right.   My only tiny complaint is that we lost our server for a short period of time towards the end of dinner (needed a refill on drinks) but it really was not a big problem.  I would definitely recommend Judson's for a great dinner and evening out.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Very good experience.  Waitor was excellent.  Couple of large tables made the noise level higher.  Love the food and atmosphere.,4,dojogolfer,Grand Rapids
The meat was excellent here as is to be expected by a steakhouse of this caliber. The sides however did not measure up to the expectations held at this price point. Overall the service was great.,3,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Great food and great service! Our server was very attentive and the food was prepared just as we ordered.,5,PeggyK,Detroit
Consistently great food and service in a wonderful old timber and brick historical building. Judson's is located within the BOB in  downtown Grand Rapids.  Their steaks are great. My favorite is the Delmonico. The rest of the menu is very creative and tasty. This is a can't miss spot.,5,OpenTable Diner,Orange County
I've had great service and food in the restaurant in the past.  potentially due to holidays service was understaffed and or we just ended up with a waitress that was not the best.  Food was still very good.,3,badservice,Grand Rapids
"Hearing that Judson's was remodeling soon, we dined there between Christmas and New Year's Eve.  Judson's is our favorite restaurant and our experience this time did not disappoint.  We both had the stuffed filet mignon, with my wife choosing a side of brussel sprouts and I opted for the au gratin potatoes. Both sides were excellent.  Waiter Tommy was respectful of our space and not innterruptive.  He was also very helpful in choosing the right wine.  Overall, the experience was on a par with the quality we have come to expect from a Gilmore Restaurant.   We hope they don't make too many radical  changes at Judson's.",5,Maculman,Detroit
"Menu confusing.  ""Special"" was bait and switch...NOT APPRECIATED!!  On line no mention of $20. ceiling on second meal.   One steak had to be sent back, near raw.  Second time around, about the same.  This is a mere shadow of what use to be a good steak restaurant. Don't waste your money.",2,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
I want to cry when a $45 steak is over cooked... The bartender was as always fabulous.,3,OpenTable Diner,Milwaukee
"Steaks were overcooked and over priced. Too many other great steak houses in GRR to settle. What a shame, it used to be so great. Still love the setting and location.",3,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"Promised that we would have plenty of time and still be on time for our concert. ..once we finally received our food, had to hurry through it in order to make the start of the performance.  Did not have time to relax and enjoy the good food.",4,CJoI,Detroit
"Not the restaurant that it used to be. Steak was overdone( they did comp the steak), portion of sides was extremely small for price , and service time was extremely slow. Hour and half to get our food. Way better options in GR for steak!",2,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Being our first time  we were thoroughly  happy with  everything this restaurant  had to offer.  Our waiter, Steven, was a delight, answering  all our questions  and making suggestions .  Our food was delicious  and plentiful .",5,Mick,Chicago
"Our meal was fabulous and our server, Santo, was very attentive and personable. We will definitely go there again.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"They got rid of the bacon wrapped scallops!  I can't imagine what they were thinking.  I am not likely to return for a while, as this place is one of about a dozen decent steakhouses within a short walk from downtown.  BRING BACK THE BACON WRAPPED SCALLOPS!!!",4,PnCKevin,Grand Rapids
This was our first time there and we loved it!  The food was delicious.  The service was great.  I would definitely recommend eating here.  We were a group of six and are already talking about going back.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
We were cared for from arrival to exit.  Food was spectacular and presentation was held at a premium.,5,KyleM,Dined 5 days ago
The service was good. The food was delicious. The restaurant had a nice atmosphere. Parking was easy to find. I would recommend going for a special occasion. It's a bit pricey but not as bad as I thought it would be and definitely worth it.,5,KDMA,Dined 5 days ago
"Several of us (5 out of 6) had the Beef Brisket Bourguignonne and, although tasty, it just wasn't the same as the last time we were in.  The brisket was tender and flavorful but lacked the baby carrots and mini potatoes as last time which made it much more appealing; a great blend of rustic flavor and vegetables. This time, there was only thin slivers of potato and mushroom so we felt like we were just eating meat.  And, in one portion, there was a big glob of fat.  But other than that, martinis were good.",4,SueH,Dined 7 days ago
"Atmosphere was excellent, service was great, people were friendly and everyone seemed to help out each other. Food could have been better, I had the duck ravioli and the amount of duck in each piece was quite small.  When I cut it in half, it was a challenge to get duck in each half.  There really wasn't as sauce for it except oil used to cook veggies. My date had the risotto and it wasn't cooked properly.  Needed a little more absorption of chicken stock to make it not so firm.  I wasn't done all of the way. Wine was great but expensive.",4,JohnW,"Dined on February 3, 2018"
"Came her last Saturday. Server was super helpful on deciding the menu. Wasn’t very knowledge on specials, had to read off menu. But food was amazing per usual so we always come back for big dinner dates",4,OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 2, 2018"
"Food and service were good.  Waitstaff friendly, knowledgeable and willing to learn.  Red wine by the glass was MUCH TOO WARM.  Whites were fine.",4,Spot,Grand Rapids
"We went for my wife's birthday.  The food was excellent  as was the service.  We went on a Saturday evening, so it was fairly crowded and loud.  If you dine here on the weekend, I would recommend reserving a table.  I thought it was a little expensive for the portions, but not too pricey.",3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"The ambiance inside the restaurant is wonderful. It’s not to stuffy and very relaxed, but you always get great service and amazing food. We started with the charcuterie plate and it was delicious as always. The bread is wonderful. I had the spinach bucatini and all the flavors melted together perfectly. He had the beef brisket and it was so tender and flavorful. For dessert we have the chocolate gateau, it wasn’t too sweet but it was full of chocolate flavor. Overall we had a wonderful time and I know we will return.",5,Sabrina22,Detroit
"Incredible food! The cheese plate, the Michigan pork chop, and the saffron risotto were all outstanding.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"We were visiting in GR this past weekend and looking for an Italian restaurant. Booked a table here and we were seated promptly on arrival. Our server Blaze was attentive but kind of meek . My husband ordered rustic pizza and I had the Rigatoni which was a little salty for my liking and we ordered two beers. Not thrilled about the quality and quantity of food for what we paid. We probably will not visit again when in GR as by time we paid  valet and dinner and tip it was really not worth it for a little pasta, a small pizza and two beers. While it was not terrible, it was disappointing.",3,RDH99,Detroit
"Great food, great service, friendly bartenders.  Will definitely be back!",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Great food...decent portions. Our waiter Ryan our waiter was very helpful and encouraged asking any questions about the menu. We never felt rushed. Very pleased with our experience.,5,Dunegirl53,Detroit

"Restraunt is one of my favorites - great food however, our waitress was a bit snarky and it is always so loud, which makes having conversations difficult",4,Chicojo,Las Vegas
"Date night!  We love them as they are few and far between now with our schedules and the seldom “kid free nights” we experience.  Downtown Grand Rapids has sooooo many choices for good dining that it has become difficult narrowing the choices down. This week I received an email about live jazz music and I jumped on it immediately; we love the ambiance of live music that still allows you to carry on a quiet romantic conversation too.  We were not disappointed. Bistro Bella Vita has always been our go to place for martinis; it is hard to beat their consistency and value.  As a result we normally only have appetizers with our drinks. Tonite, we decided upon full meals because the music was so good; we were not disappointed!  It was excellent. My fiancé had a North African vegetarian dish and I had the brisket. After two appetizers though (one on the house!) we ended up bringing home 1/2 our meals!  We will definitely put BBV on our go to list again!",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Great job with the food as it was awesome!  Service was great!,4,JohnG,Grand Rapids

Great food and great service.  I would definitely recommend Bistro to anyone looking for a nice dinner.,5,Dtwo,Grand Rapids
"This is one of my go-to restaurants for all occasions, whether drinks and appetizers at the bar, a business lunch, or great dinner. The decor is upscale and the restroom is lovely. The cocktail list has lots of fun options.  Service is perfect, not pushy but well-timed and thoughtful.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Great food and service    Gave us plenty of time  to talk before ordering. $3 off drinks until 6!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Best steak I’ve ever had!!! It was Cooke perfect and I was upset when it was gone!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
We got a gift card here for Christmas - best gift I received hands down. We 10/10 would recommend this place for anyone. It is a little pricy but worth the price. Best meal I’ve had.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Took my girlfriend here for New Years Eve and we were very impressed with everything from the food and seating to the waitstaff service. Our waiter was very helpful,  we had a reservation and were immediately seated when we arrived. The food was delicious and all the ingredients tasted fresh. Definitely plan on going back and I have already recommended the restaurant to some of my friends and family. We parked right across the street at Ellis Parking, the restaurant also offered a valet service but I’m not sure if that’s available every night or if it was a special occasion for the holiday.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids

We had a great visit to Bistro! Restaurant was not busy and we were seated right away. Started with drinks and bread course and it was delicious. Our food was great - love their daily rotation menu. I ordered the goat cheese ravioli which I typically order and would highly recommend it!,5,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
It was a great and delicious dining experience. I highly recommend this place.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Bistro Bella Vita has always been fantastic and this time it didn't disappoint in the least. The food is always to die for no matter what I order and the service is top notch - paying attention to what you're there for and making menu suggestions. I ordered something completely out of the norm for me and was nervous, but of course, it was stellar. Not to mention that their heat went out that day and they called to tell all of their evening reservations so they weren't surprised when they came in, despite the fact that they most likely lost business! Now that is how customer service should be done. Thanks for always being a reliable, credible and upscale choice in downtown GR.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Bistro Bella Vita has been a family favorite for what must be a least a couple of decades.  For us it is a destination event, we save it for special occasions and milestones but when we go, we go all out.  Even with high expectations and anticipation, we have never been disappointed.  Food quality, variety and presentation are consistently superb.  The staff and general ambiance are at a level well suited to our style and comfort level.  Over the years we have had many memorable evenings and look forward to returning to our favorite spot in the future.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Everything was amazing!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids

"Judson's Steakhouse in the ""Big Old Building"" (BOB) in Grand Rapids was an exceptional dining experience.  My filet was superb and it was one of the best meals I've had while dining out.  I definitely recommend it.",5,Theatrejrc,Cleveland
"Ordered their Cowboy Steak (24 Oz Ribeye) cooked medium rare.  This was a $68 steak, which they had avery limited quantity of.  It came out way over done, medium well to we'll done.  Needless to say, at that price, I expect it to be right.  Staff and management didn't hesitate to offer me the LAST one, cooked properly.  Several staff, management, and the chef were very apologetic, as this was also our anniversary date.  Second steak was perfect, and they topped it off with a complimentary bottle of wine and dessert for each of us.  We were comped nearly $125 off dinner.  Much of it was unnecessary, however, greatly appreciated.  They kept my business with their friendly, generous staff, and desire to make things right without the slightest hesitation.",4,OpenTable Diner,Nashville
We celebrated our 25th anniversary at Judson's.  It's a smaller venue which I loved all the attention we received.  The scallops were DELICIOUS and the steaks DEVINE.,5,Candi,Chicago

"Judson's is a local favorite for obvious reason. Excellent steaks, amazing service, and a fantastic overall experience. Highly recommended but make sure you know it's on the higher end of pricing. Worth it.",4,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Dined here prior to Janet Jackson concert and was first time at this restaurant.  When eating at a Steakhouse Thanks!   The steak is best to order but wasn't in mood for steak this evening.   Chose the Duck and the pork chop.  Both were fabulous.  Perfectly prepared.   We split wedge salad and desert.  Waiter was fine with both and even split the wedge salad on different plates for us.   The Chocolate cake was to die for.  Will definitely dine here on next visit to Grand Rapids!  Waiter was first rate!,5,Afterthehorseshow,Indiana
"My parents, boyfriend and I went to Judson's for my dad's birthday. They were running their ""Hot Summer Nights"" deal, which meant 2 for 1 entrees! My boyfriend got the signature filet, my mom and I both got the regular filet, and my dad had the Alaskan salmon. We also split the bacon wrapped scallops appetizer, the roasted Brussels sprouts and the Gruyere truffled scalloped potatoes! Everything was amazing. Our server Leah was awesome,  giving suggestions and keeping our water glasses filled without hovering. I will definitely be back for another special occasion!",5,jeva106,Grand Rapids
"Excellent steaks in a comfortable atmosphere.  Also had a fig and prosciutto salad that was awesome.  Great service.  Could go dressy or casual, either is fine.  The prices make it great for a special night out, not an every day sort of place.  Highly recommend it.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Our group of 6 needed +1 added at the last minute which was done without a problem the hostess was fun and entertaining seated us right way! Our Server Trish aka ""Josh"" was wonderful the whole night!  She was attentive and responded to our request right away! The next time we go we will request ""Josh"" to be our server.  Thank you so much for making our night so great!",5,Dewy,Grand Rapids
"Judson's Steakhouse was inviting, relaxing, and unpretentious.  As first time diners our waiter was VERY helpful.  His expertise and knowledge steered us in the right direction as far as food, wine, and craft beer selection.  As celebrators of our 27th wedding anniversary, the managers surprised us with a slice of chocolate cake that was out of this world!",5,Bull,Grand Rapids

I enjoyed our dinner very much. Our wait staff was terrific and the presentation and taste of the food outstanding.,5,Flyer,New England
"Dinned as part of a Birthday celebration.  Our server was excellent, had a good grasp of the menu and made wonderful suggestions based on our conversation and likes.  He was attentive to our party without feeling like he was hovering.    Three people in the party ordered steak.  One medium rare, one medium, and one well done.  All were excellently prepared, tender, and juicy. even the well done steak (although lost a little moisture as expected but still tender and flavorful).  The fourth order was Salmon, which was cooked perfectly.  The side were excellent as well, with the loaded baked potato being the least specially (although huge) out of the four sides ordered.  Scalloped potatoes were unique and delightful, the Brussels sprouts just the right amount of sweetness in the maple syrup to compliment the vegetable.  The wedge salad's buttermilk bleu cheeese dressing completed the salad wonderfully.    Our only minor complaint was the volume level of the background music was a little loud.  Made carrying on a conversation a little harder than it needed to be.  Otherwise a wonderful dinning experience.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
The steaks are always perfect and the service is wonderful. Our go to spot for a special occasion.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Love the crabcakes!  The steaks were done to perfection.  Our waitress was very nice and paid extra attention and even made suggestions.,5,sparrowtoo,Detroit
"We were visiting for a wedding and wanted a good meal while we were in town. The Yelp review got us in the door, but the food and service will bring us back when we visit. Steve, our server, was flawless in menu knowledge and recommendations. The scalloped potatoes are the best at any major steakhouse I've visited. Great experience.",5,Scasox1212,Grand Rapids
Food great santo our server one of the best ever  as a retired orthopedic surgeon my wife and I have been to some of the best restaurants in the U.S. And in Europe. Santo is outstanding,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"We dined at Judson's May, 2015.  We walked in and honestly it is quite dated in appearance.  We were quickly seated and a waiter brought water and to let us know that our server would be there shortly, which she was.  A very nice young lady who took care of us and most of the rest or the restaurant.  I do not recommend the Escargot...not good at all!!  My date had a wonderful wedge salad though and I went for the Duck and Brussels sprouts both delicious and perfectly prepared. My date had a sirloin steak that was very good also. All in all a good meal !",3,Judsons,Grand Rapids
This is a nice place for a special occasion but just too pricey for everyday dining.  The menu does not offer many selections if you are not a red meat eater.   Wait staff very professional and atmosphere nice.,3,Spartan,Las Vegas
I had seen some good reviews for this restaurant.  We took an out of town business partner expecting it to be impressive.  It was not.  Food was good not wonderful.  Service was less than wonderful and it so  hot in there that we were sweating.  It was not very busy so perhaps others are experiencing the same.,3,MidwestTraveler,Grand Rapids
"Delicious fish and steaks. Sides of mashed potatoes, mushrooms, and salads were so tasty.  Great service.  Perfect place for a special occasion.",5,Christine,Detroit
"I have been to Judson's a number of times... and it is always outstanding food and great service.  This time the service was not as great unfortunately.  We had reservations for 6:15 and were not seated until 6:40.  They seemed a bit understaffed which was odd for a Friday night.  Overall it was great as usual and I would definitely go back and recommend it to anyone!!!   The stuff filet is amazing and so is the shrimp appetizer!!!  Thanks,  Phil",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"We went here for my husband's birthday. It had been a while since we have been out on a date. The food was Excellent! My husband ordered the Delmonico. It was cooked to perfection and very tender. Service started out great. The server was attentive and gave great recommendations. However, at the end of the meal it took 25 minutes from the time our table was cleared of dinner settings, to get dessert menus, order dessert and get the bill. We even received the bill with our dessert. I did enjoy the food but I value great service as well.",3,Ambo,Grand Rapids
"We have been to Judson's several times and it has always been excellent and consistent. If you are looking for a quieter evening, this is the place. We both had a steak and as always, done to perfection.   We find Judson's has an excellent wine list for me, and the best made Maker Mark and Ginger Ale for my husband. As he says; it doesn't have too much ice, and it has a generous pour of bourbon without being overwhelming. Excellent bar personnel.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"When I'm going to the Bob for dinner at 5:00pm with show after. I expect the valet to be running and available for use. I got there and nothing about valet or anything no signs nothing. I ended up dropping off my party who has difficulty walking long distances then had to go find a parking ramp then walk several blocks. When I got in and asked what happen to the valet they use to have. They were just like oh they must not be out there yet. Mind you this was probably one of the busiest weekends downtown. Laughfest and St. Pattys, come on The BOB get with the program and have valet out and available for the 5pm sitting for dinner at a high end restaurant like Judson.",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"It wasn't that busy. Truly it wasn't. We dined for our anniversary on Tuesday night. Our waiter never came by to the table til 10 minutes and never brought us additional drinks once ours were gone. I had to grab another waitress for help. When I did grab her, she had asked if we had gotten bread (no we hadn't) and went to get some. IT TOOK ONE HOUR TO GET OUR ENTREES! There were 2 of us! And it was a Tuesday night! Seriously?! Horrible experience. Our waiter didn't know what he was talking about and offered no suggestions off the menu. Oh, it was also our anniversary. Wish I would've spend my $125 somewhere else.",3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"We had the Delmonico, which was excellent, although a bit pricey. We had a nice dinner in a quiet environment, which is exactly what we wanted.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Always excellent service and food.  We eat here often with clients and vendors,  For me, its the best steak house value in town",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Living in Los Angeles, you become quite picky, especially in the smaller towns across the country.  Judson did not disappoint.  Santo was our server and was incredible!  His taste in wine exquisite and his food recommendations spot on.  It was truly a gem.  We had a reservation for 2, and were seated promptly.  Within 1 drink we had 4 others that wanted to join us.  Santo made it happen and the entire party walked away wanting to come back the next time we are in this city working.  I love finding real restaurants with real food and real wine when I have to travel to much smaller towns across the country!  BTW this place has a very cool vibe -- its located in what I believe is an old warehouse?  Its converted to several restaurants and bars -- Judsons  the one for the fine dining experience!  Thank you Santo!!!",5,Porschegirl,Los Angeles
We love celebrating birthdays and anniversaries at Judson's. The food is always top notch and the staff friendly. The new Wagyu steak had a heavenly flavor and even the lowly salad is special. This restaurant is one of the top two or three in Grand Rapids and I recommend it to all my friends.,5,Jerry,Detroit
"I have dined here with my fiance and now with a group of folks from work.  Both times we were treated equally well - true customer service.  Our waiter did a great job of guiding our group of 6 hungry dudes through our appetizers and sides to ensure everyone was satisfied and there was enough to go around.  He also knew the wine list and dinner menu rather well, which helped a couple of us decide what to order.  The steaks were phenomenal.  Overall, very good for a group as well.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Excellent food, especially scrumptious steaks. The waiter was very attentive and even brought us free dessert to share-their signature chocolate cake with ganache and chocolate curls. Everyone's food was prepared to their liking. Sides are served for 2 or family style. Scalloped potatoes were superb and asparagus was cooked perfectly and still a bit crunchy. Restaurant is in the BOB-- Big Old Building that features other restaurants and bars---a popular Grand Rapids night spot. Definitely worth checking out when you're in the area.",5,OreoOwner,Detroit
"Food was priced accordingly. Both of our entrees were prepared perfectly - rare was rare and medium was medium. Sides are a bit pricey, but expected in an upscale steak house. Our waiter was attentive without being annoying.  We did order a side of a bacon wrapped scallop and expected a wow. It was just a plain old bacon wrapped scallop.  Bacon held little flavor as compared to the taste of our steaks. The rest if our experience was great.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"I was very happy with my beef tenderloin served Oscar style with BIG chunks of crab! Husband enjoyed his steak au poive, served the best way with peppercorns encrusted on the meat. His favorite meal: red meat and red wine!",4,Obanski,Grand Rapids
"Judson's has a pleasant, friendly, warm atmosphere where people can actually have a conversation.  At the same time, it is a welcoming place for one person who just wants a good meal.  Ambiance is casual classy--that is, room and staff have class but diners will not feel underdressed in casual clothes.  The wonderful menu has a nice blend of price choices--from ""let's get a bite out"" to ""romantic anniversary dinner."" While it is a steakhouse in the best meaning of the word, there also are excellent seafood and other meat choices.  The Delmonico steak is my favorite, but the filet is special too.  I have enjoyed exceptional service at every visit.  (A notch above exceptional is Bruce.). Judson's is a little piece of heaven in a corner of the B.O.B.",5,PleasedPatron,Grand Rapids
"Judson’s actually does not come close to the steak houses around downtown Grand Rapids.  It lacks many things.  All of the above recommendations you ask your customers to select in their review; I could not find one that solidifies our dining experience.  The only one item that Judson’s has going for it, is the bacon wrapped filet - thats it.  If Judson’s is trying to NOT make this restaurant stand out, they’ve pinned it.   We weren’t even given a bread basket.  Only after our appetizer of 12 oysters did I ask the hostess if we were supposed to get bread during our meal.  She apologized and brought the bread to our table.  The waiter who was designated to our table apparently had too many tables.  We rarely saw him.  It was odd that his other table was situated clearly on the other side of the restaurant.   The Chop House, Louis Benton, Ruth Chris have panache, elegance, and an energized environment.  I didn’t get those feelings while dining at Judson’s.  I want that feeling that Judson’s appreciated that we chose them instead of the other steakhouses.  Instead, I get a feeling of “We’re just another table to wait on”.  I would rather pay the extra $20.00 at Ruth Chris to get those vibes. If it were my restaurant, I would try to cater to “walk-ins”, as getting into your restaurant without a reservation is almost impossible.  Maybe change your tables around to get more tables to accommodate the customer that doesn’t have the money for Ruth Chris.  I would also greet your customers with a variety of bread and butters once they situate themselves.  To make your restaurant more upbeat, maybe hire younger adults who need a paycheck.  Too bad you couldn’t put your bar in the middle of the restaurant on a riser/pedestal.  I feel the restaurant needs height.  Family style restaurants are all at eye level.  I hate family style restaurants.  If given the option to sit at a high top than in the dining room, I always choose a high top.  It makes me feel a bit better.",3,Renina,Detroit
"This was my first time to Judson's.  Overall a very nice experience.  If i were to suggest changes it would be for staff to check in a tad more. We both ordered medium steaks with some portion being medium rare and luke warm. The garlic mashed potatoes and honey glazed brussel sprouts were superb!  Over all, we will come back.",4,BMoran,Grand Rapids
Friendly staff.  Very nice atmosphere but not stuffy. Great location in city center.,4,Page5,Grand Rapids
"Had a reservation and had to wait quite a while to get our table. Then we waited 40 minutes for our salad course which was served about 1 minute before our main course. We asked what was happening a couple times and our server just lied to us, then the manager came by later and told the truth that our order got lost. He made a big deal about buying us desserts, and then brought out the wrong ones. Just a debacle. Food was decent.",3,R2cook,Detroit
"We had a group of about 9 people. Two people said their food was good, but one of those said her food was cold. My food was cold and burnt. I had to send it back. They did take it off of the bill. We were probably the only ones in the entire restaurant, yet we had to walk up to the bar to get refills of our drinks because our server took so long to come back. I've never really been a fan of TGI Fridays, but one of the people in the group made the suggestion. This has definitely confirmed for me that I will not be going to Friday's again. This seems to happen almost every time I go, no matter which location.",2,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
"Good food. Cold beers.  Don't really care when a hostess says, when leading us to the table.   ""If you want too, follow me"" . What's that all about?",3,KVee,Grand Rapids
The restaurant did not except my open table cupon for $50 and apparently was not one of the venues listed on line.  I'm not sure why I was able to book the table but not use the cupon.,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Not my favorite. Won't be back.,1,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Not exactly what I was expecting. I was hoping for a more romantic quiet setting. It was loud and not romantic at all. The food was good, but not worth the high price. I was quite disappointed overall!",2,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Service was excellent in every aspect. The service and food was amazing and the staff was very helpful with recommending things from the menu. Our wader knew the menu very well.,5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Great environment. Quiet but comfortable. Very friendly staff and a fantastic menu to choose from. A restaurant I keep coming back to. I've been a lot of nice restaurants in Grand Rapids and Bistro is still my number one choice.,5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
We love it....special and beautiful every time. Always impresses! Thanks!,5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"EXCELLENT FOOD ON CHEF SPECIAL PLATES. APETIZERS ARE AMAZING. STEAKS AND GENERAL mMEATS ARE OF GOOD QUALITY BUT NOT THE BEST. WINE LIST, WHISKEY LIST ( SINGLE MALT ), AND BAR IS VERY GOOD. tHE BARTENDER KNEW THINGS OTHER IN THE AREA DON'T EVEN HAVE IDEA OF. SERVICE IS OUTSTANDING AND THEY TRY TO MAKE YOU FEEL GREAT. OVERALL, A PLACE I'D LIKE TO RETURN WHEN IN GR. FOUR STARS.",4,drraffiq,Orlando
"No music on a friday night dinner, or at least too quiet to hear. Food was good, however, some of the flavors were over powering. Amazing drink menu/bar, and service was above average. Management, however, was non-existent.",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Truly outstanding food; excellent martini list of creative, new drinks. Very, very good service. Warm, welcoming staff. Only suggestion for dinner: table cloths.",4,TonyO,San Francisco
"We had a very enjoyable dinner New Year's Eve. Although very busy, the service was attentive and the food was served timely and hot. Both of our meals (two pasta dishes) were excellent. The martini menu was interesting. It is a noisy place when full as it was that evening. Watching the choreography of the staff in the open kitchen was fun. Seats were ready one half hour after reservation time, however it was NYE. Two dinners with a martini each was less than $70.00.",5,undum7577,Detroit
It was our first time dining at BBV and It was great food but the portions were small and the pricing was large. We were given a small two top table near the rail by the kitchen and ther was constant traffic past our table on both sides of us and many times people were waiting for seating and standing near the rail by our table. It was like having dinner in the median of a highway. Service was great and the waitress was friendly. It was very noisy in there and hard to have a conversation. Not the romantic new years eve dinner I had in mind. The food was tasty but not good enough to ever go back for.,2,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Great food and service. A fun find.,5,beckyis2,Indiana
"Our dinner was amazing! From the Calamari to the delicious bread and delightful dipping oil, to our entrees, drinks, dessert et all -- totally wonderful evening with great friends, family and amazing food!",5,LynnMarie,Detroit

"We had a group of 6 for dinner. From the start the meal was excellent. Apps were wonderful, our entrees were fantastic and the overall experience was superb. All the food was fresh and tasted wonderful.",5,OpenTable Diner,London
"A nice, reliable place with good, fresh food. Everything tasted great and appeared to be made on premises, just like the menu said. You have to study the menu to get the most out of this place. Many dishes are similar with what you would find in a upscale restaurant/bistro around town. Hidden here and there are authentic specialities with imaginative ingredients. We had the antipasti platter, which was really enough for four, then shared an excellent ravioli pasta for our first plate and then the pork scallopine as the second plate. You might pass that last one over, but I guarantee you won't find anything else like it around town. My only complaint is the wine list; hard to find a nice one under $40. Authentic Italian Dinner=$60+wine+tip.",4,BrainDad,Grand Rapids
We had a tight schedule and our waitress was most accomodating. Hostess was took time to greet us and provide comfortable seating.,4,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"We dine out for lunch and dinner nearly everyday, and have grown accustomed to mediocre heat 'n serve eateries staffed with poorly trained, non attentive personnel, no matter the price point, location, or reputation.  This establishment represents a departure.   From the cocktail list and wine list, thru the appetizers, entres and desserts, all that we ordered was top-notch and our service was attentive without being disruptive.  Just two days after our visit, we have already recommended this eatery to a handful of friends that dine out as much as we.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Bistro Bella Vita has a great atmosphere for any occasion, but especially for those romantic nights.  The food is always great there.  I would definitely recommend the Bistro to anyone and everyone.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The menu is focused on what is most fresh, and it is simple and brilliant.  The drink menu is terrific; I had no idea you could make a martini 40 different ways.",5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Wonderful food and service and will for sure be back to dine very soon!!!!!!!!,4,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
EXCELLENT!,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Great food &amp; service. Wonderful atmosphere.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
The atmosphere was very inviting and the food was delicious but slightly overpriced for the actual amount of food you receive.,3,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
The chef Patrick is a genius. The nightly specialsare great with local ingredients. Easily the best meal in GR!,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
This place is an amazing find. The food is grown locally and the service is great. I love it!,4,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"My husband and I were celebrating our 25th anniversary.  We were so well taken care of!  Our waiter, Michael, was very attentive and the manager stopped and brought us a special summer tomato salad on the house as a treat for our anniversary.  It was our first visit to the restaurant, but we can't wait to dine there again.",5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Hit the Bistro at the right time - before and after the fireworks for Celebration on the Grand.  Not terribly bust at all which meant that our waiter had time to be very attentive.  Great food and dessert.,4,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Bistro Bella Vita is our favorite restaurant in downtown Grand Rapids.  The food is excellent and the service is the highest quality I have ever encountered.  Great martini list as well!,5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
We were on our way to the Neil Diamond Concert and our wait staff was very respectful of our time constraints.  We got to the concert in plenty of time.  It was a perfect dinner and evening.,5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
We had excellent service. The food was great and the Martini's even better.,5,Luv2dineout,Grand Rapids
"Dishes were somewhat different conceptually but overall excellent. We will definitely be back, and are now happy to be able to recommend Bistro Bella Vita to others! Thanks.",4,OpenTable Diner,Shreveport
Great dinner before a concert or game at the VanAndel.,4,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
The use of local fresh produce and organic ingredients is fantastic!  The chefs can prepare meals as you like.  My favorite downtown Grand Rapids restaurant!,4,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"We eat at the Bistro fairly often, and we always enjoy the food.  The service can be hit or miss, but was good on this visit.  The dining room is seldom busy and there is a parking lot right across the street, making it a very convenient place to have a delicious meal downtown.",5,Paul,Grand Rapids
"I made reservations at Bistro Bella Vita because I had heard it was a great place to dine and a great location. I had a very important guest coming from 75 miles away and wanted to let him experience downtown Grand Rapids. We drove down to Bistro, fed the parking meter $3.00, only to discover when we got to the door that the restaraunt was closed. There was a sign on the door that said it was closed July 2nd for power outage. Nothing stating it was closed the third, and the lights were on in the restaraunt. I am extremely upset with the fact that no one at Bistro bothered to call me and let me know they were going to be closed. I sent them a message as well with no response as of yet. I had to rate everything as poor since I could not dine",1,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Mother's Day brunch with special menu. Very nice!,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"It is one my top favorite restaurants downtown GR. Everything is exceptional, food, service, wine list,cotail list, desserts. We were there for my daughters birthday and enjoed a very nice dinner. One of the hot spots for sure.",5,MimozaR,Northern MI
"Excellent food, service and location for pre or post Griffens night out.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Good carpaccio appetizer. Great mixed grill. Waygu and brisket, octopus and soft shell crap, another pasta entree. Tiramisu dessert also very good. Pour over coffee a disappointment as it doesn't remain hot long enough.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"The food was fabulous...perfection. Although the restaurant was packed, we never felt the least bit rushed. Our waitress was very kind and attentive.  Love this restaurant!",5,Judy,Chicago
"Very enjoyable dinner.  Fast, professional service.  Food tastes great.  Valet parking-for a fee-is a plus.",5,Mark,Grand Rapids
"My husband and I were really enjoyed our food. The service was great. The whole ambiance was a little odd. For the caliber of the food and price you pay it felt a little cramped, loud and bright. I guess we expected a more intimate ""bistro"" vibe. Our first impression based on the ambiance alone was so-so but the food and great service far outweighed that. Overall very happy with our experience.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Service was super fast, friendly, and efficient. Drinks were good, and imaginative. The food was mediocre, however; and not a lot of choices for those who do not eat beef or pork. Sauces were gloopy/muddy; not very refined. Dessert was meh.",4,Queenjan3,Detroit
We were all disappointed in our meal . My husband &amp;  our friends all got the Brisket Bourginone...it was dry ....a large portion but not much flavor. I ordered the filet &amp; it was prepared perfect but again not much flavor. We have been here before &amp; the food was so much better. Expensive meal for the quality.😕,2,Susiepearl,Hawaii
"Had to wait for drinks, they bought out our salads before drinks. Then served dinner and we had to wait for silverware.  Chicken pasta was not good.  Table in bar area was quieter than main dining room which was loud. Definitely not 4.6 stars this night.  Won't be going back for awhile",2,OpenTable Diner,Indiana
Loud at that time of day. Overall enjoyed the dining though,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"I didn't appreciate getting the worst table in the restaurant- next to the kitchen, facing a wall. I thought I'd get a better table having made a reservation in advance.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Great over all !,5,Slick,Detroit
Great atmosphere.  Went for a first date (!) and was quiet enough for nice conversation during the early  dinner hours.  Filled up fast after that and was a bit noisy but still a great atmosphere.  Nice selection of wines and different menu choices.  I'll be back!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
My favorite place downtown GR. Best martinis and food in town.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids

"Our go to place in Grand Rapids.  You can't go wrong.  Excellent daily specials, menu, drink menu, and ambiance.",5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
We had a wonderful experience and will definetly go here again!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"When we got there we were seated immediately. However, our waiter did not come over for 20 minutes.  Meanwhile the table next to us was seated, received their drinks and appetizers before anyone spoke to us.  Our food was good, not great, I had the ribeye and my fiance had the gnocchi.   Overall, I think it is a little pricey for what you are getting and would probably check out some other local places before coming back to this one.",3,tdeal92,Grand Rapids
Always an amazing place to have dinner and drinks. Couldn't ask for a better restaurant in GR.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"The Dilley's love Birsto and any of the EG Collection...

"Recently visited for a valentine's day meal, and loved it so much I went back for dinner when my dad came to town. Items on the menu run a spectrum of pricing, and even the top tier items (filet mignon), left me without a trace of diners remorse. Would recommend to treat yourself and yours!",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"We did enjoy our dinner for the most part, waitress was great! I had to change my reservation time from 8 to 8:30, I did so and received confirmation of this change. During dinner I got an email basically scolding me for missing my reservation and asking me to share ""what happened""  I didn't appreciate that.",4,OpenTable Diner,Milwaukee
Food is outstanding if you are willing to spend the money on an entree.  I had the salmon and roasted brussel sprouts.  Very good!,5,sparrowtoo,Detroit
"We had dinner with a party of four this past weekend. The restaurant had an extensive menu and everything we ordered was delicious! The rice in my paella was a little undercooked but the seafood was cooked perfectly. Someone else at our table ordered the beef brisket, which we all decided was our favorite dish out of what we all ordered. We'll definitely be back again!",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
My husband and I have celebrated our anniversary here for the last 6 years.  We also eat out here on other occasions with friends and family.  We have never been disappointed with the service or the food.  This place is a gem in Grand Rapids.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids

Always consistent and friendly!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids

She was very friendly and I would recommend her to anybody looking for an exceptional dining experience! The food was exquisite as it is every time I come to Bistro. I will definitely be back in the future.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Food and service was excellent. A little noisy, but it didn't seem to take away from the overall experience. Calamari is a highly recommended!",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"I have celiac and was told a dish was gluten free from the daily special. All of the ingredients weren't listed so I wasn't aware there was ground mustard which isn't GF except certain brands. I'm thinking it was the mustard sauce but there was another white sauce so maybe that was it. I really liked the restaurant and will come back, will not trust anything not labeled gf though.",3,OpenTable Diner,Hawaii
We were there for a business meeting and it worked out very well.  Our server was helpful and courteous and our meals were very good!,4,Chip77,Grand Rapids
Our favorite restaurant in Grand Rapids. Best calimari around. Magnificent duck ravioli and casoulet. Where else can you even get casoulet around here? Excellent knowledgable service.,5,Nlphd,Detroit

"We dine at Judson's for special occasions, especially our wedding anniversaries. We just celebrated our 45th anniversary and have every year here since Judson's opened. We plan to be back next year, probably many times. Fantastic food and great atmosphere with top notch service.",5,SouthpawSenior,Detroit
I give only a good rating because was expecting a better cut of meat for the price I paid,3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids

 We are not local to the area. Judson's was our pick from the internet while planning a weekend in town.  Waiter Tim was knowledgeable and very professional. The atmosphere was cozy. Food was great!,5,Foodfinder,Grand Rapids
"I  am a high school senior and took my date for homecoming.  Tim did not make us feel like a couple of kids and treated us to a dessert. I ordered an appetizer and dinner. I had the duck, which was AMAZING! If you ever make reservations-request Tim! Thank you so much!",5,Kyleswims,Grand Rapids
Judson's is one of the best restaurant's we've been to in a long time. The food was fabulous and the service was outstanding! We have never had a 2 pound piece of cake. That was crazy!,5,foodsnob,Detroit
Food is great! Service is always top notch as well.,5,PattiS,Grand Rapids
"For our daughter's 40th birthday, we chose Judson's Steakhouse, my husband's favorite downtown Grand Rapids restaurant.  We all enjoyed our entrees, duck breast, Delmonico steak and potato chip encrusted fish.  Since we were going to a symphony concert afterwards, we arrived early and service was friendly and speedy.  Great choice!",5,v68yum,Grand Rapids
"Excellent food and service, a combination that made our dining experience perfect.  Thank you!",5,Bonheur,Detroit
"My wife and I had dinner at Judson's and it was great, as always. Service was slow but that's understandable since it was the last weekend of the ArtPrize in GR.",5,kevster13,Detroit
"Judson's is located in the BOB(big ole' building)right across the street from the Courtyard Hotel and Van Andel Arena located. I have eaten there many times. Steaks are great and they also several seafood options available. While I miss Carl, the old bartender, our server was great. Great place to go for a nice dinner without blowing the bank like you might at Ruth's Chris or Chop House down the street.",5,Jtime,Grand Rapids
Everyone was friendly. Food was awesome. Had a great time.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"We dined here for the steak.  Found they only had a few steak entrees on the menu. I had the filet and it was perfectly grilled. Side of asparagus was under cooked and plain. The service was the bright spot. Our waiter was very friendly,  funny and attentive!!  Over all it was just a good experience.",3,Steakbuff,Northern MI
We went for a birthday dinner. Food and service was great as usual.,5,Tdula3,Grand Rapids

Our waitress was very kind and super helpful with her suggestions.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
We come to Judson's every year during Artprize. It's an oasis in the middle of everything and very good steaks and drinks and great service (which you might not expect during such a crazy weekend.,4,Jackieg303,Tampa
"So this was our second time in this restaurant. The waiter did not add to the experience. He is NOT an asset to the restaurant. Food was good, but not estupendas as the first time. We will try another time in the future.",3,Reallyhispanic,Grand Rapids
Tim was absolutely amazing. He described the menu items to us and he went above and beyond in making this a total experience instead of just a night out for dinner. The food was excellent!,5,fancyfoodie,Grand Rapids
This is our second time dining at Judson's. Both times were amazing. Our server was very personable and knowledgable of the menu.  Highly recommend dining here.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"We sat at our table for over 10 mins no one approached us, no one came to our table with water - not a waiter in sight so we left!  Never again - went to a place who wanted our money !",1,Mdspike,Chicago
"It has been a while since we ate there so thought it was time to give it a try.  The cost is equal to Ruth's Chris or the Chop House but the food falls short.  Our waiter did well enough, better than average.  They weren't very busy, understandably so.  They either have to get the prices down to the food quality or food quality up to the prices.",2,Longfellow,Grand Rapids
"I began visiting here in 2009.  I went once a week for 52 weeks.  My wife &amp; I brought our niece in 2012.  Then it was consistency from waiter's attentiveness to my martini bein filled to the brim.  This visit disappointed from the table initially offered--at the entrance--to presentation of our bill.  My wife ordered a particular single malt scotch and the bar was ""out.""  She ordered another Scotch, but only the most expensive version and my martini was a short poor.  My next martini was poured into the same glass--not a chilled glass The food was only good.  And our bill had my martinis and both Scotches, instead of the one my wife drank.  Poor attention to our table during the meal plus inattention to our bill.  It means we'll not return.",1,Rairoad,Baton Rouge
"We recently moved back to Michigan and prior to leaving we always enjoyed Judson Steak House. It was nice to see it is still a very nice restaurant with great food and service. Try the crab meat appetizer, the portion was plentiful and it was delicious. My husband and I both had a steak. It was done to perfection and the entire meal was very enjoyable",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Was impressed with the quantity of food, for a high end restaurant. Great service, and nice atmosphere. Would go back, without hesitation.",5,Sweeny,Raleigh
A+ across the board.  A++ if you get Tim as waiter!,5,CustomerExperience,Chicago
Food was burn't. The carpet was torn in several places.  For the amount of money you are paying should be a little nicer.,2,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
We have had the best Filet Mignon here three times now. Consistently good with excellent service people. Highly recommend it!,5,Skydancer,Grand Rapids
my wife and I dine for our anniversary dinner this week and had a wonderful time.the service was great the food was a great value and will definitely come back.,5,Scottsreviews,Detroit
My meal was wonderful.  Both my companion and I had steak's that were perfectly prepared and she is very high maintenance on the temperature of her beef preparation.  The cuts had wonderful flavor and the sides that we ordered were outstanding.  The potatoes with truffle oil were a great accompaniment for the beef and the caramelized brusel sprouts were excellent as well.  We also had asparagus that was that perfectly prepared and not overcooked like so many restaurants.  Delicious.  I was also excited to indulge in some fresh oysters as an appetizer.  I will be dining at Judson's again in the near future.  My,4,BillT,Grand Rapids
The service was excellent and food was good. There were 4 in our group and everyone enjoyed their meal. One person had the walleye and highly recommends this dish. There was A LOT of walleye on their plate!,4,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"Wife and I usually have steaks, but decided on the Walleye and the Ahi Tuna.  Both fantastic!!  Wine list is thorough without being overwhelming, and the value is exceptional for the quality of food.  Roughly 1/2 of what we paid at Ruth's Criss.",5,PnCKevin,Grand Rapids
"Thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience at Judson's. Food and service was top-notch. Best prime rib I've ever tasted. Pleasant atmosphere, multiple bars in same building for a one-stop entertainment experience.",5,redmeatluvr,Grand Rapids
We take our clients here. They/we love it. Try the French onion soup.,4,CustomerExperience,Chicago
"We hadn't dined at Judson's in perhaps a year or so and decided to make it the venue for our anniversary celebration. The service was attentive, not rushed, and the various bits of the meal left us in amazement. The French onion soup was a good recipe (too many chefs are heavy-handed with rosemary, but not this one) and the salad with avocado and rhubarb vinaigrette was inspirational. I ordered the tenderloin au poivre (tenderloin filets beg for added flavor) and was rewarded. The filet itself was almost freakishly tender. The Brussels sprouts were roasted and caramelized. It was exciting to find Brazin zinfandel on the menu. We finished with creme brulee that rivaled our own. We absolutely will return for dinner.",5,jsbach2306,Northern MI
Our food and service was excellent--- great experience!,5,luv2dine,Grand Rapids
"We had a nice booth in the main dining room.  Ordered a nice bottle of Chardonnay and apps. Shrimp cocktail, and fresh oysters on the half shell.  We ordered dinner, stuffed filet of beef and Halibat.  Marcie gave us outstanding service. Great meal.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Waitress was super slow and hardly came to our table. Food wasn’t anything special. Probably wouldn’t go back.,2,OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 2, 2018"
"It is a nice atmosphere, but the food and service were average for the price.  Cauliflower corn street tacos were fantastic, but the Hot Pot Shareable, and the Burnt Ends were way below par.",3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Disappointing...no longer the great seafood we came to appreciate from Gilly’s. Our table was not ready at our reservation time. The brisket on my taco had several pieces that were inedible—solid fat. The atmosphere—very loud. Service—marginal.  Again, disappointing overall.",2,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"We really liked the Poblano Corn bread, and the Cheese fondue. The burger topped with brisket hit the spot.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
This was our first time at Gilly’s and we were delighted. The atmosphere was cheerful and fun. Service was excellent - there instantly when we wanted and kind enough to grant us time to savor our drinks and meal at our rate. Amish chiciken and burger were excellent as was the broccoli salad.,5,Allergies,Chicago
Was disappointed at first that I wasn't going to get the crabcakes .  The smoked food was very good.  So I wasn't disappointed.,5,sparrowtoo,Detroit
Excellent overall experience.  Food was great and service was top notch.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Before concert meal, across street from the Van. Big concert crowd but reservation made for immediate seating. Good service, somewhat limited menu but food was very good. Nice selection of beers.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Gilly's food was great! We went right after a Christmas Bar Crawl, so we were bummed out they ran out of the beer we wanted. Overall, the food was delicious and the portions were huge!",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Great experience, however I was surprised that most of the waitstaff was unfamiliar with how to use the Gilmore App.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"The waiter, Colin, made the experience amazing.    You must like smoked food to appreciate this restaurant",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Great Service!! Was disappointed with a reservation that they stuck us in a super tiny booth that was very uncomfortable.  We had ordered the burnt ends and it was full of fat.,4,KP64,Detroit
"I must admit I was not impressed when my server returned to the table and told us they no longer had any smoked brisket.   This was 6:30 pm on a Saturday night! And they are a smoke house??? Well we had the port butt as a substitute and OMG it was FANTASTIC!  The staff was very apologetic and even gave us a $10 GIFT CARD as a condolence. So we are going back and looking forward to it! Thanks, Gilly's at The B.O.B.",5,Jonnyur2bad,Grand Rapids
The food was just ok. Not the best I’ve had but not the worst either. I had the chicken street tacos with a side of slaw. The side was literally the size of a silver dollar. There wasn’t anything here that I would come back for.,3,SJ1212,Grand Rapids
"Service was decent, my drink was strong and the food was tasty. We will definitely consider returning.  One thing, our appetizer (bacon fries) was cold when we got it. They were delicious but I'm sure they are even better served hot (or even warm). My husband will not return food to the kitchen so we just munched on them cold. Still,  a pleasant experience.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"The food here is good, but not gourmet-level.  The prices are very reasonable.  The location is perfect if you are in downtown for a concert.",4,Buccos815,Indiana
"We had dinner before heading to Dr. Grins. Food was very good. Service was very slow. Very loud inside, hard to have conversation with friends at the table.",3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids

"All the food was excellent!  There were so many items on the menu I wanted to try, so I'll have to go back.",5,Gorilla66,Grand Rapids
Great burnt ends and the bacon fries were unreal good!,5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"The food was outstanding, and so was the service. We got there in time to enjoy happy hour for a little while o the drinks were reasonably priced. The highlight for me was 1/2 price oysters; I had six, then I had six more! Then we split the gumbo dinner and still had a helping to take home! We will be going back for sure.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"We visited from out of town and picked Gilly's at random. They had just started a new menu that same day and it was amazing. It was the best corn bread we have ever had by far. The main courses were delicious also and very reasonably priced, the service was great and very friendly and prompt, and it was an overall great experience.",5,OpenTable Diner,New England
"We came here to celebrate my birthday and the food did not disappoint! The special was that my entree would be free if someone else in my group ordered an entree too. This is an especially great deal since I got the lobster thermidor! Everything tasted delicious, from the brussels sprouts, to the pacific rim nachos, to the steak burger. Their cocktail menu is also top-notch &amp; fairly priced, featuring the Gilmore Collection a Cocktail Competition Winner as a highlight. Our server was very nice, attentive, and helpful. Would definitely recommend.",5,Okpham,Detroit
"The food came out after almost an hour,  cold! Some of my party even had the wrong dish. The waiter decided that instead of fixing it he would argue with the whole table about it.   I asked for a manager.   The manager gave a free drink for my 30 dollar dinner being late, cold and completely over cooked.   Then I had to see another manager because the first one didn't even do what she said she would.   All-in-all It was an expensive mistake to go to Old Burdicks.",2,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"The food was excellent. The wait staff took a few extra minutes to greet us, but otherwise was on point the rest of the evening.  The restaurant itself is not noisy, but there is a bar (or 3) downstairs, and their music is pretty loud.  Definitely would go back!",4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Service was top notch( thxEmilee!), food was excellent...1 dozen oysters, Gumbo, Salmon, Brussel Sprouts, Wedge Salad, and French Onion soup...all great!",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"We enjoy the space and the food quality, but serving sizes seem to continue to get smaller and smaller.     We have been eating out here for many years, just seems the cost vs. the amount of food has really gotten to a point not sure we will go back, or at least not very often if we do.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"We travelled from Canada and went to Gillys which was conveniently right across from our hotel before going to see Red Hot Chili Peppers at the Van Andel and had the most lovely time, the meal and drinks were fantastic, our server, Lindsay was so nice, and the ambience was just so nice, the beer and cocktail selection couldn't have been any better, and would definitely recommend the Beer Cheese Fondue with pretzels for an appetizer, so good!",5,OpenTable Diner,Toronto
"Gilley is not like it was 10 years ago. It used to be fine dining, white table clothes and an excellent seafood menu and primo wait staff. Our water tipped over when u balanced table moved. Our waitress did not change the brown paper. Lobster thermidor was not eye appealing. Gravy and vegetables all one color and served lukewarm. Not a happy experience for my husband's Birthday.",1,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Food was good. Zach, our server, did a great job. 👍😎",5,NicNorth,Grand Rapids
"Unfortunately, the only part of my meal that was hot, was the mashed potato mound in the middle of the plate. The rest was barely lukewarm. The lobster tasted good, as did my husbands trout, but his food was not hot either.",2,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Pork sandwiches were tough and like eating an overdone porkchop in a bun. Run down atmosphere. Waiter - hard to get his attention. Very disappointing,2,OpenTable Diner,Miami
Oysters are always fresh and good! The corn  bread with the gumbo is amazing! The trout was a good preparation!,4,Etreair,Chicago
Dave my bartender was amazing as was the food and service. The hostess was a complete doll. I was just having dinner alone but they made me feel like I was in the company of friends,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Food was great, service was great--had free Lobster Thermidor dinner for my birthday.  Husband also ordered the same.  We both liked it.     The only negative comment is that we felt the manager was inappropriately dressed--she looked like she came right from working out at the gym to work.  Maybe it was odd dress up night (no one else was dressed like this), but she had leggings and a short midriff tee shirt showing her belly section with her tattoo.   I am not opposed to the tattoo just shocked that the overall outfit would be consider appropriate for her position--or for any public position for that matter at the restaurant.      Would still highly recommend going for your birthday dinner--or any special occasion.  It is a little loud and active, but it was Friday night.     Overall great treat!",4,Birthdaydiner,Grand Rapids
"Went for annual birthday lobster only to be VERY disappointed when pieces of lobster came out ""displayed"" in two half tail shells.  Was hardly a whole tail and no butter for dipping.  I could have make the mashed potatoes that came with it. Will never go back. This is what the BOB WEBSITE SAYS ""Get a free lobster dinner on your birthday at Gillys inside The B.O.B., featuring a 1.5 pound Maine Lobster dinner with sides."" VERY MISLEADING!!!",1,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"We looked forward to a good night out with family for awhile. We settled on Gillys, it's at the B.O.B.. Good time right? Service turned out to be the highlight. Our waitress was great! The food was mediocre at best, and way over-priced! We definitely won't be back!",2,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
We had a great time at Oyster Night at Gilly's! Food and service were great - I will definitely be back!,5,Marisa,New York Area
Our server wasn't attentive. Never came back for second drinks and then rushed us out. Manager doesn't know about restaurant discount cards. Not our best experience there.,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"The free birthday dinner was minimized to a split lobster with chunks of lobster in it.  We heard that you got a whole lobster.  When we got there (one hour drive) we found out it was the split lobster tail that they quit doing the whole lobster.  Everyone else's food was just ok.  My cooking is better :)  But, thank you for the free birthday meal.  The service was perfect and the atmosphere was very nice.  Give it a try, your taste in food surely is different than mine.",2,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"My fiance and I were out to celebrate and wanted oysters.  We were INCREDIBLY disappointed not only with the size, but the quality of the oysters for the price.  We ordered a dozen, paying $2.50 for each and couldn't have been less satisfied.  We left Gilly's, still hungry, and went to Charlie's Crab, where we got another dozen oysters for $2 each that were enormous, fresh and delicious.  We will not be returning to Gilly's again",2,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Service was poor, we finally received silverware about 10 minutes after we got our food. The order was incorrect and we were never offered refills on drinks.",2,Jennifer,Grand Rapids
"The service and atmosphere were fine, but the food wasn't the greatest this visit. We have had good food here before, though. Tacos were nothing to brag about and were served with a ton of tortilla chips. Apps were good. Grilled cheese brussel sprout sandwich was good, but super salty; almost to the point where I couldn't eat it. The salads were ok. The food could be so much better!",3,sgbs,Chicago
"""I love the relaxed feel of this place – like a comfortable dining room in a friends home. I definitely would return to try more dishes.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"We celebrated our 2nd wedding anniversary on Saturday the 6th and had an amazing time. The food was delicious, the dessert was better than I could have hoped for and the service we received was absolutely outstanding. We don’t get to go out often, being a foster family, so to have such a special occasion feel so special from our service there, we truly fell in love and will dine there when we get to go out again. Thank you staff, cook and management for making our evening so incredible and memorable.",5,CGarman,Grand Rapids
"This was a great place for a low-key dinner on New Years Day.  The food was great and our server was friendly and helpful.  However, our initial impression when we first arrived was NOT positive.  The young man at the greeters' desk was not friendly and did not look us in the eye.  He appeared to be more concerned in directing his co-workers around, than in interacting with us.  This is clearly a training issue which should be addressed.",4,OpenTable Diner,Western NC
Visited again for the wife’s birthday.  Fish and Chips were excellent.  Wife had a filet mignon and it was excellent also.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
We enjoyed our meal. Service was a little slow and server was not knowledgeable about beers. Overall good experience.,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Great evening! Wonderful food. Great service. Look forward to returning in the near future!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Need more wait staff.... we waited 15 min for waters and another 15 for drinks,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Our server Sean was Awesome 👏🏿. He was very attentive and he had an overall fantastic attitude. He anticipated our every need.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Great service from Ali. Food was not good. Pulled pork tasted like it was frozen and reheated. Jerk chicken  also was very rubbery. Wings were ok. Overall not a good experience and certainly not a good value.,1,OpenTable Diner,Washington DC
"Went to grab a quick bite before the Lewis Black show at the State Theatre.   You can take the headache out of trying to find a parking spot by parking in the ramp and take the walkway into the Radisson.  Personally, I like the bustle of the place.   Definitely not your average hotel bar.  Good craft beer selection on tap.   The service and food were both solid.    Very unique split screen TV area for big time sports watching.  I noticed the prices a bit higher than the same fare at other places, probably reflecting the fact that it is a hotel bar/restaurant.   But based on the overall experience it was worth it.",4,Hals,Chicago
"Great! Service was quick, food was great. We had a blast!",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Great atmosphere in Kalamazoo, we really enjoyed having lunch here on a WMU game day.  The sweet potato fries are excellent.",4,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"Service was fantastic, I ordered the New York Strip and it had a good flavor, but it was a bit undercooked and it really wasn't a fantastic cut of meat. All-in-all it was an enjoyable experience but some of the pricing on the menu items is a bit steep for the quality.",4,Jourdan,Grand Rapids
Stopped in for Kalamazoo Restaurant Week. Enjoyed the special menu.,3,JacquleneR,Grand Rapids
Great place to eat with large variety of food choices.  Best onion rings I've ever had. Best wings I have had as well. Meagan was a great server. So thanks to her we enjoyed the experience.,5,luv2oodine,Columbus
We always eat here when we come visit our daughter at school. Great menu with tons of choices. Burgers are amazing. Steaks are just as good.,5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"I brought a few colleagues in to Burdick's for a business lunch, and everything was spot on.  The host was all over knowing we requested a quiet spot to meet, and easily accommodated us when our party grew by one.  Food was fantastic as usual, and our server was on point with minimal interruptions, but still able to give us stellar service throughout our meeting.  Amberly is always amazing and greeted us with a warm smile!  Thanks for a great lunch experience, we'll be back!",5,Alexa,Grand Rapids
"A couple of our orders were made wrong and the food was served like warm. Fries tasted like they had been sitting for a while before served. The server was not very attentive or apologetic to the mistakes they made with our orders. It was a bit disappointing. I normally love burdicks, but this visit was not up to their normal standards!",3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Took the family to dinner for mothers day. The whole family enjoyed the dinner. We had good service. The food was great!,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Very nice mother's day brunch. They included a flower for the mothers.,4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
It was very busy and loud tonight. Service was really slow compared to other times we've been there. Food was delicious though.,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"We went here for Prom and the food was perfect, but the spacing was very narrow and crunched together, our waitress wasn't very polite, and we made reservations a week in advance and they sat us at a table that was 2 seats short, so we had to crunch together even more around the table. I was not very happy at all and it wasn't very comfortable. It would be great for a date night or anniversary dinner but don't waste your time coming here with a large group. Parking also sucks, but that was expected.",2,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids

Great experience. We will definitely be returning soon.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"We arrived earlier than our reservation but was able to be seated.  It was our anniversary so the staff greeted us and expressed congratulations to us.  We had a nice dinner and were staying at the Radisson, so it was nice to just return up to our room.  We also ate at the Burdicks breakfast buffet the next morning.  We actually had the same waitress and were wished a Happy Anniversary by staff again.  Very nice overall experience.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Tried the Siracusa fries, they were delishious. A nice counter point to my salmon BLT. The noise level was up the but not enough to discourage conversation at my table. Wait staff was helpful and quick.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"The food was good, but I missed the regular menu they normally have. They had a ""special"" menu for the valentine weekend. Service was a little slow but understandable for the valentines weekend.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Great ambiance and the food was delicious! I love the look of their bar, it's beautiful!",5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
The service was terrible. Waited an hour for our food and my burger was way undercooked,1,Playdohhhhhhhhh,Grand Rapids
We happened to be in during the last day of beer week and the first day of restaurant week so it was very busy. Luckily I made a reservation so we walked right in and were seated quickly. Service was very quick and the food was great! Will definitely be back.,5,Melanie1219,Grand Rapids
Food was excellent and service was awesome! They were very busy but still had great service. It was a bit loud sometimes to hear our conversations at times but we just talked louder.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Good food and service made this a great dining experience,5,OpenTable Diner,Cleveland
"Used to frequent Burdicks when I lived in the area 15 yrs ago.  Restaurant is just as good now, as it was then.    Made a reservation on line via ""Open Table"", and was happy to see the option for flowers delivered to the table. It was the wife's birthday and I was traveling in from out of state.  We arrived 20 minutes early, and table was ready, with the flowers on it.  Food was delicious and well prepared.  For an upscale restaurant the prices were reason and portions were pretty good sized.  Large beer menu of local and state wide breweries.  All and all a great experience and value.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Made a mistake on my reservation, we actually needed seating for 8, and the staff took care of us without any problem.  We were there for the Lions game telecast, and I am not sure if they changed the ability to have the main large screen as one, instead they had it segmented, into four screens.  That was my only disappointment as I really like it when they use the big screen.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Arrived a little late for our reservation, however we were still seated within 10 minutes of arriving and everyone was extremely helpful and kind to us. Wonderful service staff!",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
We had a fabulous experience and will definitely return.,5,OpenTable Diner,New Orleans
"Our waitress Ariella was wonderful. Her suggestions for food and drink were delicious. I would go again.  And,  I loved the table right next to the window for two. It was a perfect place to have a quiet anniversary dinner.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Lovely evening.  Attentive service.  Excellent meal.  Very positive experience.,5,lindasam,Detroit
"Food was delicious, service was impeccable! Definitely recommend.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Where the food was very good and presentation of the food amazing, the service was VERY slow and we even lost our waitress for +20 minutes when all water glasses were empty.  It was frustrating to eat our meal without any drink to accompany.  This was a 70th birthday dinner for my Mom and we chose the restaurant for ambiance and chef qualities but were very disappointed in the attentiveness of our server, and the quickness of the food delivery.  The appetizer came very quickly -then we waited over an hour to get French Onion soup and had to ask for our check before finishing the meal to make a concert at DeVos.  We had 2.25 hours planned for the meal and we should have had MORE than enough time.  It wasn't the special environment we had hoped and my Mom was super frustrated with how loud the music was in the dining area.  The bar area seemed to be hopping so I decided this is not a place to go for a quiet and elegant dinner.",3,Christine,Grand Rapids
"This was our first visit to Divani's , but it will certainly be the first of many! From a warm greeting at the door, to outstanding service (thank you, Jordan!), to out-of-this-world food, Divani's has climbed to the top 3 of my dining experiences. I cannot recommend this spot too highly!!",5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Enjoyed the atmosphere and food. Staff very friendly.,5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Good food.  We were celebrating a birthday and they went out of their way to help with that from greeting us to dessert.  Enjoyable evening with friends enhanced by the awesome wait staff.,5,Mike,Detroit
We had a nice girls night out.  Davini came highly recommended by a friend and it didn’t disappoint.  Loved the mushroom risotto!,4,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"Went as a couple and had the New Year's eve limited menu. Food tasted pretty good. Ordered a medium steak that likely sat for some time because it was somewhat dry. Received all courses after two couples that arrived after us, which ended being pretty slow service. French Onion soup was a bit too sweet but wasn't bad. I would recommend the place, but this wasn't our best experience here.",3,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Great food ! Limited menu for NYE but I’m happy to go back and taste the main menu,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Wonderful food in a cozy atmosphere! My steak was just plain awesome!!!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Went for an anniversary dinner after looking at many other options in GR. The ambiance was perfect for a romantic dinner and the food did not disappoint. The kitchen is entirely from scratch which is helpful for my vegan diet as they were able to easily modify some dishes to accommodate (wild mushroom risotto!). My husband had the short ribs and enjoyed them a lot. Staff was helpful, attentive and super friendly. Definitely recommend.",5,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
"First time here with friends for a Christmas get together. Nice atmosphere, good food and drinks. Would go again.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"The server was Lizzie and she was great, timing was perfect. The food was very well presented and cook to perfection. Great drinks.",5,Allen,Grand Rapids
"Great Service, pricey drinks, food is subpar for the price point (as compared to Ruth Kris / Chop House).  Great ambiance.",3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"We had a wonderful meal and the dessert, it was the bomb!",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Had the Divani burger. Good burger, would give it an 7 out of 10. Server was super nice and very helpful. Atmosphere was pleasant, but maybe a bit louder than normal as they were very busy due to a concert nearby that evening. The only disappointment was the cocktail I had.  Ordered a candied apple drink and what I got was a total miss. Didn't taste anything like the description in the menu. I honestly don't think the bartender knew how to make it and just faked it.",4,RJ125,Detroit
"Went for a special night on an overnight trip to the city. The food at Divani was really good, and the drinks even better. The two negatives involved being seated next to the busy servers station where they imputed orders into a computer, etc., and the restaurant being understaffed for a very busy Friday night. Our server was terrific, but clearly stretched too thin to be truly attentive.",3,OpenTable Diner,Birmingham
"Our server Jordon was excellent! We love the staff at Divani, and Jordon is fitting in well! The place is simply the best, and it all starts with management that cares, Molly and her crew go above and beyond, every time, to ensure excellence!",5,Moncu,Grand Rapids
"We went here for date night with a reservation, although it still took about twenty minutes for us to be seated. It was the night of a show in Van Andel, so it was quite busy. The dining is presented nicely, although not necessarily worth the prices. Generally a good experience, but nothing outstanding.",4,Ciar,Grand Rapids
Our wine selection really accented the entrees that were quite fabulous. One of our favorite spots in Grand Rapids,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Husband and Wife date night without the kids. Wonderful experience.  Service was engaging, prompt, professional, friendly. Charcuterie, burger, lasagne were all original and DELICIOUS!  Really, DELICIOUS!!  Spent 2 hours in pleasant conversation, nice drinks, delicious and interesting cuisine.",5,OpenTable Diner,Seattle
"Very nice atmosphere: classy, quiet enough to talk.  High quality food, with an extensive wine list for pairing options.  Our server was helpful and professional.  They even offered free sparkling wine toasts on Sweetest Day.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"I feel like this place is trying to be more than it is.  When you walk in , the decor is nice and room spacious, and we were expecting a high class dining experience.  However, the menu is somewhat limited and the choices we made were fair at best.  My guest had the squid ink pasta, which she deemd, ""OK""  I fared a little better with the lasagna, but just slightly.  We started with the calamari, which was flash fried, but seemed soggy rather than crisp.   We later found out, overhearing the server at a table near us, there was a special, which we weren't told about and it actually sounded interesting.  Sad we weren't told that be our server.",2,Sensational,New York Area
"Pleasant place, good food. I had the quinoa salad and the burguer. I could say that’s not ordinary. Great textures, amazing flavor.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"For a sophisticated and friendly environment, nothing much better than Bar Divani.",5,Hobbs,New York Area
"The service was fantastic not overbearing and the Chef Jeff's plated creations were beyond flavorful, they were passionate!",5,cynvin,Chicago
"Food has been superb every time I've been. Menu constantly changes to reflect foods that are in season. Love the creative cocktails, especially during happy hour when they're practically half price. Good ambiance for a date night.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Excellent service. Fabulous scallops.,5,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
"Very nice room our server,Ariana , was very attentive.  Charcuterie way beyond expectations",5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Great find. Loved the friendly staff. Food was excellent. Different drink choices a plus.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Our food was fabulous! There were eight of us and each of us ordered something different. No one was disappointed. I had the shrimp and grits which were outstanding. The service was friendly and paced our dining experience at just the right time. They were happy to accommodate serving a birthday cake brought in from a bakery.,5,Jill,Grand Rapids
"Pre concert dinner It was a little hard to find., but well worth the extra walk!  Nice ambience. Awesome friendly service by Annalise. The Bloody Mary was wonderful. I highly recommend the brisket burger. It was beyond fabulous!  I would return in a minute!",5,OpenTable Diner,Northern MI
First time in Grand Rapids but definitely not my last thanks to a great experience from start to finish! The food was amazing (probably the best crème brûlée I've had in life!). Highly recommend! Arielle was so helpful with selections from bottle of wine to appetizers to things to check out in town! See you in a couple months!,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"My husband and I love Divani! The atmosphere is upscale yet laid back, the service is wonderful, and the food is always great!",5,Susanna,Chicago
Amazing! Great birthday dinner with my lady!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"My husband and I recently ate at Divani for our first wedding anniversary and it was wonderful! The service was outstanding! Be prepared to spend a little more on your meal, however the food was amazing and it was worth every penny!",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Very attentive and knowledgeable wait staff made the tasty meal just that much more enjoyable.  Great variety of beverages, appetizers, and entrees.",5,Docdiner,Grand Rapids
"We had a wonderful evening at Divani during Restaurant Week Grand Rapids. We wanted to sit at the bar and the bartender was very friendly and appropriately accommodating. Highlights during dinner were the quinoa salad - so light, clean and crisp; the burger - the best we'd ever tasted - brisket roasted and then ground In-house - awesome texture &amp; flavor!; and the dark chocolate torte with raspberry purée - dense and drizzled with luscious berries.  The wine pairing with our meal was perfect. We especially loved the Pinot Noir by the glass.   This is a little gem of a place! Highly recommended!!",5,SallyZara,Detroit
The restaurant is wonderful. Our waitress was outstanding. We had 3 little kids and a baby and she was so attentive and helpful. Most our meals were delicious. The corn beef dinner we believe should have been more tender it would have been falling apart tender and was not. Wish they had real ketchup for the fries. But overall highly recommend Iron.,4,lasttime,Orlando
Friendly staff and the new menu is an improvement. We would come back to the IRON.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
We had good service.  However the appetizers for the price was not great.  The meat and cheese plate was over priced for what you got.,3,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
We were seated quickly and the service was very good.  We were close to the front door but not too close - but whenever the door opened we could feel the cold air come in.    Just wondering if there is a way to prevent that.  All was good and I would recommend the restaurant to others.,3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
It was a great experience.  The restaurant has a great style inside. Except for the strange scented candles that they had randomly throughout the place. They were all different and took a nice relaxing restaurant and kind of turned into a dorm room feeling.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Having heard a lot about Iron we were anxious to finally get there with some friends.  It certainly did not disappoint.   We had a few drinks in the bar pre-dinner.  The bartenders were friendly and fun.  The food was quite good and cooked to perfection.  We will definitely be coming back soon and often.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"We went to Iron for appetizers and drinks before a concert, and loved it!  Great food, service, and drinks.",5,OpenTable Diner,Washington DC
The tables are close together and several tables get a rush of cold air everytime the door opens.  Our server was friendly but kinda awkward on the times she chose to check on us. Food was good but a little pricey for what you get.  I would go back during the warmer months only.,3,RachD,Grand Rapids
"Restaurant was out of two entrees (walleye and pork),  chicken was too salty for my taste, nothing is served in iron skillets anymore, and menu seems much smaller than what shows online.  Thankfully the wine and company were excellent!  Probably will not return.",2,JilG,Grand Rapids
"Love the simplicity of this restaurant. The service was good - friendly and efficient. The timing of the food was off - took a short time for the appetizers and the dinners took a long time to come after that. We ordered the picnic and poutine - both very good. The porkchop was tasty, but very tough. Had a hard time cutting through with a steak knife. The sides were delicious and the bar menu was great. Two people in our party had the salmon - it looked delicious. Seared on the outside and medium in the middle. I was also under the impression that the food was SERVED in a CAST IRON SKILLET? I guess not. Not sure the connection between the name and the food. Also, had talked up a skillet macaroni and cheese but it wasn't on the menu. Hmmm...still good food. Will go back.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Our food was awesome, as was our service. I would recommend dining here when its a little warmer outside. With it being a smaller space and having 3 entrance doors, no matter where you sit (we were seated near a side door) any time a door opened we were blasted with super cold air. Our server brought me two mugs of warm water to hold:) which was great, but with warmer weather I think you'd be able to enjoy the actual dining experience a little more.",4,BrownMD,Grand Rapids
"Restaurant was ice cold.  Restaurant has a separate eating area for large parties but wait staff has to access this area by opening side doors, making their main restaurant ice cold.  Other parties had guest eating with stocking caps and mittens on.  As for the menu, the restaurant might want to invest in a computer printer. Every fish item has been replace with other offerings and the steak special was sold out.  2 members of our party, ordered the hanger steak, it was served cold and onion ring on top must have been cooked 2 hours before service.   The shrimp and grits were enjoyed by members of our party and their dish came out hot. Appreciated mangers attempt to make evening better by comping dessert. Apples in crisp were under cooked and dish had no flavor. Bread pudding and brownie was enjoyed by group.",2,BPS22,San Francisco
"Pretty good. Not a top downtown spot, but I'd try it again.",3,GRJules,Tahoe
"Great entree options and craft cocktails. Unfortunately, they were out of 2 of the entrees which only left a few options. We also order the dessert on special and had to send it back twice (two orders of it) because both times, both deserts were burnt. They did not charge us for the dessert, but was disappointed they didn’t offer a different dessert as well.",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Small space, cold in the winter months no matter how far from the door you are seated. There are several tacky space heaters positioned near the bar area, but that does little for the other tables. They were out of several specials (to be expected) but they were also out of several main entrees on the menu. They were also out of two or three different wines &amp; bubbly; it was NYE, but they should have planned accordingly. It seemed easier to ask “what aren’t you out of” when ordering. It took over an hour to get our mains. Water glasses sat empty far too long. The food we could actually order was subpar. The grilled cheese was extremely salty, &amp; the bread is crusted in cheese so it’s a little over the top. It might be good to share, but not as your full meal. We managed a $90 bill for two &amp; will spend our money on better food and better service somewhere else next time.",2,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Great dinner. Lots of options. Open Table gave us a 3:45 reservation although the restaurant didn't open until 4. They were confused. Meal was delicious, server was very attentive. Nice atmosphere.",5,MichaelM,Detroit
Christmas Eve- great food. Wonderful service!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Christmas Eve with family,5,samc,San Francisco
"They were out of at least 4 of the menu items. Food was so-so at best. Much better places in GR. Waiter was distracted and we had to remind him about our appetizers. Took a chance, oh well.",2,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Dined at IRON on Christmas Eve. Everything was perfect! Love this place.,5,shoppro,Grand Rapids
"Disappointed that our party of 4 reserved a high top via Open Table (it makes you choose table type for this restaurant) and got seated at a low top right next to a family - and I mean right next. Like we were practically all sitting at the same table. Low top tables are quite close together so not very private for conversations. Inquired as we saw an empty hightop and was told the table type portion doesnt show up on their iPad and the only open high top was ""booked."" Hmm... I booked one, so somebody else was more important?  However, the food was FANTASTIC. Best steaks ever, awesome swordfish special etc. Waiter's attentiveness diminished once we got our food. Had to flag him down to order desert and drink glasses were empty more than once. But the food was so good that we will give it another try!",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Five of us had a Saturday night dinner.  Both exterior doors to the restaurant were next to tables, blowing in the sub-freezing night when anyone arrived or left, making many seating locations quite uncomfortable.  Our meal took well over one hour from ordering to delivery and most items were cold upon arrival.  The food would have been good had it not been cold.  The staff recognized the issues, was very apologetic and provided free dessert.  The staff did what it could.  But unless the conduct of the kitchen can be improved, we could not recommend it.",2,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Really cold in the booth by the opening door to the patio, other than that all was good",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Potatoes were not cooked all the way on three of the four meals served and salmon was overcooked in one meal.  Seats were a little uncomfortable. Great service, nice wine list, loved the picnic appetizer.",3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Parking is nearly impossible plan on spending 10 plus dollars on parking on non event days more on event days. We had a family of four 3 adults and a child which apparently warrants less than average service. Food was mediocre on quality and time. We had a variety of food filet,salmon,meat loaf &amp; kids grilled cheese. Salmon was less than appetizing I'm not one to eat the skin on salmon and all of the seasoning for the fish was on the sling that was a crispy layer easy to peal off.. Filet was cooked appropriately carrots that came with were rabbit style as in you could munch for hours because of how hard they were.. grilled cheese was supposed to have  Gouda but was just a basic muenster sandwich less than toasted on soggy whit bread.. Meat loaf was meat loaf jars to mess up ...",1,OpenTable Diner,Denver
Food was excellent although the potatoes were over done.  Service was not too good.,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Service was good, very friendly and nice. We ordered an app (crap cakes) that had no taste and was like a spongy cake. Waiter understood and brought out a different app (no charge) bread and fish dip. It was ok (better) however bread too was spongy.   Also people coming in and out of the doors to another area brought in cold wind to us and with the high tables felt too crowded. The steaks I would say were ok to good. I usually never leave reviews and week before ate at Cygnus, butchers, Sovengard and Terras but unfortunately I am leaving this review in hopes things will change and I will try again in the future.",2,Jonn,Grand Rapids
"Every time we go to Iron it has been GREAT, introduced to friends and family and everyone loves the atmosphere, Food, Service EVERYTHING!!!!  All Food is supplied Locally and is yummy.  I have not been disappointed yet and have been there 3 times, dishes I recommend are their Meatloaf, Pot Roast &amp; Walleye - all great dishes.   Staff is very attentive to all guest.  We will keep coming back.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"It was awful. Steaks weren’t cooked to our preference, menu had limited offerings, service was mediocre etc",1,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Excellent food.  Cool industrial look.  Able to handle gluten free preparation.  Highly recommend.,5,MIke,Detroit
"This restaurant was very good. Friendly staff, great atmosphere, and average food.",4,Aman,Grand Rapids
It was too loud for a date night. But very energetic for a group outing.,3,RibeyeLover,Grand Rapids
Outstanding food and a great selection on the menu. I loved the walleye. The steak with mushrooms was one of the best meals my son has had. We don’t drink so can’t comment on the bar choices but it seemed like a fun place to get a drink.  The waitress was excellent. Made sure we had plenty of time to walk to devos center to see les miserables. Will definitely return next time I’m in Grand Rapids.,5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"Terrible.  Would never recommend. Food was below average, price was outrageous.",2,Nemoeight,Grand Rapids
"IRON is a solid choice for a downtown date night option. It's in a great location and has a great interior design/elegant feel to it without being too pretentious. Meals are moderately priced and very tasty.  The staff was nice but nothing above ordinary. All in all, IRON is a nice destination if you're not ready to spend top dollar at some of the other ore high end  fine dining downtown.",4,SteveB,Grand Rapids
"First of all forget about parking, they have no parking and no valet.  I had to park 2 blocks away. They ran out 4 things on the menu. The waiter was very nice and very patient, as we were very disappointed when he told us 4 things on the menu were not available.  I had the pork chop and it was just ok.  For dessert we had the Apple Crisp, but it was frigid cold. You will not see me come back.",1,Chitin,Dallas
My husband and I had tickets for a concert at 20 Monroe. Great location for access to many venues around Grand Rapids. Food was great and so was the service.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Enjoyed the atmosphere and plates. The USDA Prime NY Strip was fairly good, but requested medium-rare and it came out medium. Was not as tender as most USDA Prime beef. Could have been seasoned a bit more BUT it was overall very nice and the price was good for being billed as a USDA Prime beef selection. The Salmon and chicken dishes were very good and tasty. The appetizer chicken wings and the onion soup was nice as well. We look forward to coming back.",4,Gunner2000,Detroit
Awesome!  Will definitely go back!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"I had the pork chop and my boyfriend had the chicken. The chicken was good but the pork chop was so over done I could barley cut it with a steak knife. The flavor was good but so overdone. The price was moderate to high and I was expecting the food to match the price. We did not have time to send my dinner back because we were headed to a concert. We allotted an hour for dinner and the food came out 35 minutes later, which we thought was normal for a busy night.",3,RandiRae,Denver
"We were there on a snowy Sunday morning and, with all the windows, the restaurant was beautiful.  It is located in an interesting spot so it was fun to walk around the market. The staff was very pleasant and our server was good. The Bloody Mary bar was fun. I had the shrimp and grits which were outstanding. The others at the table got the skillets and liked them although they commented that they were fairly small for the price. Our overall experience was very good and I'm sure we'll return!",4,KateU,Dined 6 days ago
"The food was delicious, the servers helpful, and the menu fun - I loved being able to choose my salad ingredients to myself.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Good brunch...nice Bloody Mary bar,4,luvchicago4,San Diego
The food was over priced and underwhelming.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Hummus was outstanding,4,lescoe,Detroit
Awesome food! Lots of gluten free options! I love the create your own salads and the drink menu is very good!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Had the chicken and waffles appetizer which was excellent. Tried the macaroni and cheese that a friend ordered, and it was very cheesy and delicious. I ordered the brick chicken which was a little on the salty side and not what I expected. Was underwhelmed by it and I wished I had ordered something different, like the salmon, I had eaten there in the past. Our server was friendly, but seemed to lack energy and excitement that evening.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Good food, good service. A little noisy at times even though it wasn’t full. Would not recommend for business lunch.",3,DW54,Detroit
This restaurant is located inside a cool indoor market full of unique and fun foodie shops. My family had fun walking around and exploring the market before eating. I highly recommend “the skillet” meal that actually arrives in a hot skillet. The sauces on the side option makes each bite uniquely amazing!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Had a couple of friends in for the Holidays.  Had amazing drinks, apps, and dinner. Staff and management were second to none.",5,Cookkie,Grand Rapids
"excellent service, good food and an enjoyable evening. Something for everyone on the menu - from the meat lovers to the vegetarians.",5,dang,Grand Rapids
It was my first time and I couldn’t be more pleased.,5,Chris,Grand Rapids
Great food!,5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
The music was inappropriate for the setting. The server seemed inpatient and loud. Her follow up was sloppy. The manager was fantastic.,2,PMDShelton,Chicago
"Nice location within the Grand Rapids Downtown Market.  Lunch menu was okay, but overpriced. I had the shrimp and grits, and the portion was along the lines of an appetizer rather than an entree.",3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
This is my new favorite place for lunch and happy hour. Easy parking and a great menu. The build your own salad is fantastic and beautifully presented. The happy hour can't be beat. The cauliflower is a must try!!!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Grilled cheese, Brussels sprouts &amp; cauliflower were all amazing. The staff was great with our 3 kids.  Always a great meal!",5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Love the fries! We also liked the bread on the sandwiches was from another vendor in the Downtown Market - we were able to purchase a loaf to take home!,4,SM3337,Detroit
"My wife and I met our niece here for dinner. We had a great meal. We all ordered salad. The salad fixings were all very fresh. And at a great price. Our server was friendly and attentive. Even the Manager was present, attentive and helpful. Overall a very enjoyable evening",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"I went to Social Kitchen with my 16 yo daughter.  We enjoyed our meal and would recommend the restaurant.  We did have a few issues, but it wouldn't keep me from going back.    I ordered the Brussel sprouts, which I believe should be salty, but these were so salty that I couldn't eat them.  I made a comment to our server about it, and to her credit, she removed it from our bill. We ordered pizza as an appetizer, but it came out after our main meal (our server warned us that it was backed up at the pizza oven).   My daughter had the grilled cheese sandwich, which had guac, carmelized onions, etc.  She really liked it.  I had the hummus with lamb, which was also really good.   The pizza was a little too cheesy, but the crust was good.  We may have liked it more as an appetizer - we were full by the time it finally came out :S Ambiance was fun, my sangria was delish...overall a nice evening.",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Excellent Food, Service and Atmosphere.   We were seated at the exact time of our reservation. Excellent table service. Restaurant is clean and fun.",5,Chris,Grand Rapids
The Chicken salad sandwich is amazing!  As is the fried egg sandwich!  Includes avocado yummm!,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Server was awesome for our gluten free diet! Social kitchen had so Many GF options!!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
It's difficult to understand how a restaurant can get a pizza wrong two times when you have to fill out a paper with exactly what you want on it.,2,Paul,Grand Rapids
"Had the warm chicken salad sandwich - the bread was tasty, the grilled chicken was juicy, and the bacon and spiced pickles kicked it up!  Just wish there had been a few more potato chips in it.  I wish I could remember our server's name because he was awesome!",4,Chip77,Grand Rapids
Loved our dinner at Social.  Food and service was outstanding!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
We had a great dinner. Service was great. Drinks were good. My only criticism was that  all our food choices were VERY salty.,4,eray,Las Vegas
I like this restaurant. It has good food and lots of choices. It's fun to walk around the market as well.,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Can't beat the happy hour! Great cocktails (highly recommend the Daisy and the Irish Mule).  Fries are a must! I love the build your own pizzas and salads. Excellent service as well.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"We really enjoyed our evening out at the Social Kitchen. Our pizzas and appetizer were delishious. My only complaint which was laughed off by our server was our salad was delivered to the table at the same time as our pizza. Salad should always come before the main dish. I made it clear it was to be shared by my husband and I, we were also sharing a pizza.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Service was really friendly and not intimidating. Menu was just the right size. Setting was cozy and kid friendly with a casual but fine dining feel, which is hard to find with a kiddo. More importantly...Food was a pleasant surprise. Full of flavor and thoughtful. We would totally come back.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
We are very happy we found this place on Open Table. This was our first time there and we feel we now have a new favorite place for brunch. Our food was delicious and made with the freshest ingredients. I would recommend the Social Skillet because it allows you to create a dish that is customized to your own personal taste. It is located in the Downtown Market Grand Rapids and has a casual and fun atmosphere.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Great food, and service!  Waiter was very sensitive to food allergy.",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Really bad service. Good food. Accommodated our large group of 12.,2,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Unfortunately, this was not a great visit to Social Kitchen &amp; Bar.  We had a party of about 12 people.  Our drink orderes were staggered and took quite a while to get out.  Our dinners took probably 30 minutes to ALL come out, despite us having ordered all at the same time.  I think our dinner came out in about 3 waves - causing some people to wait to eat, others to start eating, and the birthday girl to not get her meal until last (and on top of that, it was wrong as she specified a different side that didn't happen).  The manager on duty kept us informed about the timing and kept apologizing, but the server almost avoided our table in its entirety because it was awkward that we didn't have food - so we sat without beverage refills while some people ate and some people waited.  Overall, we just felt like it was practically the kitchen's first time preping this food because the order was so divided and there was very little quality attention given to drinks by our server.  What was most surprising was that the restaurant was practically empty when we were there - so it's not like the place was slammed.  The manager on duty did comp the birthday girls meal and provided dessert, but at that point, we were all just disappointed - especially having made this reservation, having put our order in all at once, having had meals that were duplicates of each other, and it not being a busy night.  A bummer that it didn't go as smoothly as it should have.",2,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"This is the second time that I have been here and it is amazing! I loved both of the dishes that I have tried, each recommended by the server.",5,Jackie,San Francisco
"It was good, not great. Food seemed heavy. Hummus, burger, Mac and cheese. Cocktails okay. Service was very good. Dead on a Friday night which surprised me but maybe because this is just a good restaurant in a city with more and more options, some of which are great.",3,Lovefood,Grand Rapids
We had the choose your own ingredients for a salad and pizza.  It was excellent. I think the salad might be my favorite in town.  Also had Kozmopolitan drinks which were delicious and different.  The menu is very interesting and I want to  go back and try a couple other things on it.,5,BenandSue,Grand Rapids
Our server Ella was amazing. She took care of the group (10). One had an issue with an entree and she took care of it immediately and acted in a warm and personable yet professional manner.,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
My boyfriend and I came in for a casual early dinner on a Sunday. We were both very pleasantly surprised and will definitely be back!  I highly recommend making your own salad. The salmon was some of the best I've had in a while (my boyfriend tried the salmon and enjoyed even though he doesn't like seafood). He had the house burger which was delicious and the fries are definitely a must order even if just for the spectacle.,5,emmybemmy21,Grand Rapids
"La Scala has the most delicious pear and cheese pasta- I get it every time.  The bread was straight from the oven and was really great.  My chianti was good and well-priced.  It was hard to hear over the wine-tasting, but it didn't deter from the great meal.",4,MMarieJ,New Orleans
"It was great other than our waitress must have been in training. She was great but the guy following her around, I assume was the person training her, was a bit annoying.  Other than that it was very nice and enjoyable.",4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Food was good.  Steak was cooked nicely.  Service was excellent.  Side portions were extremely skimpy.  Overall I enjoyed it.  I will go back.,4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"First visit to Rome. In that this was the only option on Open Table in town we figured it had to be decent.  We were not disappointed.  Sevcie was excellent.  Ordered a few appetizers. Actually we went early and spent time in their lounge.  Great staff, great food and if we ever go back to that part of Georgia this will definitely be on our bucket list.",5,Jimmy,Charleston
Our family loves  this restaurant. We have had many wonderful meals there as well as many celebrations. They always make us feel special. The pastas are wonderful. I love the smoked salmon appetizer. The tomato bisque is the best I have ever had.,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"My first time at La Scala and I had the Veak la scala - it was the BEST VEAL DISH I ever had!  Loved the food in this great little gem in the middle of Rome, GA!",4,Scoob,Atlanta
Great food and service. From the appetizers to dessert everything was superb.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Our anniversary dinner was delightful. Very attentive staff, delicious food and wine, and lovely ambiance. A great evening!",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
The food was better than anywhere else. On top of that the waitress was great and the atmosphere was one that couldn't be beaten. It was an amazing experience overall.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"The food was excellent! The server Luke was the perfect amount attentive, while not overbearing. I know when salt and pepper is absent from the dining room the experience will either be absolutely lacking because of over confidence, or a great food experience from sure hands. This was the latter.",5,RJHMW,New York Area
"A very nice dinner and a knowledge, helpful waitress. A minor annoyance that the bussers were overly ambitious. Felt that we were being rushed.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Had an excellent meal, and our server, Preston, was outstanding.",5,tijobone,Grand Rapids
Made a reservation for 8 people. Bistro had us down for 2 people? Were informed that open table is not the preferred method of reserving a table and the limit is 4 people for such reservations? Were seated at two high tops near the rear exit. Was rather awkward. Couln't hear each other talk? Staff were gracious. Food was good.,2,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"Special evening with my wife. Professional host took care of every request made prior to arrival and or server was phenomenal.  Great Dinner, definitely worth the price",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Went to treat my love for a birthday dinner and was yet again impressed. Have been here before and enjoyed it very much again this visit. Great food, great atmosphere and a great server who was kind and prompt. When we return to Grand Rapids again I am sure Bella Vita will be where we dine. Fantastic job guys.",5,zhutchman,Grand Rapids
Always great food at Bistro!,5,Nancy,Grand Rapids
"My husband and I recently enjoyed a great meal celebrating our anniversary at Bistro Bella Vita.  The extra touches (white tablecloth, flowers on the table, and dessert on the house) were so appreciated and helped make the night special. Food and service were phenomenal...my husband's beef bourgionne was so tender and flavorful! I had the four cheese ravioli which was very good, though portion size was small compared to other dishes. My only complaint is that the restaurant gets pretty loud on a Saturday night, so we went somewhere afterwards for quieter conversation. I'd definitely recommend bistro to anyone for a great night out!",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
We so enjoy Bistro Bella Vita.  We will come back and recommend to everyone!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Waitstaff was attentive and friendly, menu selection was good but slightly expensive.  Noise level was a bit much on a busy weekend.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Fantastic as always. Our favorite when we get to GR. Chloe was our server and she did an outstanding service as well as being very personable. See you all again soon,5,Russ,Grand Rapids
We enjoyed our dining experience.  Food was delicious and presentation was excellent.,5,Rockford61,Grand Rapids
"We enjoyed our lunch with my wife and a friend, our food was really tasty and original, especially the ravioli 4 cheeses!",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Excellent, creative meal. Really good service. Would definitely go again.",5,Hutch,Chicago
"Food was delicious, atmosphere was great, the service was a little less then I would have expected for a restaurant of this caliber. Hostess was great and our reservation was handled perfectly but the server was a little lackadaisical with the food and drink orders(They were not overly busy). It did not seem like our experience was much of a priority for said person BUT he was very nice when he was attending to our orders. All in all i just would have expected a little bit more attentativeness and maybe an emphasis on the experience/special occasion we were there for as it was blatantly obvious we were there for a birthday but not once did the server ask/say/or do anything to acknowledge it.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Booked a reservation with OpenTable and was very pleased. Bistro Bella Vita honored my request for my wife's 60th birthday and put us in a little corner with a linen tablecloth to make it extra special .  Nice wine selection, some really creative salads and main entrées and great service.  I was so pleased that I called the manager over to thank her for making my wife's special occasion so nice.",5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"Anniversary dinner, first time visit it was worth it and we will probably return",4,MikeC,Grand Rapids
"Ah, this was my first visit to the Grand Rapids area in, well, 46 years. It has changed and so have I.  Pretty, smoothly functioning and serviced large-scale restaurant with an Italian name, French names on the bathrooms and a dish called gnocchi francaise; well, that kinda says it all. The special paella was quite good. Downtown Grand Rapids 2016!",4,OpenTable Diner,Orange County
"I went here with my boyfriend for my birthday, and was not disappointed! I ordered the salmon with butter soup, which came with roasted cauliflower, mushrooms, and kale. The salmon was wonderful, and the other parts paired fantastically. The portion of salmon wasn't huge, but I didn't mind since we were going to get dessert. My boyfriend ordered the Rustica pizza, and was very happy with it. The pizzas are a decent size, maybe a medium at pizzaria, but he ate the whole thing. They have a great dessert deal where you can get 3 for $16, where 1 is ordinarily $7.50. We got the tiramisu, the crème brûlée, and the flourless chocolate cake, all of which were amazing. I'd definitely go back.",5,Madzyw,Grand Rapids
Excellent service and food . Will definitely be revisiting this place.,5,Gabe,Grand Rapids
Food and service was excellent. It was a bit loud for dinner conversations.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids

We had a very pleasurable dining experience with an outstanding waitress who understood we were not in a hurry yet was very attentive to our needs.  Excellent,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Always a great meal at Bistro Bella Vista, great location if you have a night out downtown.  They always have a specials menu and we like to try new things.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
The pecan pie was outstanding!  All of our servers were great and personable,4,OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 5, 2016"
Amazing service as well as incredible food. Truly an experience set in a great atmosphere. I had Wegyu beef as well as Amish chicken and I can honestly say it was the best dinner I've ever had.,5,Justin,Grand Rapids
"Visited recently on a trip to Grand Rapids. My wife and I had the Antipasta, Goat Cheese, and the bread for two to start and all three were great. For our entrees I had the Cassoulet which was amazing and my wife had the Pot au Feu from the specials list, which she said was amazing. The only knock I could see on the food was that you could say it lacked color as there was a lot of browns and beige on the plate but to me it was just amazing, unpretentious comfort food.  Everything was cooked and seasoned perfectly and the portion sizes were much bigger than we anticipated. For dessert we had the Cheese Cake and the Pecan Pie special, again, both of which were very good. The service was great also. We never felt rushed or like the waiter was trying to up sell us on drinks, apps or desserts and when we asked him for help choosing between a few options he was honest, not pushy and didn't just steer us towards the most expensive item. Overall it was a great experience and I'd highly recommend it.",5,SGTSparty,Detroit
We were there for a birthday celebration. our waiter was very attentive and helpful. He recommended a great bottle of wine and his recommendations on the entree selections were very helpful. We had a very nice time.,5,bluebird,Grand Rapids
"The duck ravioli was delicious and the service was fantastic. It was a little dark in the restaurant and the portions were just barely enough. Overall, I would go back based on the quality of the food.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Overall a very nice restaurant with a good atmosphere and fine food. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and suggested a very good wine pairing. I would come back and suggest the restaurant to others.,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Service was outstanding.  Food was well above average.  Pasta samplers on weekends are great values.  Bartender is a star!,4,Titan65,Grand Rapids
"One of the  meals we've eaten in Grand Rapids. Portions are very large. We split a beet and arugula salad with goat cheese.and the cassoulet, which was very good but always very rich. Our server Chloe was knowledgeable and she really hustled around to keep all of her tables happy. The menu was fantastic--I had a difficult time choosing because everything looked so good. Definitely will return!",5,Dazzlegirl,San Francisco
Great service and great tasting food. The food was so good.,5,Allen,Grand Rapids
"Dined with friends.  Our server was a delight.  Great help with wine and menu selections.  The pot a feu was amazing, so was the blue cheese beef tenderloin pasta.  Both dishes were features that night I think. Highly recommend this place.  It never disappoints.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
This was our fourth or fifth time.  Our server was fantastic again and the meals were absolutely perfect and delicious!,5,usererror,Grand Rapids
My wife and I enjoyed a marvelous dinner.  The server was attentive and helpful.  The menu was robust and the food was absolutely delicious.  I am looking forward to my next visit.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Service was great, atmosphere was very pleasant and the food was very good. This was an abnormal Thanksgiving which worked out very well by going to Old Burdicks. Thank you",5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
I went there Sunday night and it was my best experience ever. They have a new menu and the ribs were falling off the bone tender. There was a steak with wild mushrooms and mashed sweet potatoes that was the best thing in Kalamazoo. They also had the best wine by the glass selection and the best draft beer selection in town. It’s been a while since I went there and what an overhaul.  Take my advice and try it out.,5,OpenTable Diner,Miami
"The waitress was very good, especially since we had an accidental water spill, delaying our ordering, etc. Good menu choices and generous portions were served reasonably quickly considering the busy period we were there. The food ordered by our party was delicious and reasonably priced. The are was not noisy and normal conversation could be carried on, despite the number of diners and floor activity. The dinner invoices were handled ok, so we could get to our next event in a timely manner. Parking is a problem as the restaurant fronts a busy downtown street, but I was able to park in the ramp servicing the Radisson easily and for reasonable charges.",4,DavidR,Detroit
Our experience at Bar Divani was excellent.  We were celebrating our Anniversary and our server did a fabulous job! Our food was outstanding too!,5,Ggwillis,Detroit
"It was a night to remember with a romantic atmosphere and friendly, fast service.  My reservation was private like I asked and better then expected.AMAZING drinks that the bartender made special for us. I would recommend this place to chill out with ambient music and fashion oriented decor. I loved everything about this place. Thanks to Matt and Toren for a night they made exactly how I had planned.",5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"AWFUL SERVICE!!!!!  We had made Valentine's Day dinner reservations via OpenTable.com.  The night before Valentine's Day, ""Steve"" at Bar Divani called and left an abrupt voice mail saying that they had ""issues"" on their end with reservations and could not accommodate us!  This left my wife and me no other options on this Valentine's Saturday.  NONE.  Calling the night before a big event - one that I had carefully planned - is completely inexcusable.  I STRONGLY recommend NOT patronizing this poor excuse for a ""dining establishment.""  There are plenty others in the area, Tre Cugini, 1913 Room, the Grille at 1913, etc., MUCH more worthy of your business.",1,TonyO,San Francisco
Excellent venue in downtown Grand Rapids with fabulous food,5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Wonderful gluten free options. Celiac safe.  Knowledgeable staff.  Highly recommend! We will be back.,5,ElizabethT,Grand Rapids
"Went to Bistro Bella Vita for an early anniversary dinner.  Our waiter Harrison was amazing - attentive but not intrusive.  The menu was full of options for all tastes, and I was able to find something easily that was lactose-free.  The cocktails were delicious, the food was worth every penny, and even though the restaurant was full by time we were done eating, the noise level remained very low and our waiter never forgot about us!  All in all, it was an amazing experience that I would recommend to anyone looking for an enjoyable night out with their significant other, the family or good friends!",5,Sam14,Grand Rapids
"Decidedly average.  Chicken was very dry, service was slow, and bar prices are too high.",2,DJMack,Grand Rapids
"Table was ready.  Food was excellent.   Our waiter could have been a little more attentive, but we didn't and are not complaining.   It was a nice evening.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids

"I had dinner with my sister, brother in law, and fiancé at Bistro Bella Vita and it was fabulous. The food was delicious, the service was spot on, and the atmosphere was posh in a downtown with some real duds for food.

As always it was a pleasure. Spencer is an outstanding server!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Phenomenal service! I love coming here!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Wonderful Valentine's Day!  Table was ready at reservation time.  Had a drink at the bar first. Couldn't have been better,5,jferg,Grand Rapids
"It was ok. My steak was a little burnt,  but not intolerable. The mashed potatoes  were soaked in the wine sauce but again,  it wasn't so bad that I didn't eat them.  Also, my wife's Salmon portion was stingy.  However our server was great!  Very pleasant, infinitive &amp; quick. Overall,  everything was fine.  But nothing to rave about.",3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"The Food and service was Very good. Thought the overall price was too much for this kind of restaurant. Spending 170.00 for three people and having to pay for the bread, (free at most comparable restaurants) seemed odd.  Tables were very close together so privacy was not an option.",4,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
The service was very slow but waiter was pleasant. Just long wait between seeing him. The food taste and quality was not inline with the price. Some of the food was very good for price but most expensive dish was not. You have to pay $1.50 pp for bread. Sorry but that is just ridiculous especially since it was just ok.,3,OpenTable Diner,Las Vegas
"Our waiter was fantastic and everyone at our tables absolutely loved their food.  We had appetizers as well, and they were incredible too!",5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"We had a nice evening with friends. We like coming downtown to Bistro Belle Vita and always enjoy our meal. The only downside is parking. I needed handicap parking and there's none. In fact, parking is difficult and challenging most of the time. We had to use valet parking at $12 plus tip....no choice unfortunately.    Now, add that to the meal price and it starts to become an issue for some!",4,Gesam,Grand Rapids
"The setting was really nice. When you reserve on the site and have a special occasion, they set up your table with linens and flowers. Also I didn't have to wait in any line as well by reserving the table early. It was nice to have that extra look for the occasion. Food was good, but seems like some portions were smaller that expected but the food was still good. Desserts we had were really good and a nice touch to end the dinner experience. Thank you!",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
The food and service were great! Lots of options for drinks.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"The food was amazing!  Our waitress was very good and helpful.  It was a little loud and the hvac blew over us at the table making it a bit cool, but they moved us and it was fine.  Looking forward to going back.  Happy hour deals are only in the bar, so sit there if you want to utilize those great deals.",5,Gregsfinds,Grand Rapids
"Great atmosphere, excelent service and delicious food  !",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"The food here is decent. I wouldn't say amazing. The prices were ok, but you don't necessarily feel like you walked out feeling like you got more than you paid for. There were a lot of kids when we ate there around 6 PM on a Saturday night. It was also loud in general. The service was good. Our waiter brought us the wrong appetizer, but allows us to eat it and gave us the correct one afterwards. We were not charged for the wrong dish.",3,usmc2msu,Chicago
One of the best restaurants in Grand Rapids. Good no matter what you are in the mood for from informal wood fired pizza and salad to a special 3-4  course dinner. Very nice creative selections full of flavor.  Great atmosphere and service.  We are never disappointed.,5,OpenTable Diner,Tampa
"A great experience. Food, service, and atmosphere were fantastic. The waitress was extremely helpful and attentive but did not make a ""pest "" of herself. This is still one of our favorite restaurants in Grand Rapids.",5,affamee,Grand Rapids
"We enjoy Bella Vita for lunch or dinner. Eat here often , late lunch or dinner excellent menu, good wine list and cocktails.  Favorite pear martini!",5,OpenTable Diner,Naples
"Pasta was phenomenal, paella was alright. Waitress was awesome.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Bistro Bella vita delivered for us! We took our grandson here and had a wonderful time. We ordered bruschetta and it was inadvertently delivered to the wrong table. We know this only because our server told us, ordered a new one, and comped us on it. That type of integrity is terrific and we really appreciated it. Great meal!",5,bvan14,Grand Rapids
Wonderful time with friends and great food!,5,Slick,Detroit
"Excellent service, food was awesome. Usually my first choice for dinner.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids

Fabulous food. Great atmosphere and wonderful service! Definitely a must try.,5,Jd2113ac0509,Grand Rapids
Great martinis! Tom took great care of us. He chose our appetizer. Yummy calamari! The seafood paella was delish as well!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"We had a party of eight and each and every person enjoyed their meals, and said it was the best food.",5,PattiS,Grand Rapids
"Bistro Bella Vita has a great vibe and is located next to Van Andel arena and a block away from Ionia street in Grand Rapids. My wife and I had dinner here for our wedding anniversary. The food was good, if not slightly overpriced (imo). The drink list was substantial, and we had a bottle of  a great sauvignon blanc that was very affordable. Overall, we enjoyed our dinner here.",4,Tyler,Detroit
"Bistro Bella Vita was as great as always, we've never been disappointed!",5,Nancy,Grand Rapids
Excellent food and Connor did a fantastic job. We celebrated 3 birthdays and everyone felt very special with free birthday treats courtesy of Connor and the restaurant.,5,PattiS,Grand Rapids
"My fiance and I went there to celebrate our 1 year engagement anniversary.  Our waiter was short with us, not much of a personality.   I asked what entree he would recommend, and he said "" ehh, its all good.""  Well, as I understand the food is of good quality, I was looking for some help from him, yet received fairly little. The food was expensive compared to the quality.  Her pasta was below average, the pesto sauce was very thick, almost too pasty to eat.  I had the Amish chicken, which was essentially just a rotisserie chicken with mash potatoes.  It was very average.  The appetizer was decent and the dessert was alright, but both of our entrees were below what our expectations were for such a revered restaurant.  Additionally our wait service was less than enthusiastic and it equals up to not a very positive impression for a first time visit.  Most likely will not be going back.",2,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Went here on a friday night for date night at 7:30. Our reservation was promptly served and we were seated near one of the sides away from the bar. Wait service was attentive and knowledgable making food recommendations to both of us. Our cocktails before dinner were good tasting and reasonably priced. We both had pastas for our entrees that were tasty and cooked perfectly and seemingly authentic (I am not an italian or medeterrainian food expert by any means). The overall layout was nice, but it was very loud even with the place not being that busy for the entirety of our dinner service with us having to speak louder than normal for conversations. Parking was tricky since this was the same night as an event downtown so the lots and side streets were all full nearby (probably won't be an issue normally), so I went with valet, which was still reasonably priced and convenient. Overall it was a great dining experience and we had a good time, I will go back in the future.",5,TommyG,Grand Rapids
"We had our wedding reception at Bistro Bella Vita 13 years ago, and love to visit as often as possible.  The food and drinks are always amazing.  Our server was appropriately attentive, welcoming, and helpful.  We definitely plan to return for more amazing dinners.",5,OpenTable Diner,New Orleans
"I am sorry, but this restaurant has gone down hill; my food had no flavor at all and the carrots were so mushy it was like eating baby food.  Service was super slow, I am cutting them a break there since it was New Years Eve and busy. The one good thing was my Chocolate Martini; I may be pack for drinks, but probably not for dinner.  I can get a lot tastier meal else where for a lot fairer price; sorry.",3,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"Service was okay, but our waiter was a little serious.  He didn't laugh at our jokes.  Either we were not funny, or he didn't think we were funny.  So may be a little ""stuffy.""  The menu had many great choices.  The special that night, Black Cod, was not very good - a little oversold.   But, the Burger was very flavorful.  Crab cakes were perfectly prepared but needed accompanying sauce.  Thai Shrimp was yummy and perfect level of spice (have a glass of water handy if you don't like spicy).  You must order the Award Winning ""margarita"" -- Something Shrub ( I can't remember the name - it has tequila and thyme).  It's AWESOME!  It’s the kind of cocktail you crave!!  Also the Arugula Salad is a must!",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"The owner came up during dinner and engaged us in a conversation.  It was really clear that she cared about what we thought and our experience.  Then, after recommending the next course, she sent the chef out to deliver it personally.  He was quite humble, but his food is absolutely exceptional!    First visit, but already one of our favorite restaurants in Grand Rapids...",5,BalancedGuy,Grand Rapids
"Thoroughly enjoyed the petit fillet and am addicted to the gruyere potatoes. My partner enjoyed the lamb ravioli - the sauce smelled delicious (couldn't try it due to an allergy.) I love the atmosphere, the service, and above all, the cuisine!",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Bar Divani is my go to location when friends and I go to the Arena for concerts.  The location allows us to park our cars away from the crowds which means getting home quicker after the events.  BD's food is always interesting and delicious, although a bit pricey.  Our server was Michael- he was friendly, quick, and accommodating to our pre-concert schedule.  I esp love BD's big list of cocktails - BD is the only place where I can order Singapore Sliings!",5,TravelLady511,Grand Rapids
We had wonderful food and service.,5,AmyA,Grand Rapids
Food was great. Prices are very reasonable for the quality of the food.,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"I took my mother, who was visiting from out of town, here for her birthday as a surprise because it had her favorite foods:  hamburgers and crème brulee.  These two foods are not normally found together on a menu, except in an upscale restaurant.  We both agreed it was the best gourmet burger we ever tasted!  The crème brulee was excellent, too!  Our waitress was very attentive and helpful.  She mentioned that most everything that came out of the kitchen was made from scratch, even down to the ketchup!  The restaurant was mindful of the ambiance details including interestingly shaped dishes and blue glass water glasses.  This establishment has been in Grand Rapids for many years and I have never patronized it.  I plan to take my husband here so he can experience this Grand Rapids gem!  Good work, Bar Divani!!",5,suee,Cincinnati
"Our food was amazing! The staff was super friendly-the manager and the chef both stopped at our table. Our waitress was great, also.  I gave the price 4 stars instead of 5 because I don't care how good the food is, some places are just too pricey. But for a special occasion, we like romance, and Bar Divani is really great!",5,MichelleM,Grand Rapids
"Great food, quick and courteous service. Music was a bit loud for dinner service, but overall I was very happy with the experience.",5,ACAM,Grand Rapids
Ambiance wonderful as always.   Food was delicious.  Remains a favorite for my wife and I.  A very nice Valentine's Day,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"The owner is new and we could tell as we use to come in frequently before.  I like the new look, the new drink menue, the food menue needs a little work.  Also the owner spent a lot of time with some ladies from out of town who happen to stop in there, while barely acknowledging us.  We stopped coming here before because of this type of service.  We will be back to see how a second visit goes.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"We had dinner a few time prior to our last visit and couldn't wait to get back.  We made reservations on Friday the weekend of Valentines.  The restaurant was getting ready to serve a pre-fixed menu for Saturday.  They had a walleye special which the guys got and were very happy with.  I order the duck and it was over cooked, dry, not even a portion size breast.  Couldn't even eat it.  Luckily we had gotten a few appetizers which satisfied.  Not sure I'll rush back out anytime soon.",4,KevinandLisa22,Grand Rapids
"I love a good pepper encrusted steak but in this case I think they used more pepper than steak.  Perhaps switch to a milder malabarpepper. Basically ruined a good steak. Not rocket science to get a steak decent.  Great ambiance, appetizers, chicken entree, and service however.  Skip the steak until they fix it.",4,Tastemaker,Las Vegas
"We had starters for four which were all very good with a bottle of wine recommend by the resident wine expert.  We had four entrees.  The salmon special was excellent.  The scallops, and the burger were extremely salty.  The Korean ribs were good, but still a bit on the salty side.  When we mentioned to the front manager, she told us that they always served their food 'well seasoned'. Her attitude and approach to dealing with our comments was totally inappropriate and nearly offensive. In short, we like going to bar divani, but it will be a while before we go back because of the over 'seasoned' food.",3,DinePwr,Grand Rapids
"Everything we ordered from apps to our entres was over salted. The apps were inedible but we were not comped for it. Even after we complained about the apps being salty both our entres were again over salted - edible but not enjoyable. Service was not super - had to ask for our waters to be refilled at least 4 times, knowledge of wine list was not that great and was not helpful when asked about menu details. Bar area is noisy but if you want to go here try and sit away from the bar",3,AriC,Grand Rapids
This place was by far one of best places to eat I had the burger and it was so perfect!!!! It had a beautiful crunch to it and so filling!! I would go every day thank you so much grate place to release stress,5,Yummm,Grand Rapids
"My boyfriend and I dined here on a Saturday evening for our anniversary. We had made reservations ahead of time, so when we arrived, out table was already prepared with our glasses already filled with water. The food was served very fast and it was delicious! One thing I loved was that the servers all helped each other out, it wasn't a strict one waiter per table thing. We left cry happy and satisfied! Great for a date night, whenever you want to feel fancy and dress up!",5,Tkue,Grand Rapids
"Service, food, ambience all excellent. My only complaint is that the wine pours are extremely small. Need to be more generous!",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"My girlfriend and I went to bar divani for our one year anniversary and were overall very pleased with our choice. Our server was very personable, friendly, and attentive without being a pest. The food was delicious from appetizer, through soup and salad, to our main entrees. And the atmosphere was very pleasant. The one issue we had was the table at which we were sat. It was in the corner by the door and maybe two feet from another table. So when that table was occupied by another couple, it was basically like we were sitting at one table with total strangers; effectively canceling the intimacy of the occasion for me and my girlfriend. While this is really nobody's fault, I think it will be important for others to specify what table they'd like to avoid a similar situation. It certainly will not preclude is from returning in the future in other special occasions.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
great food. excellent service by Michael who was very knowledgeable on wine selections and efficient and timely with his service.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Excellent food, service and ambience. My friends and I loved the food. The salmon, chicken and brisket were all delicious.",5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit

"The bar tender knows his stuff - do not be afraid to order items not found on menu, he has some great craft cocktails.  The cheif is out of this world - visted our table to assure pleasure.  The whole experience was over the top - A most visit.",5,Dave,Detroit
We stumbled upon this nice little restaurant during Art Prize weekend.  We only had a couple drink and the hummus but had a great time.  The hummus was the best we've ever had!!!  The service and ambiance were both great.  We would definitely return!,4,Wino,Grand Rapids
Great Food... The small plates are very pricey for the amount. Liked the diverse menu,4,easytoplease,Grand Rapids
"Placed drink order, took 25 minutes. Cup of lobster bisque was $11 and was too salty. My wife and I spent $100 and nothing was memorable. Will not be returning.",2,BPS22,San Francisco
"Let me put it this way. Two in our party ordered gazpacho. One hour after order time, still no food, including the COLD SOUP. The waiter made an excuse about the ""ticket falling behind something"" we have all worked in restaurants- don't snow the snowman. No attempt to buy a round of drinks or make the situation right.  For years I have had friends try to get me there and finally, we made it happen. I will not be back nor would I recommend this to anyone. Mistakes happen, I understand that. But to not communicate in a forthright way (we had to keep asking what was happening) combined with no attempt to try to fix the problem - we are easy people- makes for no reason to return.",1,Jill,Los Angeles
"My best friend and I attended during restaurant week in Grand Rapids. The restaurant week menu was amazing and excellently priced at $28 for an appetizer, entree and dessert. My Korean bbq ribs had amazing flavor and the corn bread that came along with the entree was mouth watering. My friend had the pork tenderloin and was also drooling.  I'm not a huge dessert fan, but they were included and my cherry  turnover with chocolate was tasty and sweet. Our server was super fun and recommended a moscato for my self and red wine for my bestie that we both VERY MUCH enjoyed. We were attending an event at the BOB and I forgot to bring our printed tickets and the owner, Molly, printed them for us. We will be back.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"The atmosphere was pleasant, the lighting and ambiance was wonderful. The staff were pleasant and very helpful. Our wait for our food once ordered was minimal and absolutely delish! Great night, great dinner and great time thank you BarDivani.",5,Satiety,Grand Rapids
"We joined two friends of ours for Restaurant Week and had a terrific time. The bar menu is great with some really fun classic and inventive cocktails. We've come to Bar Divani several times, and enjoy when special dinners are offered. We've had wine tastings, a French dinner there, and more. The menu is inventive and when they offer three or four course meals, the plates always go together in a way that excites the palate. Thanks for always giving us a little bit of a surprise.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
We ate here during Restaurant Week and were pleased with the selection and portions. Our server was very nice and attentive.,5,Kathleen,Grand Rapids
"I stopped in on a Friday night around 6 for a drink with my boyfriend before I had a dinner reservation with a friend. We sat at the bar and the bartender introduced himself, which I liked. He asked what flavor profiles we were looking for and I told him I wanted a cocktail that was refreshing and ""not too sweet."" To which he curtly replied, ""cocktails aren't supposed to be sweet."" Okay then. He made me a cocktail that he ""won an award for"", with tequila, cucumber and watermelon. It was pretty good. I was just not impressed with the way the bartender spoke to me. I appreciate being able to learn about craft cocktails, but it came off in the wrong tone.   After our drinks, my friend and I sat down for dinner. It was restaurant week, so we did three courses for $28. Our server was interesting to say the least. He kept making semi inappropriate comments that made us feel slightly uncomfortable. For example. My friend commented that she wasn't sure what she wanted. He said, ""oh, I'll tell you what you want."" Okaaaay. We were able to enjoy our meals but I was definitely turned off by the server's attention to us.  We both ordered lamb chops for an appetizer. They were delicious &amp; perfectly cooked. I could have eaten two more servings! For my entree, I got fried chicken &amp; waffles. The flavors were amazing! The chicken was Panko crusted and it reminded me of Japanese katsu. The waffles were very good and there was a sauce on them. Together the flavors reminded me of chicken pot pie. My friend had the pork tenderloin which was a huge portion but not super flavorful. For dessert I had white chocolate creme brûlée which was so good! My friend had a cherry turnover which she enjoyed.  Overall, I was very happy with the food. I would definitely go back for that. The service left a bad taste in my mouth though. The bartenders attitude and the inappropriate comments from our server made me feel uncomfortable. I would hope and assume that that's not typical of the staff at Divani.",4,jeva106,Detroit
"We love Bar Divani, especially for sampling during Restaurant Week!  Excellent Atmosphere, great service, excellent food.  Notable finds, unique delicacies.  I will definitely come back for some of the things that we sampled during our visit.  What a treasure we have in Grand Rapids with Bar Divani.  I loved the Valet Parking (and watching the reaction of the Valets to determine who would get the chance to park the Stingray!  Ha!).  It was quite convenient and a plus for busy downtown, but I often find myself parking nearby just for a nice walk downtown (the Downtown Market isn't far away----although I prefer enjoying Bar Divani in the evening after the market is closed).  Highly recommended!",5,DowntownTreasure,Grand Rapids
"Wed night - excellent trio musical group. I travel great restaurant cities like Provudence and Washington, and this group had great songs, sound level, and connection with the patrons.",4,OpenTable Diner,New England
"Our stop in Grand Rapids was made more special because of the fantastic cocktails made by Chris.  Chris is a master of his craft and a delight to chat with.  His explanation of the drinks and ingredients was insightful and entertaining.   Our group is usually a challenge, as each person prefers a different liquor (rum, vodka, bourbon). His ability to mix, shake, and stir is just spot on. We tried to throw him a curve, and instead each new concoction was a delight to our taste buds:  from the Rum Sour to the Strawberry Quick to the Old-Fashioned Sanders Coffee drink.  Further, the two cocktails he designed for the 2015 Grand Cocktail Competition (A Midsummer Night’s Shrub and Emerald City Julep) are scrumptious.  And, yes we did enjoy burgers (one of the best on the U.S.) and fish tacos we also tasty.   If you’re in Grand Rapids, this is the place to be …. And your belly should be at the bar.",5,AdventureGirl,Washington DC

"We found the smal plates portions to be very little food for the price. Gentleman that poured our wine spilled mine on table as pouring, then wasn't going to wipe it up, as a result, when I picked up my glass to drink it, I had wine dripping on my clothing.....didn't seem very professional or accommodating. No apology offered either.  The food we he was good, atmosphere is nice as well. Our waitress was very sweet and helpful as well As!",3,Micky,Grand Rapids
Delicious three course menu with a great variety of options!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Divani continues to be the intimate experience that is has been. There was a larger group that elevated the noise levels from time to time but we were otherwise able to carry on a conversation at reasonable levels. Service at the bar and table was highly attentive without be overbearing. Food was excellent.,5,OpenTable Diner,Las Vegas

"We went for restaurant week and so had a special 3 course menu for $28.  The waiter, Michael, was friendly and knew a great deal about the food choices.  My Beef Wellington  was prepared to perfection and very tender.  The French onion soup had a special ""tang"" and was very tasty.  The strawberry cheesecake was also unique.  The chef really is excellent, in my opinion.  I would return, even though the pricing will be higher.",5,NancyW,Grand Rapids
"Can't say enough good things about this "" GR Gem"". Pre concert dinner for 8. Rebecca was awesome! I pre-ordered all dinners 4 days earlier to save time, &amp; she had everything ready. She also personally greeted and served. Atmosphere - so cool! Drinks were great. Appetizers were delivered with dinner following. Everything was delicious and warm. Very impressed with service, friendliness, and efficiency of staff. Kudos to chef for all food. Burgers were huge &amp; delicious, Restaurant Week Specials were fantastic! Loved the rangoons. The risotto was a little salty, but overall great! Desserts / wow!  I especially liked the ""black pearl"". Was not expecting it to look or taste so fantastic! We were fed, paid, &amp; on our way to the concert in plenty of time. Many thanks to Rebecca and staff! 👏👏",5,GRnative,Grand Rapids

"Bar Divina is a remarkable bar and eatery.  The drinks were creative and wonderfully tasty.  We ordered two small plates to serve as appetizers for our group of three; the goat cheese with Pomodoro  sauce and Polynesian prawns were beautifully served and delicious.  The entrees, the filet, the risotto and the Scottish salmon were well presented and all three tasted ""divina"".  The ambiance of Divina is first class chic, comfortable, calming and sophisticated.  I highly recommend the restaurant, staff, drinks and food were superb.",5,umami,Detroit

"We dined at Divani after a Griffins Hockey game. The game went to double overtime, so we had to keep pushing our reservation back. Someone from Divani called to let us know the kitchen was closing soon, but we were still welcome to come. We made it just in time to place a food order, and had great food. We chose the crab cakes, caprese salad, charcuterie board, and flourless chocolate torte.  What awesome service, not too many other restaurants would call a guest like that. We've always liked Divani, but I LOVE them now!",5,CGreen09,Grand Rapids

"What a pleasant surprise! I've been avoiding trying this place because Ionia isn't always known for its cuisine but rather loud frat boys, drunk girls, French fries, and pizza. So imagine my delight when we dined here and found everything about this place charming and delicious. I highly recommend this restaurant.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"We went for Easter Brunch. The options all looked very interesting and when they arrived we loved all except for the duck quiche. I don't eat the crust of quiche because wheat flour gives me heartburn and normally that isn't a problem, as I just eat the filling. However, instead of being a big slab, the quiche was a small, flat individual tart. It was very tasty, but was mostly crust. I should probably have asked for a replacement dish, but didn't do that. I wish I had because the service was so attentive they likely would have provided something else. At the beginning the shrimp mango salad was lovely and at the end the creme brulee dessert was simply marvelous!",4,OpenTable Diner,Dallas
If you haven't been here in awhile you should go- the food was great!!  This could be one of our new favorite restaurants!,5,GRfoodie,Detroit
"We went here after an award ceremony at GVSU and the staff ands food was amazing. Courtney was our server and she was so accommodating and offered great recommendations (she recommended the lasagne to me and it was well worth her word). She even brought out a slice of cake for my party to share in celebration of my award. All in all, a great way to end a great night.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Always awesome!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Food was superb, made from scratch with local ingredients.  Drinks were a tad pricey and not very strong, but very tasty.  Definitely recommend going at Happy Hour for cheap drinks/food.  Our waitress was super friendly and helpful, but it took about 10-15 min sitting there before she finally made it to our table.  The place was full, but not packed.  Regardless, I'd recommend this place for the high quality of food.  Great date night place for sure.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"First time dining experience at Divani; and, will return. Atmosphere was friendly and inviting. Annali was exceptional as our server and provided interesting insight on the restaurant as well. Also, was warmly greeted by the owner Molly. Quality of the food, taste and presentation was excellent and definitely confirmed the abilities of the executive chef and staff. Kudos to the restaurant for an experience that exceeded the expectations of our dining party!",5,Posse3,Grand Rapids
My Mom and I went here before our Paint Nite.  What a great place to have dinner!  The food is all made from scratch and was absolutely delectable!!!!  You have to try the blue cheese stuffed olive appetizer.  It is to die for.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Thw waitress was awesome at her job and we received our food in a timelt manner. The food was great and displayed beautifully. I like the dark candle lit atmosphere, but I think it could use a little more light. Overall a great experience.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Quiet dinner at 8:15pm on a Friday. It was great timing because the crowds had subsided and we had a cozy spot and nice conversation. The service by Nick was impeccable - he provided great suggestions for wine and food and overall made our visit very enjoyable. It was our first time in a long time going to Divani and I'm sorry we waited so long. The creative interpretation of caprese salad, the sumptuous bone marrow, duck 3-ways, and salmon special were delicious and beautifully plated. We even (and we rarely do this anymore) decided to get dessert and it was a lovely way to finish the meal (thank you for the decaf, Nick ;) Thanks to all at Divani &amp; we'll see you soon.",4,Carolyn,Grand Rapids
"The food, service and ambience at Bar Divani are always top notch.  My daughter and I both feel it is the best restaurant in Grand Rapids.",5,AmyA,Grand Rapids
a great place for happy hour...very good values and nice wine and cocktail list,5,janays,Las Vegas
"We came to Bar a divani to celebrate Valentine's Day and were greeted by Molly (The Owner). The service was SUPERB and the food was to die for. Very great customer service and a cozy place. If you're looking for someone special in Grand Rapids, this is THE PLACE",5,Nash,Grand Rapids
"Bone marrow appetizer was cooked to perfection. A very nice surprise on the menu. We shared the Duck Two Ways, again cooked to perfection. Definitely worth a visit!",4,OpenTable Diner,London
Molly is always so pleasant! Arianna was an amazing server with great taste (helped us pick out cocktails and food)!! We love this place!,5,Moncu,Grand Rapids
"Great service and the food was good. We would have preferred the regular menu, but we knew going in that there was a special menu for Valentines Day.  All in all it was a great night out, and we would definitely dine here again.  As a side note, the Old Fashioned cocktail they served was one of the best I have had!",5,OpenTable Diner,Miami
"Dined at Divani for the Valentines Special Dinner. Warmly received and treated to a complimentary champagne toast. The waitress was prompt and very well informed and was a pleasure to talk to. The food was fantastic! The owner stopped by to chat and was open to constructive dialog, along with being charming and gracious. Dessert was over the top! A ""must return"" dining destination!",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"We went to Divani Valentine's weekend after finding very few places that would take a reservation. Unfortunately, my birthday falls 2 days before the big LOVE day. Divani did not disappoint! The food was absolutely delicious, we couldn't stop raving about it. Pricing is moderate - far less expensive than Chop House - but equally tasty. A few of us had the filet, it was amazing and the gouda mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts paired nicely. Service was also fantastic. Perfect birthday dinner!! I will definitely be returning!",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"The best burger by far, Divani really knows how to prepare them!",4,OpenTable Diner,Salt Lake City
Very friendly atmosphere. Divani was able to accommodate my vegan dietary requirements and my non-vegan companions.  Very beautiful interiors with gorgeous columns adorning the walls.  I will go here again.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"A group of us went to Divani before a concert at Van Andel, mostly because we could make a reservation. However, once we got there and got our food we were all so pleased I think it will become a staple before-concert choice for dinner and tasty drinks.",5,SarahK,Denver
"Amazing food! My husband and I made reservations here for our anniversary. We are so glad that we did! The ambience was perfect for date night. I ordered filet mignon and my husband had lamb chops. Both dishes had amazing flavor and wonderful side accompaniments. We had great wine, and great dessert. Service was top notch.",5,Jessica,Detroit
Salty good but great service!,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Great experience. We were a little early for our reservation, but were still seated promptly. I asked to switch the protein out in my meal for one of another dish on the menu and they did so without any problems. Our server was very friendly and personable.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Enjoyed the New Year's Dinner.  Will return to try everyday/dinner menu.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
the food and the service were great.  love it and would recommend for the future dining,5,JJLiu,Grand Rapids
Outstanding food &amp; service. Great location for special occasions!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Our favorite in Grand Rapids, always great.",5,AmyA,Grand Rapids
One of the best burgers I have ever had. The atmosphere was quint and the open door gave a nice breeze.  The chairs were very comfortable and the service was friendly and quick.  The places was much large than I first thought when we moved to a side room for paint nite after dinner.,5,MeShell,Grand Rapids
My daughter lives in GR but this was our first visit.  We dined on a busy Saturday. We had reservations for 2 and unexpectedly 2 more joined our party. I called the restaurant and they were able to add them to our reservation. A huge thank you to Molly!  The venue is beautiful and we had the front window seat which was an added bonus to our night. Our party had a wonderful meal and our server was superb!  We will be back!,5,cyancey,Detroit
"My husband and I were so full after the ""small plates"" of mussels and crab cakes that we split and entree of fall off the bone ribs! The wine list is very robust, it was the recommendation from Noah, our server, for the cab-franc that pleased my pallet.  We are in love with this place!",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"We went on a date to Bar Divani and had cocktails, small plates and salads. All were good but everything was brought tongue table at once, including the cocktails. To be clear-the cocktails were briughtboutbwithbthebsalada and small plates. We would have ordered wine with our meal but had no opportunity as we hadn't even had a chance to sip our lovely craft cocktails before the food came.",4,Fiasco,Grand Rapids
"The new menu items were delicious and we received attentive, skillful service.  Thank you for a lovely evening!",5,SherylK,Grand Rapids
"Small menu.  Well done ...did not like the appetizer so much.  Stuffed brie.  Not very original, but Ordered the risotto and burger. Very good.  Good waiter.",4,Jljr,Chicago
"Felt like they were trying too hard to be a gourmet food establishment vs. a wine bar.  Our server was great up until our food came, then he just disappeared.    When I flagged him down for our check he nodded, then just slid it across the table-  no words spoken.  It was just odd.  We were seated in a busy 'through-way' in recliner-type chairs.  We must have been a spectacle as everyone felt the need to stare as they walked through (seriously-  no less than 50+ people walked by!  They had a group party in the room next to us and left the door open for people to come and go.   The chairs made it somewhat uncomfortable to eat as well.  Oh well, we tried it and won't plan on going again.  If friends meet there, we will not object, but will not seek it out on our own.",3,RK5211,Grand Rapids
"This is a great place to go for a nice evening out!  Our waiter- Mike was a lot of fun. He made some great wine recommendations and accommodated dietary needs very well.  His  selections for food were fantastic rrcommendations!  The food menu is somewhat limited, but the food was delicious!",5,JBSB,Grand Rapids
Received an Open Table gift card so went on line to choose a restaurant. Very confusing... Only restaurants were in big cities far away from me. Looked closer and found one close to home. Fabulous dinner but they did not accept my gift card! I guess there is a difference between Open Table and gifts.opentable.com.  Still confused and spent money I wasn't planning on.,5,ouch,Grand Rapids
"Forgot to ask about fixed price for New Years Eve.  $60/pp seemed a bit steep as no complimentary glass of champagne was included, and you could purchase additional appetizers.  The main was very tasty--ate ever bit--hard to get asparagus that good. Husband's steak was not rare enough but good, and for $60 would have enjoyed two scallops rather than one--would have made the meal seem more generous.  Hint re dessert: if you buy pre made pie shells, at least crimp the edges to seem homemade (I do)  obviously not made by pastry chef--tacky...Martinis served table side nice touch but  skimpy on volume. Service excellent.  The front door remains a problem--huge shower curtain not keeping out cold &amp; crowded.  Not your problem but....     panhandlers are more aggressive than ever in the neighborhood day &amp; night, husband was followed to his car.  I am in the area 2x week (A.M.)&amp; trying to avoid panhandlers has become difficult &amp; this could hurt you--my husband won't come again.   Thanks for asking my opinion.",4,Gigi,Grand Rapids
"I love the restaurant. excellent food, service, and setting. It's one of my favorite downtown stops.",4,NWNW,Detroit
My fiance and I went there to pick up a wine order and to have dinner.  We both had the filet mignon and we're both very impressed.  My fiance also tried their red sangria which was probably the best sangria I have had to date.  Overall we had a very nice night.,5,Woogs,Detroit
"My friend and I enjoyed the brie, pork wontons and cornbread with jalapeno butter - all three were a delicious twist on classics. Wine list has a lot of great options - I enjoyed one of their featured red blends - $7 for a nice pour. My friend and I didn't totally understand the décor, but the ambiance was pleasant.",5,Kristi,Grand Rapids
"Great for meeting a group for ladies night out or for a romantic dinner for two.  Great ambiance, food,  and service!  They were also very patient with some of our group arriving late and didn't rush us.",5,judgestacy,Grand Rapids
I have been several times and it can be great or not so great. We went for nye and thought that was so so. They do well with presentation and ambiance.,3,Etreair,Chicago
WISH THAT THEY STILL HAD DUCK FAT FRIES AND CARRIED BARRISTA PINOTAGE,4,janays,Las Vegas
"The food was underwhelming...and the wine selection, though reasonably priced, was at best mediocre",1,Wendy,Detroit
"Haven't visited in a very long time.  Was invited for the great music Tuesday night.  We had great service, our server was very informative on the menu for food as well as drinks.  Was very disappointed in the menu selections.  We like to try a variety of different foods with different preparations but this just wasn't right for us. My dining partner was very unhappy with his selection of the wedge salad - too much cabbage - the hamburger not anything special.   I was pleased to see great gluten free selections including the shrimp and grits which was delicious.  I was quite surprised to hear a ""house-made"" burger would still contain gluten ingredients though.",2,dinnerandmusic,Detroit
"This is a great place to go.  Small menu,  but well put together.   A good selection of wines, with lots of wine by the glass.    It had been a while since we had been there.  We really missed the wine flights.  Flights take you on a journey and I hope they will bring them back.",4,rkridner2,Grand Rapids
Went during Artprize and our group of six was all pleasantly surprised. Food was a little different but all excellent. Will be back soon!,4,DaveK,Grand Rapids
Bar Divani has been a favorite of ours for years but lately it is starting to disappoint.  On this visit both the wine and food menu had shrunk in size and quality.  My daughter ordered the filet mignon and it was tasty though slightly overcooked.  I ordered the beet risotto and I couldn't eat it - it was that bad.  We both had a #1 martini which was like a margarita and very tasty to start.  But I ordered a glass of their house French Chardonnay with dinner and found it undrinkable.  I am really sad to write this review because I love that little neighborhood bar.  I hope they read these reviews and do something to improve.,3,GRfoodie,Detroit
We brought guest to Bar Divani for restaurant week special. The meals and service were excellent. I will absolutely go back.,4,DS1956,Detroit
We arrived on time do our reservation and were seated in an obscure corner table.  A server    not attend us for over 10 minutes.  We finally got water and menus and ordered appetizers immediately.  A further 20 minutes passed and we  did not receive drinks or starters.  Two large noisy parties were seated next to us and got all attention.  Music was boom-boom and annoying not in line with the upscale image they present on their website.  We left without ever receiving anything.,1,CTGR,Detroit
Wine was a bit pricey...food was great as well as service. Loved the atmosphere!,4,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"Bar Divani is the place for great food and wine, reasonably priced. We love this restaurant...and Rimple!",5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"I loved it. The food was amazing, the server helpful and the atmosphere comfortable. I wish it were non-smoking. The prices were excellent.",5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"Great food and atmosphere. Wine, beer, and liquor selection is extensive and impressive. Wait staff very helpful in selecting best wines. Small plates great for groups of people. We will be back",5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"The staff was very helpful, kind, and knowledgeable regarding the nuances of our food and drink selections. We were seated in a secluded area of the restaurant, which allowed us to take in the elegant atmosphere and still quietly share each other's company. We had a fantastic experience.",5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"On Valentine's Day, I wanted to make it special for my sweetheart and reserved a table for Bar-Divani. Upon entering, we were greeted with slow service and a difficulty to find our name on the list. Finally seated, it took forever for a server to present herself and the three course dinner options were scarce and trite. With a lack of pricing and options, it almost seemed like this restaurant did not want our business on this day. Our table was lacking a drink menu, the service was slow and the food tasted like it came from a soup can with a bit of celery and parsley sprinkled throughout. The bill was outrageous when compared to the lack of service and food that was prepared. Next time, we will not be spending our money at this wine bar.",3,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Our food was wonderful... great selections of wines and specialty cocktails... awesome happy hour menu with great deals. The only thing I wasn't ABSOLUTELY thrilled with was their french onion soup - it was a little too sweet for me.,5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"Everything about Bar Divani was outstanding. Wine was great, food was amazing and the service was sooo good. Would recommend it to anyone looking for a great experience downtown GR.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"This place was amazing. My girlfriend and I went for our one year anniversary. I told them it was our one year when I made the reservations. We were off in a small area by ourselves, very nice and romantic. When our waiter came up, the first thing he mentioned was our anniversary. Very personable. We had questions about the food and menu, and he answered all of our questions. The food was very good, especially for the price, good size portions too. For the two of us, our bill was only about $50, which was excellent for the setting and everything else. Most any other places like this, our bill would've been more. We were pleased with everything, and would for sure go back again.",5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Great Food and Service!! Make sure you order a small plate of their Moroccan Barbeque Ribs.This is the 2nd time my wife and I have had the joy of dining @ Bar Divani and we will go back each time we visit Grand Rapids. My wife enjoys their wine and I enjoy their whiskey. But we both enjoy the food and ambiance!! This is a spot that you could romantic dinner or entertain customers and enjoy both.,4,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"Our group meets monthly @ Louis Benton or 616 to discuss work.  We decided to try Bar Divani instead.  Unfortunately, it took more than 20 minutes for a server to come to our table and request our beverage request.  The server was only minimally knowledgable regarding wines but we were pleased that the ""head server"" arrived at our table to provide desired information. We were disappointed at the smoke apparent in our ""non-smoking"" section.  The actual food was wonderful but our experience was marred by sluggish service &amp; a palor of smoke from other patrons in close proximity to our table.  We would be unlikely to return unless we had some assurance that our service would be better.",3,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Food was okay...nothing to write home about.,2,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"I am extremely disappointed.  After calling the restaurant on Sunday they instructed me to contact your website for Reservations.  I do so and get my confirmation.  i show up with Customers for dinner at Bar Davani, only to see a sign closed for cleaning on October 6 &amp; 7.  I still have to contact the restaurant, but do not understand how this could happen.",1,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"Warm, comfortable environment with outstanding service from the waitress who was in training and he mentor. We had a reserved table near the front of the restaurant with big comfortable chairs (probably better for lounging and talking than eating dinner).  My partner enjoyed the extensive scotch menu and ask for something with a particular *flavor*.  He accepted two suggestions from our server which he thoroughly enjoyed and were exactly what he was looking for.  Since I think paint thinner and scotch could come from the same can, I enjoyed the chardonnay.  We shared several small plates, but my favorite was the duck stir fry - warm and flavorful.  We left knowing that we would be returning soon...",5,Susan,Detroit
"our dinner that we had at Bar Divani was terrific.  They have a chef's dinner of 3 small plate courses for 19.95 (29.95 with wine pairings).  this is a good deal in itself...but they also have a happy hour special before 7pm with buy one entree, get one free (and this includes the chef's dinner)  We had a great meal at a terrific price for the quality of the food.  we highly recommend the lamb riata and the duck terrine.  fabulous!!!",5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
not a good experience.  Sitting on a couch to eat a nice dinner is not my cup of tea.  They claim to have a great wine list but I was not impressed.  The server was not that great and it was a bad experience all around.  We will not be back. . .,1,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
"The food came out after almost an hour,  cold! Some of my party even had the wrong dish. The waiter decided that instead of fixing it he would argue with the whole table about it.   I asked for a manager.   The manager gave a free drink for my 30 dollar dinner being late, cold and completely over cooked.   Then I had to see another manager because the first one didn't even do what she said she would.   All-in-all It was an expensive mistake to go to Old Burdicks.",2,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Service was poor, we finally received silverware about 10 minutes after we got our food. The order was incorrect and we were never offered refills on drinks.",2,Jennifer,Grand Rapids
"The service and atmosphere were fine, but the food wasn't the greatest this visit. We have had good food here before, though. Tacos were nothing to brag about and were served with a ton of tortilla chips. Apps were good. Grilled cheese brussel sprout sandwich was good, but super salty; almost to the point where I couldn't eat it. The salads were ok. The food could be so much better!",3,sgbs,Chicago
"""I love the relaxed feel of this place – like a comfortable dining room in a friends home. I definitely would return to try more dishes.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"We celebrated our 2nd wedding anniversary on Saturday the 6th and had an amazing time. The food was delicious, the dessert was better than I could have hoped for and the service we received was absolutely outstanding. We don’t get to go out often, being a foster family, so to have such a special occasion feel so special from our service there, we truly fell in love and will dine there when we get to go out again. Thank you staff, cook and management for making our evening so incredible and memorable.",5,CGarman,Grand Rapids
"This was a great place for a low-key dinner on New Years Day.  The food was great and our server was friendly and helpful.  However, our initial impression when we first arrived was NOT positive.  The young man at the greeters' desk was not friendly and did not look us in the eye.  He appeared to be more concerned in directing his co-workers around, than in interacting with us.  This is clearly a training issue which should be addressed.",4,OpenTable Diner,Western NC
Visited again for the wife’s birthday.  Fish and Chips were excellent.  Wife had a filet mignon and it was excellent also.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
We enjoyed our meal. Service was a little slow and server was not knowledgeable about beers. Overall good experience.,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Great evening! Wonderful food. Great service. Look forward to returning in the near future!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Need more wait staff.... we waited 15 min for waters and another 15 for drinks,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Our server Sean was Awesome 👏🏿. He was very attentive and he had an overall fantastic attitude. He anticipated our every need.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Great service from Ali. Food was not good. Pulled pork tasted like it was frozen and reheated. Jerk chicken  also was very rubbery. Wings were ok. Overall not a good experience and certainly not a good value.,1,OpenTable Diner,Washington DC
"Went to grab a quick bite before the Lewis Black show at the State Theatre.   You can take the headache out of trying to find a parking spot by parking in the ramp and take the walkway into the Radisson.  Personally, I like the bustle of the place.   Definitely not your average hotel bar.  Good craft beer selection on tap.   The service and food were both solid.    Very unique split screen TV area for big time sports watching.  I noticed the prices a bit higher than the same fare at other places, probably reflecting the fact that it is a hotel bar/restaurant.   But based on the overall experience it was worth it.",4,Hals,Chicago
"Great! Service was quick, food was great. We had a blast!",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Great atmosphere in Kalamazoo, we really enjoyed having lunch here on a WMU game day.  The sweet potato fries are excellent.",4,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"Service was fantastic, I ordered the New York Strip and it had a good flavor, but it was a bit undercooked and it really wasn't a fantastic cut of meat. All-in-all it was an enjoyable experience but some of the pricing on the menu items is a bit steep for the quality.",4,Jourdan,Grand Rapids
Stopped in for Kalamazoo Restaurant Week. Enjoyed the special menu.,3,JacquleneR,Grand Rapids
Great place to eat with large variety of food choices.  Best onion rings I've ever had. Best wings I have had as well. Meagan was a great server. So thanks to her we enjoyed the experience.,5,luv2oodine,Columbus
We always eat here when we come visit our daughter at school. Great menu with tons of choices. Burgers are amazing. Steaks are just as good.,5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"I brought a few colleagues in to Burdick's for a business lunch, and everything was spot on.  The host was all over knowing we requested a quiet spot to meet, and easily accommodated us when our party grew by one.  Food was fantastic as usual, and our server was on point with minimal interruptions, but still able to give us stellar service throughout our meeting.  Amberly is always amazing and greeted us with a warm smile!  Thanks for a great lunch experience, we'll be back!",5,Alexa,Grand Rapids
"A couple of our orders were made wrong and the food was served like warm. Fries tasted like they had been sitting for a while before served. The server was not very attentive or apologetic to the mistakes they made with our orders. It was a bit disappointing. I normally love burdicks, but this visit was not up to their normal standards!",3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Took the family to dinner for mothers day. The whole family enjoyed the dinner. We had good service. The food was great!,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Very nice mother's day brunch. They included a flower for the mothers.,4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
It was very busy and loud tonight. Service was really slow compared to other times we've been there. Food was delicious though.,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"We went here for Prom and the food was perfect, but the spacing was very narrow and crunched together, our waitress wasn't very polite, and we made reservations a week in advance and they sat us at a table that was 2 seats short, so we had to crunch together even more around the table. I was not very happy at all and it wasn't very comfortable. It would be great for a date night or anniversary dinner but don't waste your time coming here with a large group. Parking also sucks, but that was expected.",2,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids

"We arrived earlier than our reservation but was able to be seated.  It was our anniversary so the staff greeted us and expressed congratulations to us.  We had a nice dinner and were staying at the Radisson, so it was nice to just return up to our room.  We also ate at the Burdicks breakfast buffet the next morning.  We actually had the same waitress and were wished a Happy Anniversary by staff again.  Very nice overall experience.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Tried the Siracusa fries, they were delishious. A nice counter point to my salmon BLT. The noise level was up the but not enough to discourage conversation at my table. Wait staff was helpful and quick.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"The food was good, but I missed the regular menu they normally have. They had a ""special"" menu for the valentine weekend. Service was a little slow but understandable for the valentines weekend.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids

"Used to frequent Burdicks when I lived in the area 15 yrs ago.  Restaurant is just as good now, as it was then.    Made a reservation on line via ""Open Table"", and was happy to see the option for flowers delivered to the table. It was the wife's birthday and I was traveling in from out of state.  We arrived 20 minutes early, and table was ready, with the flowers on it.  Food was delicious and well prepared.  For an upscale restaurant the prices were reason and portions were pretty good sized.  Large beer menu of local and state wide breweries.  All and all a great experience and value.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Made a mistake on my reservation, we actually needed seating for 8, and the staff took care of us without any problem.  We were there for the Lions game telecast, and I am not sure if they changed the ability to have the main large screen as one, instead they had it segmented, into four screens.  That was my only disappointment as I really like it when they use the big screen.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Arrived a little late for our reservation, however we were still seated within 10 minutes of arriving and everyone was extremely helpful and kind to us. Wonderful service staff!",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids

"Food was delicious, service was impeccable! Definitely recommend.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Where the food was very good and presentation of the food amazing, the service was VERY slow and we even lost our waitress for +20 minutes when all water glasses were empty.  It was frustrating to eat our meal without any drink to accompany.  This was a 70th birthday dinner for my Mom and we chose the restaurant for ambiance and chef qualities but were very disappointed in the attentiveness of our server, and the quickness of the food delivery.  The appetizer came very quickly -then we waited over an hour to get French Onion soup and had to ask for our check before finishing the meal to make a concert at DeVos.  We had 2.25 hours planned for the meal and we should have had MORE than enough time.  It wasn't the special environment we had hoped and my Mom was super frustrated with how loud the music was in the dining area.  The bar area seemed to be hopping so I decided this is not a place to go for a quiet and elegant dinner.",3,Christine,Grand Rapids
"This was our first visit to Divani's , but it will certainly be the first of many! From a warm greeting at the door, to outstanding service (thank you, Jordan!), to out-of-this-world food, Divani's has climbed to the top 3 of my dining experiences. I cannot recommend this spot too highly!!",5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Enjoyed the atmosphere and food. Staff very friendly.,5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit

We had a nice girls night out.  Davini came highly recommended by a friend and it didn’t disappoint.  Loved the mushroom risotto!,4,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"Went as a couple and had the New Year's eve limited menu. Food tasted pretty good. Ordered a medium steak that likely sat for some time because it was somewhat dry. Received all courses after two couples that arrived after us, which ended being pretty slow service. French Onion soup was a bit too sweet but wasn't bad. I would recommend the place, but this wasn't our best experience here.",3,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Great food ! Limited menu for NYE but I’m happy to go back and taste the main menu,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Wonderful food in a cozy atmosphere! My steak was just plain awesome!!!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Went for an anniversary dinner after looking at many other options in GR. The ambiance was perfect for a romantic dinner and the food did not disappoint. The kitchen is entirely from scratch which is helpful for my vegan diet as they were able to easily modify some dishes to accommodate (wild mushroom risotto!). My husband had the short ribs and enjoyed them a lot. Staff was helpful, attentive and super friendly. Definitely recommend.",5,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
"First time here with friends for a Christmas get together. Nice atmosphere, good food and drinks. Would go again.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"The server was Lizzie and she was great, timing was perfect. The food was very well presented and cook to perfection. Great drinks.",5,Allen,Grand Rapids
"Great Service, pricey drinks, food is subpar for the price point (as compared to Ruth Kris / Chop House).  Great ambiance.",3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"We had a wonderful meal and the dessert, it was the bomb!",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Had the Divani burger. Good burger, would give it an 7 out of 10. Server was super nice and very helpful. Atmosphere was pleasant, but maybe a bit louder than normal as they were very busy due to a concert nearby that evening. The only disappointment was the cocktail I had.  Ordered a candied apple drink and what I got was a total miss. Didn't taste anything like the description in the menu. I honestly don't think the bartender knew how to make it and just faked it.",4,RJ125,Detroit
"Went for a special night on an overnight trip to the city. The food at Divani was really good, and the drinks even better. The two negatives involved being seated next to the busy servers station where they imputed orders into a computer, etc., and the restaurant being understaffed for a very busy Friday night. Our server was terrific, but clearly stretched too thin to be truly attentive.",3,OpenTable Diner,Birmingham
"Our server Jordon was excellent! We love the staff at Divani, and Jordon is fitting in well! The place is simply the best, and it all starts with management that cares, Molly and her crew go above and beyond, every time, to ensure excellence!",5,Moncu,Grand Rapids
"We went here for date night with a reservation, although it still took about twenty minutes for us to be seated. It was the night of a show in Van Andel, so it was quite busy. The dining is presented nicely, although not necessarily worth the prices. Generally a good experience, but nothing outstanding.",4,Ciar,Grand Rapids
Our wine selection really accented the entrees that were quite fabulous. One of our favorite spots in Grand Rapids,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Husband and Wife date night without the kids. Wonderful experience.  Service was engaging, prompt, professional, friendly. Charcuterie, burger, lasagne were all original and DELICIOUS!  Really, DELICIOUS!!  Spent 2 hours in pleasant conversation, nice drinks, delicious and interesting cuisine.",5,OpenTable Diner,Seattle
"Very nice atmosphere: classy, quiet enough to talk.  High quality food, with an extensive wine list for pairing options.  Our server was helpful and professional.  They even offered free sparkling wine toasts on Sweetest Day.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"I feel like this place is trying to be more than it is.  When you walk in , the decor is nice and room spacious, and we were expecting a high class dining experience.  However, the menu is somewhat limited and the choices we made were fair at best.  My guest had the squid ink pasta, which she deemd, ""OK""  I fared a little better with the lasagna, but just slightly.  We started with the calamari, which was flash fried, but seemed soggy rather than crisp.   We later found out, overhearing the server at a table near us, there was a special, which we weren't told about and it actually sounded interesting.  Sad we weren't told that be our server.",2,Sensational,New York Area
"Pleasant place, good food. I had the quinoa salad and the burguer. I could say that’s not ordinary. Great textures, amazing flavor.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"For a sophisticated and friendly environment, nothing much better than Bar Divani.",5,Hobbs,New York Area
"The service was fantastic not overbearing and the Chef Jeff's plated creations were beyond flavorful, they were passionate!",5,cynvin,Chicago
"Food has been superb every time I've been. Menu constantly changes to reflect foods that are in season. Love the creative cocktails, especially during happy hour when they're practically half price. Good ambiance for a date night.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Excellent service. Fabulous scallops.,5,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
"Very nice room our server,Ariana , was very attentive.  Charcuterie way beyond expectations",5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Great find. Loved the friendly staff. Food was excellent. Different drink choices a plus.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Our food was fabulous! There were eight of us and each of us ordered something different. No one was disappointed. I had the shrimp and grits which were outstanding. The service was friendly and paced our dining experience at just the right time. They were happy to accommodate serving a birthday cake brought in from a bakery.,5,Jill,Grand Rapids
"Pre concert dinner It was a little hard to find., but well worth the extra walk!  Nice ambience. Awesome friendly service by Annalise. The Bloody Mary was wonderful. I highly recommend the brisket burger. It was beyond fabulous!  I would return in a minute!",5,OpenTable Diner,Northern MI
First time in Grand Rapids but definitely not my last thanks to a great experience from start to finish! The food was amazing (probably the best crème brûlée I've had in life!). Highly recommend! Arielle was so helpful with selections from bottle of wine to appetizers to things to check out in town! See you in a couple months!,5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"My husband and I love Divani! The atmosphere is upscale yet laid back, the service is wonderful, and the food is always great!",5,Susanna,Chicago
Amazing! Great birthday dinner with my lady!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"My husband and I recently ate at Divani for our first wedding anniversary and it was wonderful! The service was outstanding! Be prepared to spend a little more on your meal, however the food was amazing and it was worth every penny!",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Very attentive and knowledgeable wait staff made the tasty meal just that much more enjoyable.  Great variety of beverages, appetizers, and entrees.",5,Docdiner,Grand Rapids
"We had a wonderful evening at Divani during Restaurant Week Grand Rapids. We wanted to sit at the bar and the bartender was very friendly and appropriately accommodating. Highlights during dinner were the quinoa salad - so light, clean and crisp; the burger - the best we'd ever tasted - brisket roasted and then ground In-house - awesome texture &amp; flavor!; and the dark chocolate torte with raspberry purée - dense and drizzled with luscious berries.  The wine pairing with our meal was perfect. We especially loved the Pinot Noir by the glass.   This is a little gem of a place! Highly recommended!!",5,SallyZara,Detroit
"Food was excellent, Preston was a fabulous server!",5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"Great all around, food, service, menu, atmosphere, value",5,OpenTable Diner,Phoenix
"Our waiter, I believe his name was Preston was amazing and sweet.  It was our 7 year anniversary and he took care of our desert for the special occasion.  We go just about every big occasion and it worked out great- and he was very attentive and the food was amazing. The Cold-hearted drink was amazing and i get the same dinner just about every time- the rigatoni Bolognese is always good.  This time we splurged and got the appetizer as well and we remembered the Bruschetta to be amazing from the last time we were there.  Once again, thank you Preston!",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
The food was fantastic. The service was awesome.  We had the antipasti appetizer which was great.  Our food was hot and tasted wonderful. The best filet I ever had.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Very pleasant staff, superior service, above average Italian cuisine.  Try the pasta sampler, it is excellent value.",5,Titan65,Grand Rapids
"Bistro Bella Vita uses fresh, local, seasonal ingredients to create very beautiful dishes that are sensual in ever way. They are visually beautifully composed, they are balanced in flavor and texture, and the delight the tongue with flavor, aroma, and touch.",5,OpenTable Diner,Toronto
"Love the food, we have had many great meals at bistro Bella vita. Service was a little lower quality than we expect at this price point, but there was a HUGE birthday group next to us that our server was also covering.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Great food, small portions. Pricy for the quantity , but food was very good.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Bistro Bella Vita has always been one of our favorite spots - the food is always amazing, the service is always outstanding and the experience has always been a great one.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
great pizzas. Highly recommend the Mediterranean. Have been coming here for several years. always top notch service and food.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Was a very good for a 1 year anniversary dinner. We we would go for the most items and try fine dining. It is pricey spent over 100 for diner for 2, and wine. Very nice  restaurant.  Would for a fine date night.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"We were seated in the bar area, something that in retrospect, I should have asked to be changed.  Had made reservations a month in advance via Open Table.  Made the dining experience very noisy, as a Michigan game was on TV.  Waiter was great, attentive, handling a bad plate of food well, efficiently, and with a smile. The return plate wasn't much better, but it was more edible than the previous. I have been to this place many times before and really enjoyed it, not so much this time.",2,key201,Detroit
"Even though I felt as if my seafood soup was priced well, I truly dislike my Moscow mule drink and was upset I would have to pay for that.  My friends got spaghetti and ravioloi and price was way too high for that.",2,Marisa6,Grand Rapids
"Our party of three dined on sea bass, chicken and brisket, excellent meals all with fine service and lively ambiance.  The manhattan cocktail was superb and dessert portions just enough to top off a very fine dinner.  Looking forward to our next visit to Grand Rapids to dine there again.",4,guysnight,Detroit
Had a very great first experience and will be coming back to enjoy the great food and atmosphere soon again. Thank you.,5,JoshawaKushWalker,Grand Rapids
"We enjoyed our food and the atmosphere of the place. Unfortunately there was a very loud and obnoxious drunk fellow holding court at the table next to us. In addition, someone else at the same table kept playing an iPad for her child which drowned out conversation. We have no problem with bringing young children to restaurants. After all, this is how they learn to appreciate these experiences. It doesn't seem like using loud music to sooth a fussy child is the most considerate way to go.",4,ckbnola,Detroit
"The food was very good.  Service was quick - for a dinner during rush time we were in and out within an hour.  I think servers are more inclined to be more attentive to tables that order drinks, appetizers, dinner and dessert.  Anything less is a quick turn table.  Also - first description indicated it was more Mediterranean - but actually Italian.",4,OpenTable Diner,Washington DC
"The service was excellent, the food almost so.  I ordered the spaghetti with lobster and shrimp.  The dish came out with a very starchy taste to the pasta.  It was inedible.  The server agreed to have them take it back and make another.  The second time it was much better and loaded with seafood.  The others had the duck leg and gnocchi which they enjoyed very much.  The Wine and Beer selections were excellent as well.  Being in Grand Rapids a craft beer list like this is a must.",4,MichFrog,Grand Rapids
"From the moment we walked in to the moment we left this restaurant exemplified everything we believe defines a extraordinary dining experience. Very well done Italian, over the top service. Felt bad when I realized I only tipped our server 30%. He was better than that.",5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
The food was very good but there was way too much noise.  It was hard to carry on a conversation with the person sitting right across the table.,4,JudyP,New York Area
Make sure waiters (Mike) are less awkward. It makes for a creepy experience on a first date.,4,ScottFeezy,Grand Rapids
Great service the restaurant was busy but our order came out quick and hot.,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Great business lunch.  Food was delicious and the service was fantastic.,5,npratt78,Grand Rapids

Awesome food and outstanding service. Always a great meal. Never disappointed and always happy!,5,Mainlander,Northern MI
"Great as always!  Can't say much more, but if you have been there before, you know exactly what I mean.  Then if you haven't, it is a must try.  Local foods, great tastes, handmade pasta, wonderful combinations &amp; creations.  Truly a foodie paradise!",5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Always a great meal and atmosphere with excellent service.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Always a great place to eat. Had pizza this trip and it was as usual the best ever.  Bistro never disappoints,5,luv2eat,Detroit
Dinner at Bistro was once again fabulous!!!,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Food was quite good but the menu seems a bit limited.,3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
First time visit. Excellent experience. Duck ravioli and spaghetti Diavlo were fantastic. Excellent service from Preston.,5,Mike,Chicago
The service was exemplary and the food was terrific! We enjoyed ourselves immensely!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"This was the poorest dining experience we have ever had....and, believe it or not we are not complainers.......The noise level was so loud we could not talk...had to move to the bar area...very dark so the waitress turned up the lights....both couples split our meals...small eaters....our pasta was not cooked thru, and the portion was very small, the other couple said the brisket had a lot of fat...not edible....our beet salads were very small and dry, two chips of a dry golden beet....no bread with meal....had to order separate....our waitress never came back to our table....had to ask someone to get her......this was a birthday celebration, so it was disappointing to have such a bad experience......way overpriced $140.00 including our$20.00 tip  for two split meals........",1,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
I have been there four times and the food was always amazing.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Odd to charge for bread? But food is always first rate.,4,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Flavorful and inventive food!,5,OpenTable Diner,Charleston
Good food and great service.,5,Luv2dineout,Grand Rapids
"Good food, good service, great atmosphere, but the portion of duck ravioli was very small; not nearly enough food for my husband. The other pasta plates I saw seemed to be much more sizeable, so this was disappointing.",4,GJ13,Chicago
It was a delightful evening with friends. The waitress made excellent suggestions from the menu and all of the food came out perfectly. It is on the pricey side but the food and experience is worth the price.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"The structure of the interior was eye catching, the service was flawless and the food was simply amazing!  We will be back!!",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"An excellent dining experience. Quality crafted food and wine, with great service. The dining room is always sparkling and comfortable for any casual or business attire.  Schedule your next meal here and you won’t be disappointed.",5,OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 3, 2018"
It  is wonderful place to take business guests and know you will have a great dining experience in a conducive atmosphere.,5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"We dined at the State Room prior to a basketball game. The atmosphere was quite lively, crowded, and fun. The servers were on the run! And, everyone was happy.",4,metrobill,Detroit
"For the second time now we decided to celebrate a special occasion at the State Room. While the venue is great the food was again very disappointing. The Salmon was tasteless, the Tofu had no flavor and the steak was mediocore at best. Appetizers and dairy store ice cream were the highlights of the meal. High price and low flavor twice in a row. We will be crossing this one off of our list.",2,Stephen,Detroit
"The State Room was a great restaurant! The food was wonderful, the service was great and the ambiance was lovely. I would recommend it to everyone and will definitely be returning.",5,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
Had the scallop dinner.  I wasn’t crazy about the sauce.  My daughter really enjoyed her Vegan selection however.  Service was very good.  Price was OK,3,OpenTable Diner,Naples
The food was wonderful.  The presentation was magnificent.  Thank you for giving us an experience we shall always treasure.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"We reserved a table for a mid-week dinner prior to a show at the Wharton Center and were very pleased with our meal. A craft cocktail was too ambitious, and when I told our waiter that I didn't like it and could I please exchange it for another, plainer drink, he was most obliging. On his recommendation, my husband tried a new fish entree and said it was delicious, my trout was wonderful, and the asparagus served with it was cooked perfectly! Parking in the attached structure was very convenient. This is our go to spot in East Lansing!",5,Swindi,Detroit
Enjoyed the whole affair.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"always good food and service here.  also nice ambience and not as noisy as many restaurants.  Had to pay for parking before MSU basketball game though, which I haven't had to do in the past??",5,nice,Toronto
Great service and food.,5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"When making my reservation, I specified we were celebrating my husband's birthday, and once we were seated, our waitress acknowledged this and wished my husband ""happy birthday!"" Nice! EVERYTHING  in each course was tasty, well prepared, good portions, and a special request was honored. The waitress was patient, made suggestions, friendly and efficient. I had read some reviews that mentioned a boring, ""institutional"" atmosphere, but we found it to be cozy, comfortable, fun vibe, actually classy...nothing as the reviews described. Right down to our MSU Dairy-made ice cream dessert, the meal was a perfect way to celebrate my Spartan husband's birthday and a Spartan homecoming football game win!",5,RebeccaS,Richmond
I believe the above review is accurate.  Those working in the restaurant were stressed by an event in the Big 10 room.  There were many LOUD folks in the bar area who were drinking as a prequel to the event bars opening. Food was OK but expected better.  Much was overcooked (I think influenced by event stress in kitchen area and on wait staff).,4,AlBie,Grand Rapids
"Late lunch with a friend in celebration of his college graduation accomplishment.  Early in the week. Place was quiet and slow-paced.  Food was really good and very tasty.  However, not a huge selection on the lunch menu.  Dessert here is almost always good! As is their wines/spirits. Good for families. Great for a gathering of friends.  I believe dinner is better than their lunch menu, but their lunch is not horrible.  I will visit again as the atmosphere is quite nice.",4,Rabiden,Grand Rapids
"This is a hard review.  My meal was excellent - I had the brussel sprouts starter - on a very awkward plate, but good, if a little salty.  My main - the scallops - fairly amazing - along with the farm fresh veggies.  My MSU sophmore has a palate unready for butternut squash ravioli (he declared OK).  I do share his opinion on the salmon - bland, bland bland.  His veggies were kind of overcooked as well.  My MSU freshman smartly ordered the Kobe Beef Burger and declared it excellent.  I ate some of his very excellent fries.  My future MSU son ordered the brisket starter - bland he said, and the parparadelle main - bland he also declared.  I ate a little of his main and I see his point, but it was generally fine.  I think this is an adult sort of restaurant and you should probably steer MSU parents to more young adult fare.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
This was a great place to go for a Friday night dinner. Food was wonderful only topped by the service.,5,Qqqqqqqqwqqqqq,Chicago
We always love eating on campus. Entire service team is welcoming. Food is delicious!!,5,Dawnnis8,Pittsburgh

"Delicious meal, very good service. Highly recommended, the filet was the best we've found in the area.",5,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
Excellent food-- especially the seafood. Even the sides were remarkably well paired and well done. Overall a really lovely experience and evening-- especially excellent during the summer when the restaurant isn't as busy.,5,Ani8,Detroit
"We took advantage of a Groupon,  Half priced bottle of wine on Thursdays  and The State Room's Dine Under the Stars  Thursday special. Really there are no stars since it is too early but sitting outside with live jazz music and people watching was fabulous. No sun on that side of the building and the breeze made it very pleasant.   I realize it would be a huge undertaking to offer that  patio dining every day of the week but what a great concept.   It was the perfect date night for my husband and I.  Our server was Kristen  and she did a great job!",5,PugMomma,Chicago
"Great food choices, good service,  and convenient.  Highly recommend the filet, sea bass minus the sauce, shrimp small plate, lobster bisque minus the croquette,  and blueberry pancakes.",5,Liz1,Chicago
"Stayed at the hotel, food was very well prepared and service was excellent",4,mdl57,Washington DC
The bartender was ignoring our group at the bar. This was our first time having cocktails.,2,Aeagleguy,Detroit

"The scallops were delicious; however, they were maybe lukewarm.",3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"The ambiance at MSU State Room was Excellant, the service impeccable, and the food amazing! The only disappointment for me was they did not know how to make my favorite drink...Keoke Coffee!",5,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
The State Room was a pleasant surprise. The food is top notch at a surprisingly affordable price. My steak was tender and juicy. My wife enjoyed her fish as well.,5,Ancient123,Chicago
Loved breakfast did not like the last two times we had lunch there  Kyle was an excellent server !!!,4,Meme,Greensboro
"The food was superbly prepared.  Although the price is a bit high, the quality of the food is well worth it.  I don't like over paying for food, but felt like this meal was worth the price we paid.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Service and food were exceptional!!    We are already planning our next visit!,5,Kat007,Detroit
"Food, presentation and ambincrease were great.  Good value as well.  Only disappointing point was the food was only lukewarm when served.  No cover was on the food for bringing into the dining area, so it may have cooled upon delivery.  Other servers had the metal covers on the entrees when presenting.  Jordan did not have them, and it may have caused the entrees to cool.",4,McD3,Detroit
"Really disappointed with the chicken sandwich it was very plain, the green go ham and cheese we ordered had a Smokie taste to the ham on plain bread toasted with oil was not even worth a second bite. The Asian noodle bowl was very tasteless ! The server took off 3.00 total and the meals were basically not touched.  The dining room is decorated nicely",2,Meme,Greensboro
"Our Server was perfect! Attentive and knowledgeable. Food was good, above-average. Not as spectacular as I'd hoped. Limited menu for lunch, it seemed.",5,Rabiden,Grand Rapids
Wonderful as always!  I'm so happy my son goes to MSU so we got to know this place!,5,Foodie,Detroit
"Our first time dining at this local gem. Menu was full of healthy choices. Our food was prepared with expertise and beautifully presented. We felt we paid a fair price and truly enjoyed the friendly, attentive service. Bravo State Room!  We will definitely visit again.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Service was very slow at first but did improve as the night went in. Several things we ordered they were out of. Overall disappointing for the price point.,3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Out of town people (1.5 hr drive) haven't dined here for a number of years (~10 yrs) but remembered it as being a wonderful place to dine. Was not disappointed. Celebrating 51 years of marriage with dinner &amp; theater (Cabaret @ the Wharton).  Well populated for a Wednesday, moderate background noise level, able to carry a quiet conversation with my wife. Ambience subtle and eclectic making for perfect dining experience. Sarah our server was excellent as was the meal.  Menu was delightfully varied (always makes choosing difficult but rewarding) and well sourced with local products. Timing was excellent, never rushed, never waiting (dining time 1.5+ hours). Go Green, Go White",5,GregLaura,Detroit
We sat outside on a beautiful night. Outside seating was preferred by use and it was great. Other couples in the table next to use didn't care for the Sun.  The food was fantastic and the choices were good.,5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"We have dined here on several occasions and have always been impressed with the food, service and ambiance. One can never go wrong when choosing Bistro Bella Vita before any concert or show, either, because they make sure your meal is out on time so you don't have to rush to your event. Bravo again, Bistro Bella Vita!!",5,GRdiner,Grand Rapids
"The service and food were both incredible!  We ordered the calamari for an appetizer and then split the brisket for our dinner. The beef brisket was so tender and so delicious. There was plenty for two people. The calamari was great, as well. We don't live in Grand Rapids, but I can't wait to return there to go to Bisto Bella Vita again!!",5,cjofood,Detroit
"We made a reservation two days before our visit. When we arrived, the restaurant was not full. We were seated by the kitchen. It was terrible. When we left, there were still many tables available. Food was ver good, server was very attentive. Unfortunately should we ever go back to Grand Rapids, we will never go back to this establishment. People who walked in off the street had better seating than my husband and I. Shame on them.",5,LJC1,Cleveland
Love Bistro food is always amazing good variety of wine or any cocktails. We had friends visiting from Texas they loved it,5,MimozaR,Northern MI
The concierge recommended Bistro Bella Vita and it was a good choice.  Our server was friendly and helpful as we made menu selections.  The Fisherman's Stew was outstanding.  The Pork Chop was huge.  We were too full to have dessert but saw some of the options and they looked delicious.,4,WineO,Dallas
"Prompt seating. Comfortable table. Prompt, courteous service. Pasta Tasting plus wine pairing simple but satisfying. Waiter friendly and patient during busy period.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago

Loved it! Would highly recommend it!,5,Foodie,Las Vegas
"The atmosphere was very loud had a hard time conversing with my wife. The wait staff was very friendly and did an amazing job. However, some of the staff seemed to be ""running"" past my table frequently, which made it hard to relax. Furthermore, I looked on line for a romantic place to take my wife for a birthday dinner, I would not take her here again for that purpose. The food was amazing, hats off to the chefs. I would visit the restaurant again but only if I were to bring a large group.",2,KevinN,Grand Rapids
"The food here is never a let-down. They always do a fantastic job with service also - no matter if you have a table of 2, or a room of 30. I never walk away disappointed.",5,StacieF,Grand Rapids
The margarita pizza was delicious. Our waitress took very good care of us. I would definitely recommend BBV!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"AWESOME food. The best we've had at a restaurant ever, I think. Great atmosphere, cool character. A bit pricier than our norm but we'll be back for special occasions for sure. One of our meals came with something on it that we asked to have removed and they happily corrected their mistake and treated us to a free dessert for the inconvenience which was also top-notch delicious.",5,AlexK,Grand Rapids
Visited here twice during a recent a business trip to Grand Rapids.  Once for lunch and once for a light dinner.  Food was outstanding both times and I look forward to going back to try even more menu items.  Highly recommend!,5,OnTheRoadAgain57,Naples
Service is always spot one. The best in G.R.  Essence Group restaurants are the best overall in G.R. for service and food quality.  Dinner was perfect.  We have never been disappointed.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"The setting was quite nice, the staff very friendly and accommodating, and the food delicious. I loved my meal, though it really upset my stomach, but I'm guessing that's because my pasta sauce was so rich (it tasted amazing). I had asked for a nice table for a special occasion for 2; they gave us a table for 4, a vase of flowers, and didn't put anyone by us, which was quite nice. I saw a few large groups come in, and despite it not being very busy, was still kind of loud. I found it kind of strange that our table was kind out in the open, right by the entrance, so it wasn't very private. But, I hadn't asked for private, nor did I mention it was for a date, so I'm still quite pleased. I loved my first experience and can't wait to go back!",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Delicious arugula salad and duck ravioli!  Not as loud on outside deck.  Very nice wine list.  Excellent service!  So glad they had valet parking!,5,Shep,Grand Rapids
Gnocchi was good.  Was not impressed at all with paella - too much chorizo and not enough flavor.,3,LynnP,Grand Rapids
"We've been many times, but not in quite some time. This experience was disappointing. 1) The food presentation was careless. We ordered three appetizers, and all looked thrown together. 2) The server seemed to guess when we asked what was on the antipasti plate. No mention of the local origin of the cheeses and meats, etc. 3) The wine presentation was awkward.  Our bill was around $400, which is typical for a business dinner for us. However, the treatment, the food quality and the service were not on par with our expectations.",2,SueT,Detroit
"I had made a reservation at Bistro Bella Vita to celebrate my partners birthday. I explained to them how my partner and I were moving states a while to pursue career goals etc.  I told them I really wanted to make her birthday special. I told them her favorite dessert. A warm apple crostata with vanilla bean gelato. I never heard anything back so I assumed they just didn't have time. I was proven SO wrong. We came in, were greeted like old friends and taken to a table with an extra special set up. They brought u s a small bouquet and lined the tables with eloquent linen. Everything during the meal was delicious.  We were just about to ask for a dessert menu when our server asked us if we were ready for the crostata. My partners eyes lit up like the fourth of july. We loved it so much and are so thankful you gave us this experience. We will always come back to celebrate. Thank you Bistro Bella Vita.",5,AlexV,Grand Rapids
"This was one of the best restaurant experiences we've ever had.  The staff was on point with being visible and attentive without being overbearing or hovering.  Drinks were refilled quickly, empty plates disappeared immediately, the kitchen was efficient at preparing very flavorful and properly prepared food in a timely manner, and the atmosphere was pleasant and conducive to an enjoyable conversation without straining to hear or speaking up.  The paella was fantastic, as was my wife's gnocchi,  and they had mocktails for those who aren't able to have alcohol (pregnant or driving, etc.) but want something more than water or tea.  We will definitely come back to Bistro Bella Vita!",5,BrianW,Grand Rapids
Still one of our favorite places in GR.  Very few times are we disappointed.,5,MichaelF,Chicago
"My wife and celebrated our 18th anniversary. We both had menu items picked, and based on our selections our waiter suggested specials that we might enjoy. We selected the specials and were not disappointed! Try the carrot cake - absolutely incredible!",5,KeithJ,Grand Rapids
"Another outstanding meal at Bistro Bell Vita!  My wife and I eat a gluten free diet, on this visit we tried started with a chopped salad and moved on to the Cassoulet and the Paella.  Both dishes were outstanding and did not lack anything by being gluten free.  The drinks were excellent and the service was great.  We will definitely return soon.",5,PaulT,Grand Rapids
I have been there a few times now and I have never had anything that I didn't like. The quality of the food is very good and service is great as well. The main meal portions are perfect in size although I wish that I could say the same about the appetizer portions which I feel are a bit small for what you pay for. Be sure to make room for dessert as they are very tasty (I love the tiramisu and the creme brûlée).,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"My husband and I were vacationing in the Grand Rapids area and had dinner at Bistro Bella Vista twice. We both loved it. The food is delicious, the servers excellent and attentive. We liked the atmosphere and decor, too. My favorite meal was the duck ravioli - incredible!  Altogether one of the best restaurants we have ever experienced.",5,antiqueme,Chicago
Bistro Bella Vita is a great place for special occasions or everyday dining. The food is always great! They cater to food allergies and sensitivities so I am always sure the food will taste great and also be good for me and my father who also has food intolerances. My husband who can eat everything also loves the food here. It is our go to place in GR when dining out! Great ambience! Great wait staff! Fabulous chefs!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"The food was really good.  Our issue was for the price the portion size was rather small - seemed like a lunch portion at a dinner price.  We have eaten here a few times and this is the first time we were saddened by the small portions.  We are hoping that it was just an off day because it was Father's Day and getting busy.   We will go back, for sure.  Wait staff is wonderful and the food was well prepared flavor wise.",3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Food was delicious!  My two dining partners and I all ordered something different. All dishes were well prepared and delightful.,4,JudyS,Grand Rapids
We were extremely satisfied . The service was excellent.  Our waiter was more than helpful  and the serving staff as a whole was truly professional and added  to a relaxed and enjoyable dinner. The most difficult part of the evening was deciding on what gem to choose from the menu. The Tajine was delicious.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Food was very good....but Expensive!  We arrived before 6pm. By 7:15 the noise level was quite high.  But our waiter, Brian, was WONDERFUL and very helpful when we realized we were running late for our show at the Civic Theater.",4,susanp,Grand Rapids
"Great food, great service! This was the second sit there and I have to say it was even better than the first.  There were three in our group. Everyone ordered something different and each of us enjoyed every bite. Well prepared, good portions. The service was excellent. The server was attentive but not intrusive. Everything was timely and he anticipated our needs. Never once had to ask for anything. Definitely will go back. Strongly recommend to anyone looking for a great experience in downtown.",5,OpenTable Diner,Springfield
It wasn't horrible but it was very loud and I got the mushroom ravioli and I only got like 5 ravioli in my meal and it was 20+ dollars for them they were not that good.  I think I would have like going to the Olive Garden better,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Great service and food for our anniversary dinner. A little pricy but for a special event night it was worth the price. Great setting, staff, and food!",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Excellent Paella and prepared the way I prefer.,5,PattiS,Grand Rapids
Great menu with unique and delicious food selections...and really good service.   Not too noisy.  Great overall experience!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
The entree doesn't come with a soup or salad to start so be prepared to pay $6 or more for a salad on top of the appetizer cost and entree costs.  Very expensive for just a filet mignon that tasted like every other cheap restaurants (i.e. Applebees &amp; Texas Corral) filet.  The beef brisket was mostly fat but comes looking huge.  The potatoes were homemade and outstanding.  This coming from a person who will not eat fake potatoes and always have to order a baked potato to get a real one.  Service was outstanding too!! They had designated employees to walk around and no joke as soon as you are done with your last bite they scoop your dishes away so you don't have them messing up your table.  OCD didn't kick in once!,3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Preston was the best waiter ever! The food is great but I always believe these ice can make it excellent - would def go back!,4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
The food was delivered in a timely fashion. Wine suggestions parred well with our entries . We both felt welcomed and appreciated for choosing to dine @ the Bistro.,5,OpenTable Diner,France
"Shrimp appetizer over-fried, beef tournedos nothing special.  Wine was excellent.",3,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"Great combination of food quality, menu, price, service and atmosphere; one of our all time favorite places. Bill, the General Manager is very ""hands on"" and visible. He engages with the clientele in a very open and comfortable way.",5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Our son attends MSU and we discovered Dustys his freshman year . We love it and always include a family meal at Dustys on each visit ! Wine store is really great as well .  Great steaks !,5,OpenTable Diner,Columbus
Very good food and service,5,Disappointed,San Diego
Food is excellent.  Ask for Avery as your server.  She’s fantastic!,5,OpenTable Diner,London
Good selection of choices on each dining course from start to finish.  Food was all very good.  Restaurant staff was amiable and attentive.,5,Herpper,Detroit
Lovely small quiet reliable upscale restaurant. Can count on it for a special event! Stayed for several hours and had a leisurely catch up with friends. Never rushed. Everyone was happy with their meal.,4,Michigander,Chicago
Great wine selection. We had the mussels as our shared main course- plenty to eat and delicious.,5,Diner19,Columbus
This was a great lunch celebrating a special event. The host sat us at our favorite table. I tried two dishes I hadn't had before and loved them. Curry butternut squash soup perfect for cold Michigan days and chopped salad.,5,DeborahG,Detroit
Great meal!  Will come back next time we are in Lansing.,5,OpenTable Diner,Milwaukee
"neighbors(Seniors) wanting to get together for lunch at somewhere ""different"" with good food and moderate pricing, I suggested Dusty's.  I have been coming to Dusty's for a long time; lunch, dinner and Brunch, which is a popular event for me.  My grown family also enjoys Dusty's and we often decide to meet here with family members who are in town for business or other occasions.  Dusty's is a restaurant that we feel can be counted on for a good meal no matter what the occasion.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Excellent food and wine list.  Ambiance very nice.  Service very good.  Attached Wine store had very good selection.  Highly recommend.,4,Northshorefood,Chicago
"Always a great meal and very nice decor. GM is the best host, and meals are well made with local fresh fare.",4,Andra,Detroit
"Outstanding service, the special plate they did for our anniversary was amazing, raspberry sauce was to dye for.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"When we get to Okemos, we typically head to Dusty's. The food is consistent -- always good. The tournedos were cooked to perfection. Very nice wine list -- reasonably priced. Service -- always reliable. I really can't speak to many other dishes since I always get the tournedos....love it.",5,Breckski,Pittsburgh
Always a great place to go.  Very quiet on a Sunday night.,4,SouthernSparty,Charleston
"Not a good restaurant choice if you want quiet conversation over dinner. On a very positive note, we had excellent crab cakes, whitefish and salmon!",4,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
Food was fabulous as always! Service however was not! The restaurant was not busy maybe 4 tables with guests. No excuse for unattentive service. Our meal was served and the server never checked back to see how dinner was. We finished eating and another waiter walking toward the kitchen stopped and picked up our plates. He was awesome! We were seated near the kitchen so I could see our server standing in the kitchen talking. She had no personality and said very few words. My husband thought it was odd and so did I. We love Dusty's and the lack of attentive service is nothing we have ever experienced at this wonderful restaurant.,4,Luvgreatfood,Grand Rapids
"My husband and I starting working at dustys 30 years ago, as a waitress and a bartender. This year we celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary. We wanted to go back to a place that we shared allot of fun memories. We were so glad we chose Dusty's. We had a cheese fondue appetizer, and it was every bit the way I remembered it. I also had the pecan crusted whitefish, which melted in my mouth. We were so full for desert,  so we drove back the next morning to get napoleons. I can't tell you how many times I thought of that flaky crust and amazing creme layers. I remembered the trays that use to be made of them when I first started there 30 years ago, and they did not disapoint. We will be back again soon, and this time will not wait so long to do so.  Thanks Matt and team for your hospitality.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
The scallops were outstanding!,3,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Great place to celebrate birthday!,5,MarieS,Grand Rapids
This place serves a fantastic filet mignon!,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Dusty's is always amazing! Their menu is always an eclectic collection of amazing dishes.  A wonderful romantic restaurant with amazing food!!!,5,OpenTable Diner,Tampa
The food was good and reasonably priced. The service was excellent,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Dusty's is a consistently good place to eat. The wait staff is attentive and the food is good as well as good value for the money.  There are options, too, if you  are gluten free or vegetarian. Overall, a really good dining experience when you're out with friends of on business.",4,marge,Grand Rapids
Our wait person was fantastic. Food was very good. They have a fresh tomato salad that was very good.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"I had the roast duck on the recommendation of the waiter. Duck is so easy to overcook but what I was served was done to perfection! I couldn't have been more pleased with the selection.  My waiter went the extra mile, as well. Service was wonderful. Thank you,",5,OpenTable Diner,Boise
"We don't get to the Lansing area that often but when we do, we try to carve out time to dine at dusty's. we started with the frites. The combination of garlic confit and garlic aioli made them garlic-ly delicious. The filet, potato croquettes and fondue spinach made for a great main course. The strawberry panne cotta was the perfect light desert finish.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Food and service were stellar.  Bar looked closed due to inadequate lighting.,4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
It was phenomenal. Seriously great meal and presentation.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Sunday brunch was very enjoyable!  The brunch menu included just a few specials, but our selections were well prepared, as were the cocktails.   To start, I chose the Bellini Martini, a perfect brunch drink.  One of my tablemates chose the Mimosa, and while tasty, it was the smallest Mimosa we had ever seen! My brunch consisted of two small crab cakes, each topped with a perfectly cooked poached egg and served with a couple of sauces and several pieces of bacon (which in my opinion were totally unnecessary).   My tablemates each got the ""hash"", which they seemed to enjoy, but not as enthusiastically! The restaurant was not very busy this holiday weekend, but the server was quietly attentive to our needs.  Our coffee cups and water glasses were always filled!   The reader should understand, that when it comes to Dusty's, locals set a very high bar for performance--and Dusty's rarely disappoints.",5,EllieM,Grand Rapids
"Ok, so this place isn't a recommendation of mine and I would say just pick someplace else. Food wasn't good, especially for the cost. Service was just like any bar or dinner and ambience is old. Mediocre food quality.",3,Time4Wine,Chicago
"Cold waffles, rubbery omelettes.",1,OpenTable Diner,Cincinnati
"My husband and I went to Dustys to celebrate our 48th wedding anniversary. It was quite easy to make a reservation for dinner online.  There was a large graduation party on the porch in front, but we enjoyed a quiet, pleasant dinner in the dining room.  The potato bacon soup and field greens salad were tasty. We both had beef; my tournedo could not have been more tender and Tom enjoyed the pub steak.  We could not comfortably order dessert, so our server dressed up the usual brownie bites with whipped cream and white chocolate. It was a very special evening.",5,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
"We've been there many times, but this time the food was a bit off. Wondering if they got a new chef.",4,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Dusty's has lost that special something that lured you back time and again. The food quality has become inconsistent and some menu choices don't make sense for the area. Drinks also are inconsistent and generally unimaginative. Stick with wine rather than cocktails and you'll enjoy yourself more.,4,Sparty,Chicago
Great food and wine. We celebrated our 7th anniversary and it was everything we expected.  Great atmosphere and top-notch service.  Will go back again!,5,OpenTable Diner,Washington DC
"I've been to Dusty's before and always enjoyed their food. However, their Mother's Day brunch was bland and ordinary - absolutely nothing worth noting. I would not recommend going for a special occasion.",3,Disappointed,New York Area
Dined here over 30 times but ... Last two visits here were a disappointment not sure if we had a different chef but the food preparation was definitely a change for the worse,2,Meme,Greensboro
"Excellent service, went above and beyond what a normal staff would do. An extensive wine list, sure to please anyone. Food was delightful and filling (no small portions here)!",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"The server was very good but seemed hurried the dining room was very  nice,quiet and comfortable. But I have 1 complaint and 1 suggestion. The suggestion is for me personally I dont like mashed potatoes.You had no rice,no baked potato  or wedges to substitute the mashed potato.The complaint is I drink Red Breast whiskey at home as my stable. What I was served was not redbreast.It burned and was harsh After years drinking it I know the smell and taste.I was told it was Red Breast but that was not correct.It would have been simpler to say you where out.",3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Delicious food, great view.  We will return!",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
I love the Bistro when I want to have good quality conversation - in the Bar Area where the acoustics are good.  The waitress was good - very accommodating.  Sam was dear to greet us and visit us.   It is convenient - easy parking - and just comfy.,5,Pearl,Chicago
"New Year's was a busy night at the restaurant but the staff was wonderful. Very good service.  The food was delicious - it was a special menu.  Dessert was good, too!  We'll be back!",4,LeeB,Chicago
Food was very good for vegetarians!  Best in the area.,5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"I was at this restaurant last week and to be honest, the food and service was a lot better. Probably won't be back for awhile.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Lovely quiet dinner Friday evening.  Soloist playing in the bar area was a nice backdrop, we could still have a conversation but enjoy the music.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
The Bistro is always my number 1 restaurant in St. Joe.  Always a delight and a perfect place to share great food with friends or alone.,5,Lizzzzzzz,Chicago
Everything we had was delicious.,5,CanadianMatt81,Chicago
Waitress was mediocre. Caesar salad was boring.  Asked for dinner salad and got entree salad. Shrimp cocktail was good!,3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Have always enjoyed having dinner here. Food was cooked to perfection.,4,TCDining,Chicago
"Food cooked to perfection, but don't forget to order dessert.   Highly recommending the lemon curd tart.",4,OpenTable Diner,Miami
Great Kobi steak and Scottish salmon. Wine list is superior.,5,Phil,Chicago
"Excellent food, service ambiance and drinks!  A very nice place!",4,OpenTable Diner,Cincinnati
"I dined inside at a window table. Beautiful view of the fountain and the lake. (Outside dining on a balcony/patio is also available). My server, Ann, was terrific. She made several suggestions and I was very pleased with both the entree and dessert she recommended. I highly recommend the S'More Creme Brulee for dessert!",5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"Our poor waitress was the only one working from the looks of it. Service was slow. Two of the breakfast dishes were cold and bland. My beet salad was a mushed up ball of greens with big chunks of beets. It tasted ok but was unappealing. Tables used to be linen covered, lending some elegance--- not on this Sunday. I selected this place for my birthday celebration and was embarrassed to have my out of town family be part of it. On the bright side--- the magical pop tart pastries were amazing.",2,SistasThree,Seattle
"Great venue and setting. Gracious dining without pretentiousness. Menu was varied...small plates, attractive appetizers and outstanding entrées. Deep fried calamari is outstanding blended with onion rings and diced potatoes is an appetizer is equal to an entre. My wife's filet was perfect. Upbeat but conversation friendly. Something for everybody. Beach town so service is relaxed and no need to dress up.  Can't find a thing wrong.",5,Barks1959,Chicago
Good value in St Joes. Food and service were good here. They have a nice spot overlooking the water and some outdoor dining as well. The value was very fair. The tomato soup was very good. Main dishes were nice. My wifes chicken was very good. The steak frites was fine. Would get the chicken over the steak. Coming from Chicago I sometimes forget meet not as good in other places. The Smores Crème Brulee was very good. Overall nice meal and no wait to get in.,4,Northshoredave,Chicago
"Cozy and romantic on inside, beautiful view of Lake Michigan and comfortable on terrace. $5 martini night with delicious cocktails, small menu but tasty varied choices. Young server with standard people skills, with less than expected check in on customers.  Would recommend for food, drinks and ambiance.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"The burgers and fries are delicious!!!!  The service was great, view from the patio was beautiful and our entire experience was a 10.  The botanical martini is amazing too, especially if Kayla makes it.",5,MrsMartini,Chicago
"Great meal, great view, great service!!",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
This was my first time at this restaurant the menu looked appetizing it was probably one of the worst meals I've had in my entire life overpriced and overrated,1,Boggygolfer,Chicago
"Food was very good and the waiter was super personable although sometimes scarce when we needed him.  We were a large group (10) so we were told we had to sit inside instead of outside on the patio as requested (it was a beautiful summer evening for a sunset dinner).  We were naturally disappointed; however, the interior of the restaurant was also very nice.  All things considered, we had a lovely evening.",4,OpenTable Diner,Denver
"Made reservations for 10 people at 10:00am through OpenTable, only to arrive and be told that they stop serving at 10:00am and don't even look at OpenTable reservations until 11:30am when they serve lunch.  What's the point of taking reservations through a service when you're not even serving food?  After showing our confirmation and the time, we were served the remains of their mediocre (at best) breakfast buffet for their hotel guests, but the attitude we were given was that they could have cared less about honoring our reservations.  They pretty much stated so.  The arrogance and obvious lack of  management, not to mention unimpressive food, will keep us and our future guests far away.  There are much better alternatives for brunch in the area (Plank's Tavern) that far exceed this tired and careless establishment.  The only thing they have going is the view from the bluff, and that's not enough to give them my business.",1,Robyn,Grand Rapids
The pork chop was excellent!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Fantastic food good service,5,OpenTable Diner,Nashville
Flight &amp; Nosh Pairing.   Enjoyed the food and the drink. Time it took to bring out the food after the flight was too long. Also recommend bringing the dessert drink and dessert out at the end together.  The drink was to warm and watered down from original.,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"3 of us had a very nice lunch to start the Independence Day holiday .. we were there July 3.   Slow start, we got there at 11:31 am opening and got two offers to get us a glass of wine, but they went off and never brought wine.  Finally an excellent server showed up and got our lunch party going.    BLT is great, burger was excellent, staff is friendly.  We sat on the outside balcony, it's on the second floor of this boutique-looking hotel, and it's very comfortable, sheltered from the elements, a nice overlook of Lake St. with a glimpse of Lake Michigan over the tree line.  The interior looks classy but dark lighting and colors, and not particularly interesting.  But, we'd definitely come back for an outdoor lunch again with the excellent food and friendly service.",4,IllinoisMike,Chicago
Great food. Sat outside on the deck. View is great.,5,AGKCO,Las Vegas
"The food was amazing, The view was incredible... The sun set over the lake during our dinner and it was fabulous. The service was the only thing that needs some help. Our server want that busy but kept disappearing for 15 minute periods. When I went to look for him to get a fork to eat my dinner, he was standing talking to the hostess at the host stand. 😒",4,KitchenofOz,Chicago
"Although the restaurant wasn't busy, we waited an hour to be served brunch which seems like an excessive amount of time.  We requested toast and  were charged $2 for ONE slice of toast -- a ridiculous charge which wasn't divulged at the time of ordering.  Seemed like a nice enough place, but will not return.",3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"We were staying at the Boulevard Inn which is attached to Bistro on the Boulevard. The hotel was wonderful, if you're wondering, but let's talk about the the restaurant. We were celebrating a special occasion and looking forward to a great meal. Our reservation was for 7pm. They were neither crowded, nor even close to full. When we changed our minds and decided to sit outside, it was a big deal. Many people had to be consulted and they seemed angry about it. Plenty of tables were open. What's the problem?? It was kind of hot out there. They have ceiling fans, but they weren't on. Our server was pleasant enough, but excruciatingly slow. Ordered roasted mushroom app and it was pretty flavorless. Burger was dry and flavorless. Steak ordered medium well came out medium rare. It was sent back and 20 minutes later another steak came out rare. Couldn't eat it. Steak was taken off the bill, but it seemed like they were doing us a favor by not charging us for food that was sent back...twice! Folks who were seated after us received their food way before we did. We couldn't figure out how that happened. Would have considered dessert, but it was already awkward with our server and the disappointing meal took 2 hours. We wanted to go. We probably won't eat here again. Bummer.",2,PersonWhoEatsFood,Chicago
"the food was good, pricey for the portion, but good. We love dining outside in the warm months.",4,Wanda,Chicago
The chicken liver pate was over the top. The main course special sable was delicious. The lemon tart desert was wonderful. It was great to see Verne Browne in the kitchen.,4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
It has become our new favorite restaurant. Will return soon. Everything was outstanding.,5,JoeL,Indiana
The Bistro has stepped up its game! The food is creative and fresh. The service has never been better. I would request Ruben for your server. He is always happy to serve and ready to accommodate any request.,5,SimplyGail4food,Pittsburgh
Lovely dining room with a lake bluff view.  Close to downtown.  Reasonably quiet.  We dined on a night that wasn't busy.  The service was exceptional.  The menu was creative and fun.  The food was excellent.  In the summer you can dine outside on a balcony.  This is just a great place to eat.,5,Edward3163,Grand Rapids
"This is the best (and only) restaurant in Harbor Country that features top quality food and an atmosphere where you can hear what is being said at the table.  There's plenty of room, and plenty of good food. They don't strike me as the kind of place that is going to decide to cater to loud drunks instead.  Go now. Go often.",4,HappyToBeSurprised,Chicago
What a great night. Everything was perfect. We absolutely loved the food. The dessert was too die for!!,5,OpenTable Diner,Indiana
"My first brunch experience at the Boulevard and I would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a good place for Sunday brunch. Quality service, great food and decently priced as well. I'll be back!",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"The quality of the food has been steadily improving, and the service is excellent as always.",5,Lulu1507,Grand Rapids
"Delightful! We shared several small plates before our main course. The beet salad was outstanding...as was the pasta dish. The wine pairings were perfect. All of the food was creative, surprising and delicious. The service was perfect...enthusiastic and professional. There was one thing that wasn't quite as good as the rest and the waiter noticed I hadn't eaten much of it. After dinner the manager came to the table to apologize for it. I told him it was good, just not as good as everything else. He adjusted our bill accordingly without our asking. They really care about the food being the best it can be. I highly recommend this place. It is definately fit for a foodie.  Oh.....and the chocolate dessert was unusual and wonderful! Try it.",5,Julesanna,Grand Rapids
"Its a bit overpriced. The food was good but some of it was just regular something with a  fancy name and a high price. Was a bit noisy and the people next to us REEKED of smoke the entire time, not the restaurants fault but you do sit close enough to people to notice this.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Reserve is a regular favorite.  Food preparation is imaginative and well constructed, with excellent product.  Waitstaff is knowledgeable and helpful -- sometimes a bit more than needed but it's nice to know they know what they are serving.    Excellent wine list and bar service.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
We dine at the Reserve several time a year.  The service is very good and the wine selection is outstanding.  The menu items offer a good variety whether you are hungry or just looking for a lite snack.  Nice variety and fun.  The outdoor deck is very nice when the weather is good.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Fantastic menu!  Great servers.  They are well versed in wine and cheese and the food overall.  If you like something a little unique, this is your place.",5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"We picked Reserve as we had tickets for a show next door and had never been there and we had the whole family. Kris our waiter was a superb server, I thought the atmosphere was a little cool for me. As I have a speech impediment I thought it was quite loud as it filled up. The food was great but you should have more than cheeseburgers for people that don't want to try new things. (my  grandson) Anyway it was nice but I do not believe we will be going there again.",4,Bob09,Grand Rapids
My duck was a little too rare.  There is a fine line between a perfectly cooked duck breast and a rare breast.   I also thought the drinks were too expensive.  The other mites were amazing and the service was great.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Food was great and service impeccable. A bit pricey, but worth it.",5,Lulu1507,Grand Rapids
"Good for appetizers with friends, not romantic or intimate occasions. Seating is cafe style, where you bump your neighbors' chairs every time you move... The food is tasty, however, choices for dinner are limited and somewhat odd. For example, fish is paired with beans, no choice to have rice or vegetables or potatoes. I would probably come here with girlfriends for some wine and cheeses, appetizers, and not for dinner.",3,Mystery,Grand Rapids
New Year’s Eve,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Great evening with several courses each extremely tasteful and we'll presented.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"We went there for our 10th wedding anniversary and had booked via Open Table. On arriving, we were initially seated at a table on the main dining area which seemed less than perfect for what was supposed to be a romantic special evening. However, the hostess arranged for their upper level to be opened up just for us. Now that’s called excellent service! From that point onwards, we knew we were in for a great time. Our server, Kris, brought us complimentary wine to celebrate the anniversary. His service was outstanding, at par with some of the best restaurants around the country. My wife is a vegetarian and Kris not only made suggestions to suit her dietary needs but got the kitchen to make substitutions that were in compliance with her vegetarianism. I would recommend Reserve to all for special occasions. They truly made our special day even more memorable!",5,Rajat,New York Area
Great food and great service!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"My go-to favorite place in downtown Grand Rapids; especially before and after Grand Rapids Symphony concerts at DeVos Concert Hall. It's not only the valet parking and location, however.  It's the food, the locally-sourced menu, the knowledgeable staff, the creative chef, and the plain, honest taste of each dish.  So much variety!",5,clarkvanhalsema,Grand Rapids
"The food, wine, service and GM were outstanding and exceptional!",5,OpenTable Diner,Northern MI
"Service was delayed and slow on a Wednesday evening. My friend and I both ordered the pork chop and were not impressed, especially for the price. The meat was tender but lacked flavor. The side of polenta and greens were whimpy with no texture. The sauce was unbalanced and quite sour- it tasted like straight vinegar. My husband was not impressed with his entree either. Our other friend ordered the burger and said it was okay. There are so many amazing restaurants in Grand Rapids; we see no reason to return to Reserve.",3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Wow!  The food and wine were so amazing. We dined before the Nutcracker and it was a memorable meal. Our server's suggestions were impeccable.  We cannot wait to return !,5,AmyA,Grand Rapids
It was awesome.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Perfect evening!,5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit

"Excellent Gin Cocktail with Rosemary and Pear!!   We took their suggestion and booked a table two hours b3efore Wicked and it was perfect timing as we were walking to the theatre next door shortly before 7pm (show was at 7:30), great service from our waiter and the hostesses were polite and friendly.  We enjoyed the brussel sprouts, frites, soup and entrees- thank you!",5,GRFoodie,Washington DC
"Date night before attending Wicked at Devos Performance Hall.  We started with some great cocktails and a charcuterie and cheese board.  It is what they are known for, and it was wonderful!  My wife had a pasta entree and I had duck. Both were exceptional.  Great decor and vibe.  We will make this a regular stop for sure.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Reservations were easy. Food was good. The staff was helpful dialing in choices that supported my vegan dietary needs.,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Very friendly staff.  Food portions are not overly large.  Charcuterie Board and choices are excellent.  Nice variety on the menu.  Wine prices are a little on the high side.,5,Jerry,Columbus
Brussel sprouts were amazing. Our server was great. And an excellent dirty martini!,5,foodsnob,Detroit
"Went there for a business lunch and was surprised by the limited lunch menu. Not that it was bad, just that it wasn't very diverse.  Basically a few sandwiches and salads.  Clearly the feature is the wine, which wasn't an option at lunch.  Will definitely go back to sample the wine.",4,Sensational,New York Area
"Really enjoyed dinner at Reserve. Have a great time every time I go. Our waiter picked up on our vibes and had fun with us. Very knowledgeable about the wine and the food. Would definitely go back.   Can get a little pricey, so more of a special occasion place for me. However, can certainly be less pricey depending on how you order.",5,Shopgrl4330,Grand Rapids
Superb dining in the heart of the city.  Convenient to DeVos Centre and the Amway Grand.  Upscale yet comfortable.  Cruvinet bar with a wine selection second to none.  Friendly atmosphere and outstanding service.  Valet parking available.,5,Rick,Grand Rapids
"A downtown Grand Rapids restaurant with an excellent and fully deserved reputation. Reserve has an inviting dining area decorated with interesting art, including the 2009 ArtPrize winning painting; an attentive and knowledgeable staff; a noteworthy wine and beverage list; and a menu full of surprises and pleasures. We were a party of four, one of whom had mobility issues, that needed to be done at a certain time so we could go to the opera, and they accommodated us well. Highly recommend",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Cold soup, undercooked risotto.  Very small portions",3,Foodie,Detroit
"My friend and I had a great time at Reserve.  The service was perfect, the wine amazing and the food delicious.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend to all.",5,OpenTable Diner,Los Angeles
Awesome service on a secluded covered upper level patio. Fantastic wine list and delicious small plates.,5,Nice,Grand Rapids
"Great food and service.  Highly recommend the cheese plate.  Portions are not big and wine pours are light, especially the flights.  A little pricey, but if they were a little more generous on the pours  I would give a higher rating in value.",3,Tish,San Francisco
"Girls night with my daughter started out a little slow on the service,  but ended with fabulous food and extra special attention from the manager and our server! We will return!",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Always a great place for wine, food and great service!  Perfect before a show.",4,Winter,Grand Rapids
"Enjoyed the meal again.  I was unhappy about being the first person in the door, having reservations and then being seated at a small table by the door in the first room.  Fortunately when I requested to be moved to the second room which is quieter and warmer, the staff complied.  The rest of the experience was great.  Good food, good service, good location.",4,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Excellent!!,5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"It was one of our favorite neighborhood options, but with a lot of turnover, Osteria Rossa has lost a step or two since it opened a few years ago.  Server pushed hard for the swordfish special but it was surprisingly flavorless.  Another diner in our group thought her spaghetti was overcooked and didn't eat much of it.",3,Bruce10,Grand Rapids
Never disappointed! Great food and awesome service.,5,OpenTable Diner,Toronto
"Food was excellent, service was great, and overall experience was very nice!",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids

"The octopus app and linguine was fantastic!  It’s always a favorite. The cocktail before was meh and we kept getting  a blasts of cold air when the door opened, but overall it was lovely as always.",4,OpenTable Diner,Las Vegas
"This was my second time at Osteria Rossa, both times I have had a reservation. Both times I have waited over 20 minutes past my reservation time for a table.",2,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"My wife and I had never dined here before, but had seen many good reviews.  I had the lamb shank and my wife had the roast duck.  Both were excellent.  The restaurant was busy for a weekday, but our server was very attentive and managed to keep up with little waiting.  We definitely will return.",4,GrandvilleMB,Grand Rapids
"'Thoroughly enjoyed the lamb dish!  Our server, Dakota, was so polite and courteous - even in the midst of a full-house rush.   A truly enjoyable dinner.",5,Siglo,Chicago

"Food was inconsistent. Apple dessert was cold, and was supposed to be warm.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
I love the atmosphere! The TVs at the bar are perfect if you want to watch while you have a drink and share a pizza. The tables are great if you want an intimate dinner for two or a lovely meal for more! Food is to die for.,5,OpenTable Diner,Kansas City
"We loved our NYE date at Osteria Rossa, a great wine list, quality food, and attentive service. Our only complaint is that the portions are pretty small, so if you are looking for a big meal, you might be disappointed or go for the big pasta!!",4,KAS1,Grand Rapids
"Had a wonderful dinner! Food was authentic, with house made sauces on the pasta, the spinach salad was a well composed dish. If you sit at the bar you can see the culinary staff hard at work preparing food and working the wood burning pizza oven. Our bar tender was kind and attentive. When we visit Grand Rapids again we will be back!",5,MissJMW,Cleveland
"the service and food were amazing.  We were seated in an area with a large and boisterous group, which made it a little difficult to talk at times. other than that it was an excellent experience.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids

"Great family holiday meal!  Excellent food and prompt, courteous service.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
The food was superb! Make sure to do a reservation as the wait can be a little long. The antipasti was outstanding as all the cheeses were high-quality,5,Anthonyr,Grand Rapids
"I went on a date with my boyfriend and landed a reservation here. We had mussels as an app and absolutely loved them! I'm gluten free and they had many delicious options. I ended up getting one of their pastas and it was delicious. My boyfriend wasn't a huge fan of his meal but was still pleased. We had a great night here. I would recommend it, especially for gluten free people.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"The amount of food we got for the price was great! Food was delicious, however the desert was like a hard rock (only complaint). I have ate at Osteria before and liked the environment and food. The pasta and steak there is amazing!  Definitely recommend",4,Jonn,Grand Rapids
We went downtown for a last minute get together with friends and had a wonderful time. I would highly recommend Osteria Rossa . :),5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"We've been to Osteria Rossa several times since it opened, and this latest visit did not disappoint. Great food, interesting and varied wine list, lovely view of Monument Square and UICA, attentive and well informed staff. This time the group included my wife and stepson, and there were good choices on the meu for everyone. The desserts are worth saving room for.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Delicious food, wine, and excellent service!!! We loved it!",5,Bravo,New York Area
Perfect Pasta Night!!  Best way to spend a Wednesday night in Holland.,5,Jans,Grand Rapids
Delicious!  Small menu but had a little of everything. Had a quaint table for two. Relaxed dining experience.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"I took my girlfriend there for her birthday and it was a good experience overall. Despite having a couple of my friends not recommend it due to some personal and professional differences, it was a very good date night. I made a reservation and got a good table and they even wrote Happy Birthday on the paper on top of the table cloth. Desert was also on the house for her, which was certainly an added bonus and it was a treat. I ate the house burger on a pretzel bun which was fantastic. It was juicy and succulent, and it had just a pinch of salt on the bun underneath that really enhanced the flavor. My girlfriend ordered the short rib, which while pricey, was delicious.  All and all, without paying for desert, or alcohol, I paid about 50$ for a great dining experience. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good time in a fancy place,  however it's not very kid friendly just because of how upscale it is.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"If looking for a more romantic setting, ask for seating  on the 8th street side of the restaurant.",4,OpenTable Diner,Cincinnati
"The mussels and the duck confit were delicious and I would have given it a 5 star on food, however the dessert...Black Forest cake was dire, the worst I have ever been served.   The cake was dried out, and the icing was awful...perhaps too much time in a freezer?  Too bad because it is the ending your remember best.",4,RaeL,Chicago
Special Holiday Dinner,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Undercooked steak.  A burger with missing items. Mediocre dessert.  Average service.  I wouldn't expect much more from any Holland, MI, restaurant.",3,Elle,Chicago
"Butch’s is always wonderful.  We can always count on good food, great service and ambiance.  They have a great wine selection and the bartender knows how to make great cocktails.  This is our favorite restaurant in the Holland area.",5,KathyP,New York Area
I was disappointed in the option of vegetarian dishes.  Literally my only option was soup and a salad. Which were both amazing but it would have been nice to have at least two vegetarian entrees on the dinner menu.  Our waitress was VERY attentive without being overbearing. I was thankful that they took reservations on the weekend.   Our server indicated there was a problem in the kitchen delaying our food and brought us complimentary soup while we waited. My leftover were thrown out by mistake and the waitress had a brand new salad boxes for me to go. Which I would have never in a million years expected.  While window seating provided a bit more distance from the other tables - it was chilly- but still great ambiance and motion to the environment without it. Ring overbearing.  The food was beautifully presented and I appreciated knowing the vegetables were grown locally.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Great food. Great place.,5,ab112263,Grand Rapids
We had the short ribs and the trout.  They both were excellent.,5,Barb,Chicago
"First (and will not be last!) time at this delightful restaurant.  Staff was very friendly, from the hostesses to our waiter (sorry, I do not remember names).  Answered our various questions about the menu - we had the two soups, burger, and a delicious salad with apples.  We were celebrating my Mother's Birthday and such a treat when our waiter offered her a dessert - she had the madelines, which were baked and presented warm - absolutely fantastic!! Thank you for the wonderful evening dining experience!!",5,GRFoodie,Washington DC
"We always enjoy our meals at Butch's. Very creative menu items, great wine list and very good service.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Butch's is our go to spot every time we're in Holland. There are always interesting things on the menu and the wide ranging wine selections are reasonably priced.  We find the service to consistently be knowledgeable and professional. It's a great place to celebrate or just enjoy one another's company!,5,Excellent,Chicago
"Great value, good food.  Would definitely come back!",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Very popular with large groups which makes it a bit chaotic for dinner for two.  Service was unexpectedly good for such a crowd, however, and food was right down the middle.",3,RobertK,Indiana
"Service was very slow. Food was good, just took way too long for dinner",3,Dave,Detroit
"A favorite of ours in Holland.  Excellent creative menu, elegant but easy-going atmosphere. More formal seating in front; casual ""pub""-like seating and outdoor area in back. Never disappoints.",5,Roy1,Grand Rapids
Dustin was our waiter. He was vantastic! He made our anniversary dinner memorable!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Butch's is our favorite stop when in the Holland area.  Food, service and especially the wine selection from Italy, Spain etc. are amazing!!",5,MarcB,Detroit
Always a great experience- the food and personal service create a wonderful experience. The owner leads by example for sure .,5,charlie,St. Louis
"Our special occasion was my parent's anniversary. We had an energetic waiter that was attentive, but had little knowledge of the wine's served from their wine list. Food was well prepared and dinners were accompanied by a house salad. The ambiance of Butch's Dry Dock was quiet and comfortable. We would consider Butch's again when dining in Holland Michigan.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids

Wonderful food at a reasonable price. Atmosphere was pleasant and the service was great! Will definitely return.,5,OpenTable Diner,Washington DC

One of our favorites!  Always delicious &amp; cozy.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Food is great, full of flavor, waiter was knowledgeable and friendly, fun wine list",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
I have been her a couple times before and absolutely loved it.  That being said I was a little disappointed in the menu changes.  My favorite salad was no longer available and the new ones were a little out there for my tastes.  I usually order the Rigatoni which is delicious but decided to try some thing new.  I ordered the Polo Cacciatori which would have been a satisfying meal except that I had to have it returned to the grill as the on bone chicken was not cooked through.  Everyone else in my party was very pleased with their meals.  One person ordered a pizza that looked to die for and a whole stuffed fish was also delicious looking.,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"I was disappointed upon arrival that “open table overbooked the restaurant” and that we would need to wait 20-30 minutes for a table. Thankfully two spots at the bar were open that we could eat at or we would been in jeopardy of missing our show or not having time to eat.   Beyond that, everything was fantastic. The bartender was swamped but still provided good service. The food is amazing.",4,GRcj,Grand Rapids
Great fun to watch the cooks work while sitting at the bar.,5,Chayzoo,Grand Rapids
"It was ok at best. The chicken dish I ordered was bland. My wife's pasta dish was better, until we tried cold pieces of pasta. It took about 8 minutes to get greeted. It took another 15 mins to get the beer I ordered. I don't even know how long it took to get my second and last beer. The oil and bread, which is not complementary, was hard. I was not pleased with my visit, as I was expecting more out of this place. Would love to give this place a second chance if offered some sort of gift card.",2,Boulevard13,Grand Rapids
"I brought my adult daughter for a pre ""Wicked"" meal and drink. This is the third time I've been to the restaurant and this time the service and food was average.  Unfortunately, the waitress was very busy as well as training another and didn't give us much service. Food servers literally dumped our orders down on the table without a smile and not an ounce of engagement.  The other two times I've found the service, atmosphere and the food very good and the wait staff friendly and helpful.  I hope this was an oddity rather than a trend because the restaurant could be a cozy, fun friendly, great place to gather.",3,Kristine,Grand Rapids
"Although the food is excellent, the noise level makes it very difficult to carryon any type of conversation.",3,OsteriaRossa,Grand Rapids
Went there for my Anniversary and it was great. We had the scallops and filet and both were cooked perfectly. The walk up coolers with beer and wine to select from and take to your table was an unexpected surprise and added to the already great experience.,5,Mark,Detroit
This was our first visit to Holland. We were totally impressed with this restaurant from the pacing of the meal to the amazing food and waitstaff.  Highly recommend!!,5,lovetotravel,Chicago

"My friends &amp; I went to Holland for a day trip from Chicago. The outside patio, where we were seated, is very cute. There were not many guests but service was still quite slow. The food was good but nothing spectacular.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"We had great food but, our waitress seemed overwhelmed and didn't have the manners we expected from Butch's.  I will return at lunch because I enjoy their lunch menu more than evening dining.",3,Sava12,San Francisco
"Great evening out.  Nice drinks, food and server but food was very slow out of the kitchen. This was our second visit. Slowness was probably just an anomaly. Will give it another go, for sure.",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
My husband and I split the scallops w/bacon and the pork tenderloin. Both were excellent!!! It was nice outside so we opted for deck dining which had nice music playing. It was nice they allowed us to upgrade to any salad they offered. We would highly recommend the food here and the restaurant.,5,SharonR,Detroit
Food was good but portion was small for price. Waiter was phenomenal. I would go again.,4,beauford18,Chicago
Truffles were in season and being offered in the daily specials. We tried the shareable noodles with truffles and it did not disappoint. Great flavor. The spring vegetable soup and fish tacos were also delicious.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Good meal but fish tacos were over cooked,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"I've been to Bistro Bella Vita so many times because it is always a great choice. My first choice to entertain out-of-town clients, meet friends for drinks and/or dinner, enjoy a martini on the patio, or celebrate a special occasion. I am always happy with the food, the service and the atmosphere. I recommend it!",5,Ruby,Grand Rapids
"I have enjoyed dining at Bistro for many years and almost always have a great experience, which is why my expectations are so high. I have to say, this time, all of the dishes we ordered could have been improved. We started with the wild mushroom polenta, which lacked any contrasting texture, and ""wild mushroom"" gave the impression there would be something exotic about the mushrooms but they were just baby bellas. Our entrees, Ricotta Gnudi and the Salmon were good, but the amount of truffle oil in the Gnudi was imperceptible and the dish was under seasoned. Although the salmon needed a starch component to the dish, the lobster broth was very good. These comments aside, my salmon was prepared perfectly and the gnudi itself is always spot on. I love the atmosphere here and the service is always dependable. Maybe it was just an off night for the kitchen.",3,Stellabee,Grand Rapids
Was Amazing! Can't wait to go back!,5,Bani,Grand Rapids
I've been here multiple times and will continue doing so. Definitely a go-to.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
I was taking my partner out for a late valentines celebration. When our fantastic server greater us we told him what special night  we had planned. He had helped us create an intimate dining experience that we both enjoyed. He gave us great recommendations   and was satisfied with the option we chose for our meals. I suggest if you are a chocolate lover to get the flour less chocolate cake when you are there! It melts in your mouth! I also loved the fresh made pasta! Certainly something for everyone here!,4,AlexV,Grand Rapids
Great martinis!,4,BPS22,San Francisco
"I had lived in Grand Rapids and worked right next to Bistro for quite a long time without having gone there, thinking of it as a special occasion restaurant.  Turns out that although Bistro has some of the trappings of a higher-end restaurant, they biffed it on a couple of the fundamentals.  They have appealing offerings on all sections of the menu with some uncommon-enough-to-be-special ingredients, and knowledgeable and attentive wait staff.  BUT the beans in my cassoulet were very dry, and the pasta in my wife's dish was undercooked (no, I'm not confusing with al dente).  You have to stick the landing, guys!  The meats and sauces were well done but hard to enjoy with half of each bite being a prominent ingredient that was poorly executed.  The hardest part of this review is ""would you recommend to a friend?""  Short answer yes with an if, long answer no with a but.  Yes if you've already tried other GR restaurants in this price bracket and want something new.  For others, no, but I really want them to fix that last little step so I can come back.  When one ingredient isn't lagging behind the others, the price will be justified.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Reservations were easy to make ahead of a hockey game with Out of town guests. Service was prompt; drinks and dinner were good. Guests enjoyed the night.,4,Brew,Detroit
Fabulous as always!!  The calamari was perfect. The moscato was cold and our server Dennis made sure our glasses were always full. Loved the entree specials. The cheesecake was the best Ive ever tasted!! Everything was perfect for our birthday celebration.,5,MGee,Chicago

"Had a great Valentines Day meal. This was my first time at Bistro Bella Vita, and I'll definitely go back. Emily was our server and she was so sweet. Paella was excellent.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
My filet was a little rare for medium well.,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"We had a wonderful Valentines Day dinner.  On a cold night, valet service was important and prompt.  The menu is priced reasonable with entrees priced from about $18-38, with lots available in the low $20 range.  The meal only took a few minutes from order to table so I would suggest waiting a while to order if you want a little more leisure.  Service was great and the 3 for $16 dessert option is a deal.",5,Mark,Grand Rapids
"If you were to put a plate of the rotisserie chicken on my head, I'd be liable to beat my brains out with my tongue.  If you're reading this on a phone downtown, put it away, turn sharply toward the direction of Bella Vita, and run as fast as you legs can carry you.  It's pretty good and I like it a lot.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"We had a bad table placement near the entrance/front door.  Food was very good, nice menu choices.  Drink menu/bar was very good as well.  We had a prompt and friendly waiter.  Besides the bad table,  the place was very loud and wouldnt recommend it for a nice quiet dinner.",5,MikeZ,Detroit
"We went for our anniversary; the food was good, service very good. Food came out quickly, and since we didn't order dessert, we were in and out in under an hour.  Although our wait staff didn't rush us on decisions, it still seemed like it was fast.",4,ReisterMeister1,Grand Rapids
The service is excellent and the food is great. Our group had an amazing time and everyone enjoyed their food.,5,PattiS,Grand Rapids
It was our first time dining at Bistro and it was absolutely wonderful! So excited to try the food again soon :),5,Great4dates,Grand Rapids
"Always a good experience. While Bistro Bella Vita's entrees are a little on the pricier side of my typical restaurant experience, it's worth it. Many times while considering a cool new place to eat for a special occasion, I come back to Bistro. It has enough of an upscale feel, but it's comfortable and relaxed. No adjustment period, even after being away for a long time. Friendly staff too. Our waiter took time to make conversation and discuss favorite foods and drinks (even brought a whisky sample), but wasn't ""too present.""",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids

I had lunch with business associates this week.  The service was great.  I was quite enough to transact business.  The food was very good and was served in a timely fashion.    The only problem was the parking is a bit challenging.,5,Mick,Grand Rapids

Loved everything about this restaurant.,5,finediner,Detroit
"As always, the food and service was great.  Atmosphere is great, even with a crowd it is still easy to hear and have a conversation.  Took some friends for their first trip to the restaurant and both really enjoyed.  Will be back!",4,tzap,Grand Rapids
"Bistro Bella Vita was a perfect choice for a late night dinner. Between the timely service and spot on dishes it was hard to decide what our favorite part was. To anyone who likes deserts, I would recommend the cinnamon roll time and time again. It was warm and fluffy without having an over powering glaze and perfectly complimented with vanilla pecan ice cream. Couldn't have asked for a more pleasant meal",5,Hobbit4life,Grand Rapids
"You would think because I had made an Open Table reservation that Bisto would assume I'd write a review, but I guess they don't care.  Overall, I felt that the food was good, however over priced.  We were seated directly next to the kitchen and I guess this made our server think that we needed to be spoken to each time she passed.  Our party of 3 had the distinct feeling we were being pushed through as fast as possible.  Our appetizer arrived in less than one minute!  You have to pay for bread!  $1.50 a person (and it's not that great or plentiful).  Servings not as large as you would think for the price.  Our meal can in probably ten minutes.  We were in and out in less than an hour!  Not much of a dining experience.  There are many great restaurants in downtown Grand Rapids  - don't waste your time on this one.",3,kaye,Grand Rapids
"It's difficult to decide what to order but butternut squash ravioli is my new favorite meal choice at the Bistro.   The bread they serve by local artisan baker Field and Fire is also delish.   Many choices of martinis also makes choosing difficult but fun.  The location is  convenient to the arena or local events within walking distance.  Our server was attentive, kept the drinks flowing and kept things moving so we didn't miss our show.  The place got crowded and looked to be fully booked the Saturday evening we were there.",4,Chiara,Grand Rapids
We had a wonderful experience celebrating our anniversary. The food was amazing the server knowledgeable and very friendly,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"We dined on a snowy Tuesday night, so the restaurant was not crowded. The food was good. My spouse had the cassoulet and I had a seasonal gnocchi and sausage dish. Our meals came very quickly, shortly after the appetizer arrived, so dinner did not feel leisurely. The portions were adequate, however I thought the dinners and desserts were overpriced.",3,Dianne,Grand Rapids
Overall we had a great experience here. My girlfriend loved the green pasta and I loved the pizza as well. Good atmosphere and overall satisfaction.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"At this price, this is a special-occasions-only restaurant.",2,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids

"Bistro Bella Vita is consistently a great place for dinner.  Most recently, my husband and parents had dinner here, on New Year's Eve.  Our table was ready, even though we were a few minutes early for the reservation time.  The service was great, as always.  The food was wonderful, made with high quality ingredients.  There hasn't been a dish yet, that didn't meet our expectations.",5,BirthdayGirl,Grand Rapids
"Delicious food, superb wine selection and very knowledgeable staff. Love to sit in the lounge and hear great live music.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Great place to have delicious food - most recommended beef wellington, and superb desserts.  Extensive wine list and great service.  True tastes of Italy, great for romantic birthdays and special occasions.  It is very nice when the owners take their time to visit with each table, chat with their costumers, and oversee the operations closely.",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
The meal was spectacular.  This was lovely Italian in every regard.  The sommelier was slow to our table but recovered with a good recommendation.  Noto's has shown a new page.  We were very pleased.,5,milan73mgb,Grand Rapids

"Never have had a bad meal ,never had a bad experience at Noto’s .  Always great service great food and a great family.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Food was atrocious to say the least. Anitpasti board was average at best &amp; risotto was literally soup. Completely unacceptable. Wine is the only redeeming quality of this restaurant.,2,Anonymous1,Detroit
Great service and atmosphere.  Our waitress was very personable and was very attentive,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"This was an after Christmas family dinner.  Overall our experience was good.  There were very few people in the restaurant when we dined and we found the temperature in the building to be cold.  Because of the limited number of people, the music coming from the bar was loud and we were not able to enjoy conversation at a normal voice level.  We would not recommend Noto's for a family dinner again especially with teen age children----the menu was not especially pleasing to them.",3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"An exceptional dining experience: attentive, friendly service; excellent food, wonderful ambiance, all perfectly accompanied by live jazz.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Great ambiance. They also have a very neat area for group meetings/dinners.,5,JayS,New York Area
As always fantastic!!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Outstanding food and wine delivered with warmth and professional service.,5,Bruce,Grand Rapids
"Was served meatball with cold, raw meat in the center.  Wine did not arrive until mid-meal because nobody had key to wine cellar.",3,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
I was not allowed to eat because I was wearing a hat.,1,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"The food was only ok, certainly not what I would expect for the price. Also, in my reservation I stated that this was for my mom's birthday. No mention was made. No happy birthday. Nothing.  This is not acceptable.",3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Service was good, but food was not all that good. Not too favorable, bland, did not feel fresh. Was not what I expected. Service was good. At least",3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Great food, service and ambiance!",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
First time eating at Noto's and the food and service were excellent.  I highly recommend Noto's.,5,JimandAmy,Grand Rapids
"The service was great but the food was the star of the night. Amazing!! Very friendly staff, that gave us a tour of the wine cellar and entire restaurant.",5,OpenTable Diner,Orlando
"Great food, good service,  $$$. Plenty of seating. Good for casual or more formal dining.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Noto's is a little out of the way for the general Grand Rapids market but it is an easy drive by using I-96 and 28th Street. The wine list is incredible (regularly recognized by WineSpectator) and there is knowledgeable and friendly assistance for those less familiar with the extensive list of vintages. We tried specials on the menu - both were flavorful and delivered on the promise of their description. However, the standard dishes are of great quality and the selection would satisfy a wide variety of palates. My experience has shown predictably high quality service - friendly, helpful and patient. This is a great room for conversation since the tables are well spaced and the room quiet. I highly recommend Noto's - not the lowest cost but a great value for a great meal. Oh, and save room for desert.",5,BobH,Grand Rapids
I enjoyed Noto's new menu.  I had the pumpkin ravioli.  The new chef came out to talk and that was a lot of fun listening to him.  I wish the decor was a little more modern but I can't eat the decor so I guess it doesn't matter.,5,power2b,Grand Rapids
Pretty expensive for the quality and quantity of food and drink. Not very satisfying overall.,3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Service and food were awesome.  We enjoyed a birthday dinner for one of our guests.  Our server overheard us toast Happy Birthday to one of our guests and after dinner before we ordered dessert, our server comes out with this beautiful dessert with a lit candle  with the words Happy Birthday written in chocolate on the plate.  Our guest was delighted and it was a total surprise to all of us.  Noto's made her celebration very special and memorable.  Thank you to our server and the chef and to the Noto Family for their incredible hospitality.",5,MikeA,Grand Rapids
"Great Food! Our waiter was a bit slow, taking him 20 min to get to our table and another 10-15 to bring our drinks.  However, the bar manager Chad who is extremely knowledgeable, came to our table and helped make our experience fantastic! Definitely recommend this restaurant!",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
We celebrated four September birthdays. Our server was great and she complimented our group. Food was exemplary and the drinks prepared perfectly. The salmon special was voted as the best dish of our group of six. Tony spoke with us and he introduced us to the Hell's Kitchen chef.  A lovely time was had by all.,5,Di9Sig,Detroit
The food was cold and the chicken was not cooked.  sorry this was a disappointment for my wife on her names day,3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
We had a wonderful Birthday &amp; Anniversary dinner. The food was excellent. The owner and the Exuctive Chef took the time to stop by our table to ensure everything was great.,5,Rosevelt,Indiana
"I  dine at Noto's about once a year, and this year took my daughter in for her 50th birthday.  There were 5 of us in our party and we all ordered something different, so that we could sample different plates.  Everything was absolutely fantastic.  Service was excellent.  I did have to order my iced tea twice before I finally got it, but they didn't end up charging me for it.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants a fantastic luxury dinner out with family and friends without having to spend their entire paycheck on the meal.",5,Kashmere,Grand Rapids
"Noto's is such a gem of a place - fantastic food, family owned, and an elegant atmosphere. We are delighted every time!",5,Sarah,Grand Rapids
"Excellent food, excellent service. Cant go wrong here, and the wine list is 42 pages long... you will find something you like here.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
This family owned and operated establishment is truly a gem and Italian foodie nirvana. The meatball was succulent and moist without being overly spiced. We'll worth it as an appetizer and large enough to share for two.  My salad was well seasoned as was my wifes.  The entrees were heavenly my steak was cooked to the perfect temperature and my wife's ravioli was light and the sauce was rich and creamy without being overwhelming. Our desert was over the top wonderful. The tiramisu was one of the best I've ever had.  The wait staff was friendly and familiar with the menu so as to have been able to answer any questions we had. The wine list may seem overwhelming but the Somalia was informative friendly. My family heritage is  Italian so it is difficult for me to find Italian food that I can be satisfied with. This is one of best Italian  restaurants I've eaten at and I would be proud to recommend Noto's to anyone that loves great Italian  food.,5,OpenTable Diner,Seattle
Amazing!!!! Set  the bar for customer service.,5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Great Entre. Small appetizers. Very elegant place. Which they should tell you that. From out of town and felt very underdressed. Everything ala carte. Kinda pricey.,4,OpenTable Diner,Las Vegas
"Our reservation was at 9:15 and the restaurant was almost empty.  The wine we chose from the wine list wasn't available so the waiter gave us something that was supposed to be comparable to our original pick of a $50 bottle of Chianti.  This bottle was not good, the wine was not anything special - it was just below average.  We felt bad to ask for the wine list to choose another bottle on our own since they just brought us a random bottle and said that the owner recommended it.  The food is over-spiced, possibly pre-cooked and just not really that fresh or good.  The decor is stuck in the 80s and there were some flies buzzing around us all night. To add the cherry on top, none of our credit cards were accepted and we were forced to pay in cash due to issues with their card machine.",1,OpenTable Diner,Miami
"Amazing food, amazing service and best wine list I have ever experienced!",5,DLMIII,Grand Rapids
"My wife and I visited Noto's for the first time this past weekend to celebrate our 34th wedding anniversary. We had been in Italy for our 33rd and wanted to recreate some of the culinary memories. Aaron, our server, and Chad, the sommelier, helped us design a 5 course meal that was wonderful. They were helpful and attentive without being overbearing. The food was excellent. The wine parings were spot on. And the pacing was relaxed yet efficient. Highly recommend.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Notos is an amazing dining experience in every way.  From the  extraordinary wine selection, to The beautifully prepared amazingly creative food to the knowledgeable and attentive waitstaff this is the place to be . If you choose to go ,plan on taking some time ,plan on enjoying the meal and eating in course.   Chad the sommelier will help you select and educate you about  a wine perfect for your meal. Whether it's a casual evening out or an evening with that  someone special .  Noto's is it!  Our  thanks to the Noto family for always making our dining there a wonderful experience.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
We have joyed wonderful meals of celebration at Noto's over the years. The most recent visit was with my grandson after his high school graduation. Just the two of us. We could really  talk and enjoy one another's company.,5,Susy,Grand Rapids
"as always, the food was really good. one of the better food experiences in our area, unfortunately the service was less than sub-par. won't stop me from going again but it will lessen the frequency.",3,OpenTable Diner,Miami
We have not visited for a while and I was a bit disappointed. Service was good. Appetizers we're very good and dessert was excellent!  But the entray was an expensive disappointment!  The fish was overcooked and tasted old.,3,Docc,Chicago
"We are here, a party of four on New Year's Eve.  We were disappointed with the fixed menu options. Our food came out cold and the sweet potatoes were also undercooked. Our server did the best she could and was very sweet. We had an early seating and perhaps they were not quite ready. We have eaten here before and had much better results so we would give it another try.",3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
We love going to see Santa at Sunday brunch. However this year the brunch was not up to the Bistro's normally high standard,5,Chief,Grand Rapids
"They did not have our reservation from Open Table, I however had my confirmation.  I did call to confirm also because of our large party.  They set us in the bar with tables pushed together, we had three children under two .  Food bland and generally un appealing, not much of a brunch.   SANTA. outstanding.  He was highlight of our visit.  He was a great santa visit.  Beautiful setting over looking the lake.  I would NOT recommend the Bistro as a place to dine.",3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"If you want fine dining in a room where you can hear what is being said, look no further. This is the best dining restaurant in Harbor Country. Don't let the Lawrence Welk - style decor fool you. The food is creative, carefully prepared and delicious. We sampled all the appetizers -- not a bad one in the lot. The main dishes seemed pedestrian, ""careful"" choices (chicken, fish, etc.)  But the attention to detail and thoughtful presentation make this a go-to destination. There is a bounteous selection of craft beers. Tabor Hill is on the wine list -- which normally means leave this restaurant at once. But thankfully there are also drinkable wines available -- we had an excellent unoaked Chardonnay.  With the redesign of the Terrace Room to become a shouting frat bar, Bistro on the Boulevard is now the place to go for a quality, enjoyable meal.  It's worth the drive.",4,HappyToBeSurprised,Chicago
"We hadn't been there in about a year. While we always liked it, this time was a real treat. My husband raved over the cassoulet and my steak au poivre was just perfect. The pumpkin cheesecake dessert was a work of art. We won't wait so long to go back. The chef is making a difference!",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Food was good but not great - service however was wonderful. Our server ""got"" the fact we were two old friends who hadn't seen each other in a while so was  good about letting us talk while also gentlying reminding us on the closing hours for their Sunday Brunch service.",4,KPMI,Chicago
"We stopped by Bistro on the Blvd on a Friday night, late (9:15 pm).  We had not been there in years, but were in town for the weekend and thought we'd give it a try again.  Although the menu was not extensive, all of the food was very, very good.  The locally grown, sautéed mushrooms were exquisite.  The wine list had an ample selection of quality wines from a variety of wine regions (including some from local Michigan producers).  The service was attentive and friendly, without being intrusive.  We'd definitely go back the next time we are in town.",4,NDOpus,Los Angeles
"Atmosphere not as good/vibrant as expected for a Thursday night. Upstairs seating is the pits, no atmosphere at all, probably best seating option, though, with a group. Be prepared to spend alot of money in a about an hour's worth of time, upwards of $70 for two people for minimal drinks and food, and then be prepared to spend more money elsewhere in order to feel full and like you've had a drink. Place best if you only have a short time and want a quick and nice glass of wine. Not a place to hang out.",2,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"Best food, wine, atmosphere that I have experienced in Grand Rapids.",5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
The entrees were good but a little overpriced for what you get. Small plates were reasonable and decent portions. Wine list was extensive . I would recommend to go for a glass of wine and cheese plate. The only really con is the waitress was more interested in turning the table then service.,3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Reserve mixes high class and high touch service with outstanding food and wine while creating a relaxing atmosphere that allows lingering over a glass of wine and having a great conversation. Servers are knowledgeable, attentive, welcoming and adept at guiding choices from the menu and the wine list. The flights are a great idea to encourage sampling and learning about wine. I also discovered a new wine fave: Tir Na Nog, which I have seen nowhere else. This is my new downtown ""go to"" place for festive occasions.",5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
The Reserve is a perfect location to relax in a posh setting while enjoying fabulous wine. Their wine flights are delightful and their desserts are superb. You won't find another place like it in Grand Rapids. It's a must visit.,5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
food was fantastic. service was a little slow.,4,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"We attended the Wine vs. Beer event. It was a great way for a first visit to experience a little of everything, and there was plenty of food. We were all full at the end, and it was fun to discuss the different dishes.",3,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"The wine list is spectacular and the food was phenomenal, without being too expensive. However, be careful about reservations here and be sure you don't let them stick you in the middle of the hallway upstairs. It's crowded and I had to keep moving to avoid being in the way of waitstaff and other patrons. It was pretty bad for an establishment like this. However, the at table service was good, so it wasn't a complete disaster.",2,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
They were out of one of the wines we wanted and out of thebsmoked whitefish on the smoked fish platter which was disappointing. Loud and service slow.,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Reserve is a great place to entertain out of town clients or friends. it has a New York feel to it. the food changes on a regular basis and is always very good! the staff really like k being there and do a great job. the wine list can meet any price range you may want to be in. Overall i highly reccomend Reserve. Mark and Lisa, Grand Rapids MI",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Made reservations for a table for 10, 2 days in advance - requested upstairs seating. Arrived on time &amp; were told ""some other"" groups wanted to be upstairs as well. Our party of 10 was seated at a table for 8 until a nearby table of 2 had finished. We sat directly next to the door – it was loud and drafty. Our dissatisfaction wasn’t even met with eye contact, let alone a sincere apology from the hostess. Reserve was also “out” of one of the main dishes early on a Friday night. Awkward waiter. This is my 2nd negative experience at Reserve. I want Reserve to do well – it’s beautifully decorated, has an extensive wine list and boasts a prime downtown location. They need to re-train the service, and hone in on the clientele they want to keep.",2,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"It's a treat to go to a restaurant that takes care with details -- the food is carefully thought out and tasty, the wine list is comprehensive, the decor is interesting, and best of all, the servers are able to articulate the thought behind all of those, giving great guidance on beverage choice, menu choices, and the daily specials. Each time we've gone, we've discovered a new gem.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Reserve is a fantastic wine bar. The selection of wine by the glass is unmatched. As a wonderful bonus, the food is outstanding. The small plates selection is unique and delicious.",5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Hip and fun...worth going just for the wine list!,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
After we ordered our well thought out wine choice we are told they are out of that wine. So we have to make a second choice. We look over the menu and find out our first food choice is not available. Maybe we could have been told what they were out of before we get our minds set for a certain wine and entree. We were there to celebrate a birthday and looking forward to the special complimentary birthday dessert. We are told it will be a chocolate truffle. Yum! The chocolate truffle was salted and was spiced with pepper. What? A chocolate truffle with salt and pepper?,4,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"Reserve is a great addition to downtown Grand Rapids. It is primarily a wine bar with a limited menu, but the food was great.",4,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
"The atmosphere was very business oriented. The clientele was very posh. The house pate was exceptional. The wines were delicious. The bar and dining bar was very noisy, busy, and full of people. The connection with the local sources of food was somewhat disconnected, portraying a dominating presence over nature.",2,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Great exp. especially for someone in the food and beverage industry. Food and ambience was top shelf. Compelling wine list overall a wonderful eveneing. Thank you for the complimentary glasses of Laurent Perrier Rose.,4,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"Myself &amp; 2 others went for restaurant week. Each of us ordered a wine flight &amp; were told they didnt have name cards to identify which wine was what. We had to ask for the specials &amp; were promptly told they were out of multiple items from that menu &amp; the regular menu. After placing our order &amp; having our 1st course (excellent cheese &amp; bread platter), 2 of us were told our main entree was out &amp; she didnt offer alternatives until we prodded her. By desert time they were also out of 2 of the 3 choices &amp; this time she was ready to offer alternatives. Overall the food was great, despite having to change our orders multiple times. Seems to be geared to older, affluent crowd. Will give benefit of a doubt Rest Week caused the issue &amp; try again.",3,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
The food was great but some of the plates were over priced. $23 for gnocchi? Nice wine though.,3,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
This place had great potential but just didn't live up to expectations. The cheese and meat platter was great. But the small plates were just ok. Service was slow and we felt like we were being rushed out the door the entire time. I waited for 20 minute to try and get a refill on my wine (which never came) and we felt like an afterthought to our waiter. Ambiance is great and I would go back for drinks and cheeses/charcuterie but skip the other food.,2,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"The food and wine were great and it would have been a fun spot to just stop in for a glass of wine but as a sit-down dinner place, it was lacking. The lighting was a little too bright and the furniture felt a little like a cafeteria. We sat on a couch type seat with a tiny end table and I thought that's where we were waiting for our actual table for dinner but no, that was it. We definitely didn't have enough room and didn't really feel very romantic for our date night.",4,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Had a lot of fun learning how to order and eat in such a classy establishment. Our waitress was very friendly and personable while helping up through the menus with recomendations.,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Such an amazing restaurant/wine bar... Fantastic Food, Fantastic Wine, Moderately Priced. I felt like I was in a bigger city :)",5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"We loved the wine, the meat and cheese menu were also very good. the bread and spreads that came with it was delicious. However the small plates were disappointing, every one of them. We order a salad, risotto, a fish plate and then dessert. We had a party of 4 and we barely touched the small plates they were that bad, and lets be honest, how can dessert be bad? But it was gross. I would visit again for the wine and cheese, but if they want more people to eat the food, they need to get a different chef.",3,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"We were only there for pre dinner drinks. Great atmosphere and wine was excellent. Our waitress was very sweet and friendly, just not as attentive as we would have liked. I will definitely go back.",3,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"We enjoy trying new restaurants in downtown and we were excited to visit the latest high quality addition to Grand Rapids. Unfortunately, we were disappointed. Things started out with no problem. We made our reservation and when we arrived we were seated immediately. However, a few minutes after we were seated, we were asked to move because another group was going to be sitting and the staff didn’t want to put the group in the corner. We were fine with moving, but the new seat was directly under an A/C vent which was blowing cold air (on a cold night). We ordered a bottle of wine, but after several minutes we were told that the restaurant was out of that bottle. We then ordered individual glasses of wine. We asked the server to lower the ve",2,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Wine is definately the star at Reserve. The flight concept works very well, and the selection is obviously broad and well thought out. Cheeses were very good, but not great. Chutney and comb honey were a good compliment.  The small plates seemed a little spare - not a wide variety of choices, and they were well done but by no means memorable. Food was a bit of a disappointment - we'd expected much and Reserve didn't really deliver at a higher level.  Service was good, but uneven. Overall, good, but not memorable.",3,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Going to the Reserve was a fun experience. LOVED seeing last year's Art Prize picture in there.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"The wine selection was incredible; however, there were no descriptions of the wines...so it was difficult to really know what type of wine you were choosing. Our waitress was knowledgable, though. The food was great, but very SMALL portions. It's a place to have an appetizer and drink rather than a full dinner.",3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"http://bit.ly/cqrMAd The decor was exciting and the staff was very friendly. We had 3 flights of red wine (a good value at $10 each). The wine was really good. We ordered a chess sample plate and split a bowl of soup. We then had two other small plates and finally a salad and chicken for our final small plates. We would have given this place 5 stars but the chicken was way way over salted... we returned it and it was taken off our bill. It was my wife's birthday, and without asking, we received complimentary glasses of champagne. Finally, desert was awesome (apple cake thing with goat chess on top - yum!). Total bill with a 20% tip was $100. We will definitely be back.",4,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"The place is nice, with a fashionable interior. When you are inside, it's hard to tell where you are: Munich, Barcelona, or London. This can be comforting for party-goers. Food is good, but there are better places to dine in Grand Rapids. And it makes a sense. If you are there, you are there because of wine and charcuterie, and your company. The only turn off - cheap looking plastic table mats.",4,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"Good wine selection, with nice choice of price points for all wine offerings. At the risk of sounding provincial, the menu was unusually eclectic and a bit sparse. The tapas-style cheese and meats choices were interesting, with good flavors and fresh presentation. However, portions were small for the price and selection was somewhat disappointing. A special of the nite - rabbit sausage and farm bred quail - was reasonably tasty but again, small bites - especially for the price. The wait staff was pleasant, and attentive, but somewhat affected in their carriage. My overall sense was that Reserve is attempting to be a different, more cosmopolitan dining experience - but is not quite there, yet. I wish them well!",3,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
The wine and food are great. Too bad about the seating. Not sure we'd go again for date night. There is nothing cozy about the place. At first we were sat upstairs on plastic chairs with a short coffee table that was not conducive to an intimate conversation let alone eating a light dinner. You couldn't even get two plates and two drinks on this table. We asked to move and were seated downstairs along the banquette. There was a cold draft coming from the windows and everyone seated on the bench had a coat on. My husband was seated facing the window and was constantly bumped by waitstaff trying to get through the aisle. The tables are so close together that you'll knock over every wine glass trying to get in and out with a coat and purse.,3,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"The restaurant was very new, very trendy and with it. Most patrons were young professionals. Very fun experience with wine flights and small plates. Nice accompaniments for wine, cheese charcuterie, etc.",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Excellent and knowledgeable service, beautiful space, expansive and thoughtful wine list. Lots of energy, but it (thankfully) does not feel like a 'bar'. Nice list of cheeses, and the small plates are tasty and varied. A delightful experience. Highly recommended.",4,svenman7,Detroit
"Really enjoyed the first experience, and look forward to my next visit",5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"We've been waiting for GR to open a place like this forever. Everything is above and beyond the level of standards we have for fine dining and it does not break the bank. Service was on point and are knowledgeable on the entire menu (wahoo Norm!) Memorable wine was the Volver La Rancha from Spain and the Cab from France. Favorite food was the Goat Cheese and Spec, Potato leek soup, pork belly and for dessert was the hazelnut one! I would recommend making a reservation in advance also. We sat on the second level and had a great view of everyone! On our new favorite list to visit and experiment for many more years to come! Thanks Reserve for bringing what we loved from living in Chicago HERE!",5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
I was very excited about the opportunity to experience Reserve. Everything I heard was true and then some. The staff is very professional and are able to give wonderful advice regarding the food and wine offerings. I was especially impressed with the ambiance. I look forward to the next time I am able to return.,5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit

Had dinner at Sandy Point on a Saturday evening.  My wife has some food allergies and they were very helpful.  Server was very attentive and food was fantastic.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Delicious food and great wine selection.  We were not rushed and it was a very relaxing evening to catch up with friends.,5,jam215,Grand Rapids
The hostess who greeted us was very friendly and moved us to a better table..which was nice. I ordered salmon and my husband ordered a medium well steak. Someone comnented their salmon came skin side up and seemed put out by that ~ my came that way and it was a beautiful presentation.  A nice meal. My husband's steak had to be sent back to be grilled longer but was still very pink when our waitress brought it back. He couldn't eat some of it. Our waitress was not very friendly or welcoming at all!,4,OpenTable Diner,Charleston
Amazing food and excellent service. I asked if I could order something off-menu and the chef happily agreed. Will definitely return!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
It was too cold inside. We were uncomfortable the whole time.,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"This was not my first visit to SPBH, however, it was not my best experience, either.  We brought out of town friends to the restaurant this past Saturday evening.  Beforehand I specifically requested being in the more quiet area of the restaurant and yet we were seated in the room where they seat large tables of people - 16 this night.  And it was LOUD and thand live music was LOUD and we weren't even in the room with the band.  Our server was very welcoming and attentive. However we were very disappointed in our meals - very few beets in the beet salad, the hangar steak was flavorless, and the frites were oversalted.  I will probably visit this restaurant again because it is nearby but I'm hoping the experience will be a better one - especially if we bring guests.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids

"Impressive Wine list and we very much enjoyed  our bottle of Zinfandel. The Shrimp and Grits appetizer was a winner! Because we were starting to feel full we decided to split the special $50 16 Oz steak. We also added scallops and an additional side of spinach with the beef. The spinach was very nicely done as well as the scallops, but three med sized scallops for $13 seemed  overly priced. The biggest problem was the steak. We expected much more for $50 and it seemed like a cheap cut. There was some gristle,  plus the  flavor and tenderness was merely okay.  Most importantly, our server was top notch!",3,MWex,Grand Rapids
Sandy Point consistently delivers good food and fine service.,5,Bruce,Grand Rapids
"I wish I could say my latest visit to Sandy Point was fantastic- but the service fell flat. The food was fantastic and surprisingly fast to come to the table.  Everything else was SLOW, forgotten, and lacked friendliness. I'm not sure if our server was a family member of the owner or what- no other reason that he should have been employed here as a waiter.",3,AHVB,Grand Rapids

Disappointing experience. We had made a reservation using OpenTable noting it was our anniversary.  Restaurant was not busy so the hostess didn't bother to look us up when we told her we had a reservation. Server did not seem to know the menu &amp; he was distracted.  Food arrived cold &amp; quality was average at best.   Beautiful location &amp; really wanted to like it but we won't go back.,2,jlpk,Grand Rapids

"Nice local restaurant,  nice staff, good food. All in all a nice dining experience.",4,joni48382,Detroit
Was very disappointed! Over priced for the amount of food !!,1,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"The food is consistently very good and the service is usually good as well. The menu has a variety of options that should please everyone. The only caution I would offer is that when the restaurant starts to fill up the noise level is not ""energetic"" which was the noisiest option above - it is positively deafening. When you are seated near a large table it is next to impossible to have a conversation with your dinner companions without shouting since it seems that everyone else feels the need to scream and there is absolutely no sound abatement in the restaurant - all hard surfaces. This happens every single time that we dine there although we really like everything else about the place.",3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Fun atmosphere - good food choices for vegan and regular eaters - prompt service - nice wine list - we woukdnt hesitate to come again and play some bocci,4,DT777,Denver

It was a little noisy...we had hoped for an outdoor table...but it was great food and a fun time!,5,RebeccaV,Grand Rapids
The food and service were very good.  The noise level was annoying.,4,jackson,Grand Rapids

"From the Hostess to the waiter everyone was welcoming and delivered outstanding service.  Great food, great fun, great place!",5,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
Food is expensive.  Some items are not worth it. Some wait staff are not as attentive they should be at this price. We only eat here because they take reservations.,3,repeatoffender,Detroit
Great date night location with several appealing food options.  Good wine list.,4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"We've enjoyed three meals at Sandy Point this year.  This was our anniversary so we tried some new dishes. My pork with blueberry topping and quinoa was excellent. Not too sweet, great combination. We splurged with some dessert and it was great as well. They have a wide range of entrees from burgers to filet, fish, pasta.  We keep saying we're going to just have something simple but then get tempted by the variety of interesting food. Service has been great every time. Highly recommended.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"We have eaten twice here but won't be back. Salmon was not cooked we left the raw parts on our plates ,the noise level was high. The first time we ate outside and grandkids played in the sand, we had sandwiches it was ok but did not reflect the price.",3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Had never been here before, but it was recommended and I can see why! The food was delicious--best burger I've had in a long while. The mojitos were quite good too.  Nice atmosphere near the Lake. Worth coming from either Holland or Grand Haven.",4,OpenTable Diner,San Diego
Beautiful place to enjoy a meal and relax. Great food great service would hilghly recomend this place.,5,pandrews1098,Chicago
"Had dinner with family, total of 8 people.  All food was great.  Grandkids could go outside and play Bocce ball while waiting for food.  Our waiter, Amanda, was fantastic.  Did not miss a beat. It's our new favorite place to eat.",5,GoodFoodieFood,Los Angeles
Butch's always exceeds my high expectations.  The staff is professional and competent.  Food is A+.,5,Titan65,Grand Rapids
OK experience.,3,AepLkp,Cleveland
"When making the reservation, be sure to specify which side of the place you want: the 9th St side is less formal, and a great place for a burger or beer with friends. The 8th St side is quieter and more formal - think linens and drapes. Tell them which side in the reservation comments. Great food prepared by a team that cares, and served well. You'll pay for it, but Butch's has a great wine list, too! We've been many times and will return often. Friends from London consider this one their favorite places, anywhere.",5,David,Detroit
"The food was excellent, and the wine offerings were superb.  The only hitch was that they were not aware of our Open Table reservation.  But they worked to immediately correct the situation and seat us at a perfect table with a great waiter.  We also got to visit with the wine sommelier who was extremely knowledgeable about the selections.  Upscale dining experience in a small historic town.  Very nice evening.",5,OpenTable Diner,Richmond
Great food and service . This place always shines,5,charlie,St. Louis
"Great, as always",5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Employees were very curteous and friendly. Food was great! The ambiance was great for a business dinner but It would be great for romance too! 💖,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Butch's provided a nice quite environment with great service.  The menu is small but  the wine and food was very tasty!  The atmosphere and servers did  not make you feel rushed.  Is a nice place to spend the evening enjoying a cocktail and meal.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids

Food was amazing! Service was great! Also was fun to pick out our own wine and beer off the shelves/cooler,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
The food was honestly presented and reasonably priced for lunch. The portions are small and the seasoning was a bit bland. Nothing but curiosity of the dinner offerings will make me return.,4,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Enjoyed and great food. Our view was of a hallway so that would have been the only reason I didn't give it five stars.,4,Maddy,Los Angeles
"Yet another pleasant dinner @ Butch's - great food and service, especially appreciated the help from Bruce with wine selection and sampling.  Butches is one of the gems that's a part of the treasure that is downtown Holland!",5,Slmindiana,Indiana
"Butch's Dry Dock is the best fine dining restaurant in Holland. Everything is top quality with great attention to detail.  Drinks, food and service are superb.  Cocktails harken back to an era when bartenders were true professionals.  The ""Real Whiskey Sour"" is fantastic.  The chef is brilliant.   Highly recommend the trout and the grilled Delmonico steak.  They are out of this world delicious.",5,Titan65,Grand Rapids
"We had never been to Holland MI before and several friends and hotel staff recommended Butch's Dry Dock. We had a fabulous experience with impeccable food and service. We met the head chef and owner at our table and assured them that we will be back. Hopefully, soon.",5,DDCarmel,Indiana
Our waiter was very knowledgeable regarding the menu and answered all our questions. Excellent wine list by the glass and bottle.   A quiet restaurant that made for a very enjoyable evening.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Staff was very helpful and courteous. Renee, our waitress, was provided exceptional service. Food was excellent.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Butch's is a great place to eat no matter what my mood. Reliable quality of food and service. Options for dining: casual, formal and outdoor. Great wine and beer list with creative cocktails. Best location in downtown Holland. Perfect for a shopping break or a view of the world walking by.",5,ANNE,Chicago
An excellent salmon dish.,4,Thewire,Grand Rapids
Always enjoy Butch's and this weekend was no exception.  It's festive and lively with great food and wine.  The filet was fantastic and the simple vegetables that accompanied it were excellent...simple in the best way...e.g. the yukon potatoes were roasted to perfection and season in a way that brought out the flavor of the potatoes vs overpowering them.,5,Slmindiana,Indiana
Great ambiance and the food was terrific!,5,Scottsreviews,Detroit
"Dry Dock was a pleasant surprise.... great service, unique menu and sommelier  was great.  only glitch was on Open Table end as my reservation did not flow to the restaurant... the staff were very understanding and rearranged to get us in on a busy night",4,OpenTable Diner,Charleston
Fantastic server!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"The food, service, and ambience were good. No complaints. But we felt the food was overpriced for what we got.",3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"As a foodie, I would highly recommend eating here! If you are looking for an awesome beer with almost anything on their menu try Chimay Grand Reserve (Blue).  A great beer pairing!",5,Foodie,Las Vegas
"Great place to have lunch or dinner.  Went before a show, mentioned that to waiter and food was out in 10 minutes.  So convenient being on Open Table.  Delicious food!",5,HITDoc,Grand Rapids
"Always amazing food, service, and atmosphere! My favorite place in Grand Rapids.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Bistro bella vita is one of our favorites. They never disappoint- you can order a filet, salmon or paella and its all going to be delicious!",4,Nikkidial,Grand Rapids
my fiancé were in town visiting from Chicago for the weekend.  The menu at Bistro Bella Vita looked creative and delicious so I made reservations. I don't know if we went at the wrong time but the service was not great.  It took our server 10 mins to greet us which was strange since the restaurant was pretty much empty.  The manager had to get our drink order for us while we waited on our server.  The food came out fast and was ok.  Calamari was good.  The Paella and Gnudi were both extremely salty.  The Gnudi also had way too many shallots which overpowered the truffle flavor.  All in all it was an ok experience but not worth the price we paid.,3,belangie82,Indiana
"Came to Bistro Bella Vita after friends had recommended it. Loved all the food we ordered, waitstaff was busy but attentive. Tiramisu was the perfect end to the meal.",4,Rachel,Grand Rapids
Food was great. Server was helpful. He had great recommendations. Will be back.,5,TraceyRa,Grand Rapids
Ask for Rachel for your server. She is phenomenal!,5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"Their bruschetta is the best.  Great service, great wine.",4,nickk,Grand Rapids
"Great place for a drink and nibble after work. Consistently good. Favorite dish, the mussels!",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Loved the Polenta starter. We did not enjoy the Paella or Cassoulet. Would give them another chance but would look for cheaper parking. $10 Valet was steep.,3,Svtfun,Grand Rapids
"We really enjoyed our dinner.  This was our second time to the restaurant and we knew this is where we wanted to go for my birthday.  The food and service did not disappoint.  The only thing lacking was we made special note it was a birthday celebration but there was no extra ""treat"" or ""celebration"" about it.  And we didn't want to ask.  The server knew it was my birthday too.  Just would have been a nice touch if they made it a little more special.   All in all a very nice experience.",4,Input,Grand Rapids
"First timed we dined here. It was by far the best restaurant in Grand Rapids. The menu had a nice selection. Food very fresh, local, and good. Interesting dishes that were spectacular. A must try.",5,Jillsey,Detroit
"Really nice find in downtown Grand Rapids.  Food was very good, service very attentive and lively atmosphere.  Menu has great variety with some really interesting options for vegetarians, meat lovers and foodies alike!  Well worth a stop while in town.",4,Reedwell,Atlanta
"I've had business lunches a handful of times at Bistro Bella Vita. I don't think their food or service is up to par of places that I typically go for dinner, although occasionally, they pleasantly surprise me. With respect to the food, they make a range of decent pasta and a few other things, but not a lot of really inventive or interesting dishes - it's more run of the mill bistro food. For business lunches, they're conveniently located, not very busy, and they are more than good enough.",4,Mira,Grand Rapids
"Everything we ordered was outstanding. From the bread, to the main course, to the dessert. Delicious food and great presentation. Wonderful service and great ambiance.",5,abares,Grand Rapids
"Bistro Bella Vita was a great choice to celebrate our 3 year anniversary. As a total foodie, I truly enjoyed the unique and delicious flavors present in our dishes. Portion sizes were decent and service was good. The food really rivaled every part of the experience above all else, you will find the execution of the dish to be near perfect. Would highly recommend to all visitors and residents of Grand Rapids.",5,PleasedCouple,Grand Rapids
"Bistro Bella Vita is a destination restaurant we return to time after time.  They have a dynamic menu of fresh dishes that will amaze even the most critical foodie!  Amazing wine list, desert menu and fantastic service.  You know you have had one very special dining experience when you walk out the door!",5,asovey,Chicago
"We have yet to have a disappointment - wonderful place.  Very accomidating - gluten free offerring was excellent.  I asked for a ""custom"" salad and it was perfect.  Has to be one of our all time favorite places to go.",5,Robert,Chicago
"We have been here a couple of times and love their food. We had seafood gnocchi (a special)  and the broth had so much flavor. The service was excellent, too!",5,jenstoh,Grand Rapids
We went for restaurant week and although the portions were small the food was great!,5,Etreair,Chicago
"As usual, it didn't disappoint! My Mediterranean pizza was fabulous. One of my all time favs. I can't wait to get back!",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
The food was just ok. Portions sizes were large and well presented but flavors lacked balance. Service was attentive- too attentive.  Husbands salad plate was cleared before I was finished with mine. Silverware was set for the second course before we had finished the first course.  We felt like we were being rushed out.,2,DiningDuo,Chicago
It is always great to eat here.  Menu is always fresh and new.,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
our meals were absolutely delicious. The warm spinach salad is amazing and my favorite rotisserie chicken was delightful.,5,PattiS,Grand Rapids
"The food has been delicious each time I came here, however when i came this time my waiter wrote down a different dish than i had ordered and i had to wait for 20 minites to recieve new food while the rest of the table ate",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
We were looking for a place in Grand Rapids to meet friends from Lansing (we're from Kalamazoo) and found Bistro Bella Vita on line with good reviews.  The reviews were true and the place was outstanding.  Will go again when in GR.,5,foodietwinmomma,Cleveland
"Service was exceptional, server was an extension of the menu and very helpful.  Food was amazing.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Bella Vita has always been a favorite! The food is to due to, and the building is beautiful! However, the service has suffered the past couple of visits. The waitress seems to have had a chip on her shoulder both times, and was quite rude and unattentive. With better service, I would love to return to Bella Vita.",2,Spenc08,Grand Rapids
"We had a perfect dining experience at Bistro last Friday night.  We were seated right away, our server was friendly and attentive.  The apps and food were prepared  perfectly.  Thanks!",5,RDKCAR,Grand Rapids
Once again the food was very good.  The North Road Salmon in the Lobster Butter Soup was outstanding.  Our service was impeccable.  We told the server we had tickets for a concert at the nearby VanAndel Arena and she perfectly timed our courses so we never felt rushed and still arrived to the concert on time.  The server was also very knowledgable on wines and paired my salmon with a cabernet that enhanced the flavors.  The noise level is my only complaint which is minor for a restaurant of this quality.,5,MrP77,Cleveland
"The food was superb, even for kids.  The service was impeccable!  A bit too loud for my taste though.. but there was a concert going on at the arena.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"The service was fantastic, they were very fast at getting us our drinks and food. They may have been a little too fast but that could have been because we were the waiters only table. The food was phonmemol and the environment was great! They also comped our desert for our birthday!",5,Recentdiner,Grand Rapids
"What a treat! Beautiful interior, great food &amp; service. The salads were tasty &amp; fresh &amp; the pizza was absolutely my new favorite. I look forward to trying it again for dinner. Tana did a great job of waiting on us. She was knowledgeable, friendly &amp; attentive. Wow, that was a great veggie pizza!",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"We ordered a bottle of Prosecco, calamari, arugula salad, and duck ravioli to share (more than enough for two people and we didn't feel overly full). Each course was perfect. We've never had better calamari--so tender and not overcooked. The salad was perfect for a warm summer night and the duck ravioli was to die for. Absolutely a perfect meal!",5,MINatives,Detroit
First timers to the restaurant.  Recommended by a friend.  Food and atmosphere is superb.  Strongly recommend,5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"My husband and I took our daughter and her boyfriend to Bistro Bella Vita for their birthdays.  They had been there before and really liked it.  The food selection was varied, and everybody in our group enjoyed what they ordered.  The pizzas that daughter and boyfriend each ordered looked amazing, and we look forward to trying those when we return.  The beer menu was huge - I'm not a beer drinker, but even I found something that was fun to try.  My salmon was great, and so was my husband's paella.  Our waitress was very attentive and personable, and the other waitstaff never missed an opportunity to pick up an empty plate or bottle as they passed by as well.    All in all, a very enjoyable experience.",5,grandmafoodie,Grand Rapids
We were first time guests. We will be returning as often as fiscally possible. We saved for several months to enjoy our experience. It was well worth it. Your establishment made a group of blue collar workers feel welcome and as if we belonged. Bravo to your staff. Even with my husbands tattoos everyone was nothing but cordial. The food was amazing and no one left hungry. I would however recommend a more diverse dessert menu unless of course I missed a full menu?,5,missnikki00,Grand Rapids
"We so enjoy the vibrant atmosphere, the awesome menu, and ever changing specials. It's our Downtown ""go to"" for fun, and great food.",5,ReneeV,Detroit
We had not been to Bella Vita for a while and are happy to say its as great as its always been - great spot before a downtown show! We will be back again soon.,4,raoul,Grand Rapids
"OK, so a couple of weeks ago my wife and I celebrated our anniversary at Ruth's Chris. To summarize, it was a great experience and a 5 out of 5 in almost every category. The service was great, the atmosphere wonderful and the food excellent...except for my NY Strip. It wasn't that it was bad, it was just not great. And when paying $49 for a steak at arguably the most well known, quality steak house in America you would expect it to be FAB-U-LOUS.  Then, this past week we ate at Bistro Bella Vita before heading to see ""Phantom"". Now, I have been to BBV many times over the years and there are many reasons it is one of my favorite restaurants. And this time reaffirmed that...in spades. As usual, the service, atmosphere and total experience was excellent. But, for whatever reason I again ordered a NY Strip. And that was when RC suffered a blow.  The steak was perfection. Serious perfection. Done correctly, tender a NY Strip as I have ever had and at almost half the price! Oh, and the cucumber martini is also FAB.   My wife and I were in heaven as we enjoyed the meal and the time together. And personally, I liked the meal much better than the show (don't tell my wife ;^)",5,Jack,Grand Rapids
Food was tasty and service was outstanding. Would recommend this restaurant.,4,Steve,Grand Rapids
"The duck ravioli is incredible, it had a buttery sauce and was very savory. I would definitely recommend it to most friends who enjoy quality food.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"It was a busy, concert night and we felt slightly rushed.  Other than that, it was a typical, wonderful night at Bistro.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"My server dumped some of my martini in my lap well she shook it. Not her fault, but I was very surprised she didn't remove it off my bill. I was once a server and that's what I would have done if it had been me. I've been to Bistro Bella Vita multiple times and will continue to go and recommend it to friends.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Good foof great service thou we felt a little rushed - will go to again.,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Perfect location before a concert at VanAndel!  Got in and out quickly and the food was great.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"First time there, would definitely go back.  Our service was wonderful (Thanks Elizabeth!) the food was amazing as well.  Our server was very helpful for the Gluten Free member of our party, and the Menu had some good GF options. We highly recommend the Cassoulet (with the egg!) and the Paella. They were both top notch!",5,OpenTable Diner,Las Vegas

Preston was an amazing server. He did a great job. He was our favorite part of the dining experience. The food was ok for the price. I was expecting a little more for the price. The drinks were overpriced for what you got.  I was looking for a little more and they just didn't hit the mark.,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids

"Looking for a restaurant to complement a show at Devos Performing Arts Center--close enough to walk to both from parking. Bistro Bella Vito fit the bill, had an interesting menu and good reviews. Seated right away be courteous staff, and Tiffany served us throughout the night. We were very impressed by the serving staff--all were happy, helpful and had a clear and positive rapport. Tiffany was terrific.  Wine list is outstanding, although we'd have preferred more local options (LocalFirst!). The menu was eclectic, diverse and appealing (although perhaps too much kale--but that might've been us!) We did note support for locally produced ingredients--thank you! We chose the mushroom polenta for an appetizer, which could have been a serving, it was so large--and exquisite. The parmesan mixed in with the polenta, topped with mushrooms--outstanding. Oh, and kale. My wife had the chicken marsala with past and I had the boulliabase. Both outstanding choices. Chicken was very tasty and the boulliabase was topnotch. Lobster base with scallops, shrimp, mussels, salmon, potatoes and eggplant (which held the delicate flavors wonderfully), and... kale. It was wonderful. Topped with the delightful dessert feature (one dessert with pour-over coffee for two). We had the no bake chocolate cake with vanilla gelato. It was perfect.",5,OpenTable Diner,Washington DC
Great place for foodies. Not great for conversation. Much to loud.,5,dineman,San Antonio
"First choice for lunch, though this time for business. A smaller select menu offered for fast lunch. Ordering from full menu was fast for me as well. Would definitely return. Good food, healthy proportions.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Bistro Bella Vita never disappoints.  Food was outstanding, service was excellent.  A bit too noisy for our tastes.",4,Maculman,Detroit
This place is the best place to eat in GR,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"I had anticipated an Easter buffet, but it was a brunch with a few special menu items and then the full regular menu.  My selection was very good, but it wasn't what I had thought I was getting.  The entrees were a bit spicy for my elderly aunt, but my son loved it.",3,Foodie42,Grand Rapids
"We don't like buffets, so this was perfect for our family to be able to ""order off the menu"" and to have a great selection to fit every taste.   Excellent service.  Wonderful experience",5,Martha,Detroit
"We went to the Bella Vita for the first time, meeting old friends, and came away disappointed. In general the food was only ok (with some serious problems) but was too expensive for what we received. We started with glasses of wine and calamari, which was the highlight of the night -  very fresh, light and tasty. The pour in the glasses was less than half-full but they charged $9.00. We had the cassoulet and found each kind of meat tasty in its own right, but the dish was not cooked together - it was assembled after the parts had been cooked. This left the slightly uncooked beans bland and not melded with the juices of the meats, as a slow-cooked cassoulet should have been. To compensate for the lack of subtle flavors, the cook added a strongly flavored sauce, which obscured the flavor of the meats and beans. We ordered a side of roasted cauliflower which was mistakenly served at room temperature and not fully cooked. Think crunchy! We wanted some bread, but were surprised to learn that they wanted to charge $1.50 per person for a portion of bread which to us was a violation of a worldwide tradition of generously offering guests a basket of bread and butter for starters. Our service was good, but we felt that we were hurried through dinner by other restaurant personnel who kept trying to take our plates before we were finished, making us feel rushed. We were asked if we wanted desert before we had finished our dinners, adding to the stress. When I objected and said we were still eating, the server said, ""well here are some menus when you are ready"". We didn't feel welcome, didn't feel that the personnel cared if we enjoyed our time there. Our bill for two was $91 before tip, which we felt was too much for the meal we received.",2,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"My second time to Bistro Bella Vita. It was a Friday night so it was relatively busy, and the atmosphere can get a little loud due to the open nature of the place. Service was excellent, food was very good and I would highly recommend this place to anyone interested in an excellent meal.",4,OpenTable Diner,Washington DC
"Bistro Bella Vita is a must stop when we are in downtown GR.  A favorite spot for lunch, dinner or drinks.",5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"We went to Bistro Bella Vita for a special birthday luncheon and it was fantastic. We were in the restaurant at a very quiet time, which was wonderful. The food was unexpected and fantastic. We will return to the restaurant next time we are in town.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
I was in town on a business trip and this restaurant was recommended.  It is convenient to downtown and I was able to walk to it.  Food was steady and service was timely.  Seems like a very consistent place.  Give it a shot.,3,Kyle,Philadelphia
"Great selection of food, all of which was very good. Great place for a date night or a group gathering",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Great birthday dinner. Love the cocktail list and specials board.  The bread was okay, not special, but not bad.  the salad and entree were both great!",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
We appreciated how the waitress had assistance so our needs were met timely. Good customer service and nice decor. The food was excellent and the variety was good. I must go back there were several other items we want to try.,4,Mom8283,Grand Rapids
"Always have specials to pick from so the menu never gets boring! Their homemade pasta dishes are always good, but me and my wife love everything from the duck ravioli to the filet mignon, that is underpriced compared to steaks I've paid more for that weren't as good.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Excellent mussels, entrees were so-so. Bolognese was not up to par. Pork Schnitzel special was perfectly prepared, but the mushroom gravy was not good at all, had a heavy sage flavor that ruined the dish. Service was excellent. A good choice for dinner before a show at Van Andel.",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
A hidden gem. Great choice for people that enjoy exotic flavors. Delicious Persian food.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
I have been very pleased with Shiraz in two past visits... and would have easily given a 5 star performance. This time was disappointing. Rice was barely warm... nothing really hot.  The food has been very enjoyable in the past. Not sure what has happened...,3,BOPLACE,Grand Rapids
"This is our second time eating at Shiraz, the first time was about 8 years ago and we were just blown away by how good it was. We came back, everything looked the same and well kept and the food was equally as amazing. It is very quiet and cozy; just a nice, relaxing delicious meal.",5,SarahK,Denver
"Excellent tasting food, staff very friendly, relaxing atmosphere",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Shiraz has been our go-to restaurant for some time. The Persian cuisine is both special and comfort food at the same time. The wait staff will help novices but are not intrusive. Quality and value for the meal is high and the wine list is quite good for a small restaurant. There is a lot to like about Persian food and Shiraz is a great place to experience it.,5,BobH,Grand Rapids
"I LOVED IT. Amazing food, very exotic!",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Great Pistachio baklava!  Nice spot to eat. We will come again if we are in the area,4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago

Such a great atmosphere and the food is always wonderful! Baklava was a special treat for the birthday girl!,5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"Great all around restaurant.  Be sure to check out what looks like a painting hanging over the principal table in the main dining room, but is really a finely sewn Persian carpet!",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Very good meal with excellent service.  The lamb shank is strongly recommended.,4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"We had a Persian friend visiting who grew up in Shiraz, Iran.   He and his wife both gave the food two thumbs way way up for flavor and authenticity.  The lamb dishes were superb!",5,JimB,Grand Rapids
Our first experience with Iranian food and we were so impressed. The server was knowledgeable and very helpful. Very nice ambiance and wine list too. We had an appetizer that was nice and we each had a Khoresh style dish. Mine was an Orange Saffron Chicken that was fabulous with just a touch of heat to the sauce. My husand's was a Pomegranate Chicken with crushed walnuts and excellent as well. Both were served with Persian rice and fresh vegetables.  The whole experience was  thoroughly enjoyable and we will definitely be going back!,5,LynnR,Grand Rapids
My husband and I had a wonderful time at Shiraz Grille. We expected delicious food and Shiraz delivered! What surprised us was the beautiful interior of the restaurant. Our waitress was knowledgeable and friendly as well. It was a lovely evening with delicious food!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"My wife and I love this place.  We always order the pomegranate chicken, which is amazing.  I also ordered the vegetarian/eggplant dish, which was delicious as well.  If you're looking for something a little different with a great selection of wine/beers, then check out Shiraz.  You'll be glad you did.",5,Brian,Grand Rapids
"This off-the-beaten-path restaurant is one of Grand Rapids' true gems--especially if you like Persian cuisine. You can always tell how authentic a restaurant is when it is patronized by ethnic people who are enjoying their ""native"" dishes. The owner was not only present, but attentive, making sure his guests were being properly served. The wait staff was friendly and efficient, and the cuisine was absolutely wonderful. Combine that with the restaurant's relaxed yet elegant atmosphere, and you have all the makings for a truly memorable dining experience.",5,Tourist,Detroit
"Very good food; though the vegetarian eggplant dish had very little eggplant! The side of rice was really the main dish. Loved what little eggplant there was.  Service was great, everything delivered on time; but there was only one other table at the time, anyway.  The Persian tea tasted like regular tea, though it took 15 minutes to prepare. My husband had a chicken dish, he enjoyed it.  The ambiance was elegant and charming; wish we could've stayed for the belly dancers!",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Outstanding intimate restaurant.  Good value, great service",5,Williamd,Detroit
"The food was great, and also excellent service.  I definitely would recommended this place especially if you are on a date :-)",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Shiraz has been one of our favorite restaurants for several years. The food is incredibly flavorful and they have a good wine list. Prices are about the same as a higher-end chain restaurant but Shiraz is so much nicer. If you like Indian or Mediterranean cuisine, this will be a wonderful change-up for you. Wedding rice is a delicious upgrade.  The desserts menu is not extensive but authentic. Baklava is delicious. The  Persian Ice Cream is homemade, light and fantastic!  Almost everything is gluten free by nature of the cuisine. Many veggie dishes as well. We take our friends here whenever we get the chance.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Great food and you have a choice of smaller portions.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"We had dinner April 21, 2017 for the first time for the author. The food was just delicious and the ambiance enabled us to have quiet conversation. I will go to this restaurant again and again.",5,Michael,New England
Both sampler platters were fantastic! Nice wine list too. Service was top-notch.,5,OpenTable Diner,Washington DC
"This is a real find.  It's well prepared and presented Persian food in a cozy building.  The outside of the building would really fool as to what's inside.  The service is impeccable.  Try it, you'll love it.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Very quick service and attentive and friendly waitstaff. Unique and delicious food. Would highly recommend.,5,OpenTable Diner,New Orleans
Food and service was fantastic!  Definitely will make a return visit.  Highly recommend!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
My husband and I made a reservation at Shiraz for our anniversary. We had read about Shiraz online and we were looking for a place that served unique cuisine. We sure hit the mark! The food was outstanding! The service was great and the restaurant was clean and quiet. We both would highly recommend this restaurant.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Delicious as always!  Food slow cooked and above usual fare at many restaurants.  Nice, quiet atmosphere--attentive and friendly service!",5,Karin,Grand Rapids
"Shiraz Grille has the best Sunday lunch in Grand Rapids, bar none.  This has been our favorite restaurant in West Michigan for over 5 years, and we recommend it without any qualification.",5,DSWALW,Minneapolis
"Another outstanding Sunday lunch with friends.  The food selection in the buffet is diverse and so delicious, and the price ($20) simply can't be beat.  There is always a nice vibe in the place and the owner is so gracious when he sees us.  Can't recommend this place highly enough for the authentic food, relaxing atmosphere, and great value.",5,DSWALW,Minneapolis
We had a fantastic family meal! The Persian food is unique and delicious. Our server was just fantastic! We were delighted to learn that the menu is mostly GF and a peanut allergy can easily be accommodated. Can't wait to go back!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Delicious and beautiful food,out of the ordinary and memorable.  The restaurant is gorgeous and fitting for such an elegant meal.",5,OpenTable Diner,St. Louis
"We think this is the best Sunday brunch going in Grand Rapids.  The selection is varied and delicious, and the price is outstanding.  We love this place and are so happy a restaurant of this quality is in the area.",5,DSWALW,Minneapolis
Service was very good.  Staff was very friendly.  Food was delicious.,4,Tasty,Detroit
"Once again, exceptional and delicious Persian cuisine.  My lamb shank was succulent.  The aroma and taste of each dish was wonderful.",5,DSWALW,Minneapolis
"Excellent food, service, and atmosphere.  Can't go wrong!",5,Foodie,Grand Rapids
"This is the only Persian restaurant in West Michigan, and it is excellent in all respects.  Each dish was unique and slow cooked.  The spices were perfect.  I had the lamb shank, which was outstanding.  So tender.  Good and well priced wine list.  This is a unique and very high quality restaurant.",5,DSWALW,Minneapolis
"The food and service was amazing! They have a huge wine list. Their list is actually a book! The entrées my husband and I had tasted amazing and were well prepared. Desserts were so delicious, it is now my go to cannoli place. It was an excellent restaurant for a romantic date night!",5,snowflake88,Grand Rapids
The Lamb shank..wow..big as a turkey leg...so tasty.  Pasta is fantastic.  side dish was way amazing It was very good,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Really didn't care for my meal.  Thought the bread was way too think and heavy and the oil to sweet.  I didn't like the sauce on what I ordered and my husbands meat was grainy.  Liked the wait staff, they were pleasant but too busy cleaning and setting the other tables around us to pay much attention to us.",3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Service was excellent.  I definitely would not recommend this restaurant to anyone unless they stick to the pasta dishes only.  The salad and petite cannelloni were very good, but both of our  entrees were pathetic.  No flavor and no taste!  I had the hazelnut crusted walleye.  It was mushy and tasteless--not really fit to eat, so I didn't.  My spouse had the lamb shank it too had no flavor.  The prices were quite high, which we are not averse to; however for a $160 meal for two I expect decent food.  Very disappointing indeed.  You might also let them know that a restaurant of this type is really not the place for a loud 3-4 year old.  Not a good experience.",1,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Noto's food was delicious and offered a wide array of options to choose from. The wine list was HUGE. Service was slightly slow but they had a big event going on that day too. The dining room is romantic and great for a date night or special occasion. They also had a band there that set a relaxed tone for the evening. All of the owners were there and had kind words for us as diners.,4,HillaryLNS,Chicago
"This was an unexpected find. The wine list would take you a week to simply read, let alone taste. The food and service were impeccable. I highly recommend this restaurant.",5,DocTee,Grand Rapids
The atmosphere and the food were amazing. It was perfect for a romantic night out. We walked around the place afterwards and really enjoyed the beauty of the whole building. The staff were friendly and very professional.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
The food was average.,3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Food was very good but the service was very very slow.  When you get service like this it kinda   ruins the whole experience.   Took 2 1/2 Hours for Dinner,2,Jake,Grand Rapids
"We  always have a good time when We come to Noto's. The food was Great.  Best of all though was Tom, Cherie and Rick. What a Great Great time!",5,Cher2dine,Grand Rapids
"Our children and families were visiting from out of state and we wanted to take them out to a nice place for dinner. We had two three year olds and a five year old (who behaved quite well in an adult environment) in our group. The staff treated us all with kindness and respect. The food was exceptionally tasty and attractively/artistically displayed, something I have always experienced at Noto's. I almost never order dessert when dining out but they are irresistible at Noto's! And live up to their visual appeal!! Great place to dine!!!!",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
When the food was brought to the table it was cold then they microwaved it until it was hard.  When we complained again we were offered wine opposed to food.  The vibe is not a comfortable vibe and the staff are not very friendly.,2,customer,Grand Rapids
"My wife and I absolutely adore this establishment! Excellent food and drinks, personable and knowledgeable staff. Valerie was excellent this visit! ! Never let down from Noto's family!!!",5,JJennings,Grand Rapids
"I ended up at this place last year when a customer recommended it to me. As I had to be in the same area now, I dedided to go back. The experience was perfect again.  The foo is truly delicious. I am from Europe and find it hard every now and then to find good food at a decent price. At Noto's the portions are perfect, the time in between courses is excellent and the wine list is truly notable. I had an Amarone della Valpolicella 2009. Strong wine, good aftertaste... As diner I starte'd with the filled mushrooms, afther that had the gnocchi and finished with the stuffed trout. As a desert I had the chocolate tart...Amazing dishes all of them. So people when you are in the area and you are looking for excellent food, this is the place to be. I will definitely come bck when I am around. Great job to all of you!",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Our Friend Barbie had a Great! time. All Her friends did too . Great Birthday. Great food. The best was Tom, Chery,  &amp;  Freddie D.  Our Server was very attentive. We will be back!",4,Cher2dine,Grand Rapids
"A nice place to eat, but not one I would choose over trying somewhere new.  The food was not nearly as tasty as it was described or as it or smelled.    Perhaps my wife and I chose the wrong courses, and so for that reason I can't just rank the food as poor across the board.  Temps were off and textures were a miss from expectations.  There was only one chef's special (fried sea bass) which was surprising on a Saturday evening.    The service and atmosphere almost made up for the food; it was not a bad experience but certainly not remarkable in any way.",3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Noto's has a very reputable name and so I thought it would be a win win for my husbands birthday, we were terribly disappointed.  Had calamari as appetizer fried and chewy little flavor no dipping sauce for it either to help with flavor.  We get this as a appetizer all the time and this was probably the least favorite.  Bread came with oil but the oil was not good olive oil could have been doctored to taste better with some spices or fresh parmesan but that wasn't an option, no butter.  My salad was the notos salad it was tart and lacked flavor/presentation.  Dinner was about the same.  Food just seems a little outdated and bland.  Not to put a stereotype on it but I think this is more for an elderly crowd.  We debated on weather or not to waste our time with desert but decided to go for it and picked the tiramisu, good choice, this was by far the best thing we had all dinner.  Staff was extremely friendly and went out of there way to make sure that we were taken care of.  Unfortunately they aren't cooks. :(",2,emken20,Grand Rapids
"Wonderful restaurant, I would reccomend it for anyone. Food was great and our waitress was awesome.",5,Titus,Grand Rapids
"Great attention to detail.  Staff prepared and knowlegable regarding our special occasion we had mentioned in our reservation.  Excellent menu, excellent service and ambiance.  We couldn't ask for anything better for celebrating my mother's 87th birthday.  We will definitely be back for other special (or even ordinary) occasions!",5,Sosodining,Detroit
"We have been there several times , this time for our Anniversary. They are accomodating and allowed us to 'create our own meal'. As long as they have the ingredients, they can make it. One of the owners came by to see how everything was and even put together a nice dessert plate for us. After we were finished eating, we were given a tour of the entire place. If you are ever in the market for a restaurant for any special occasion, this is definitely worth a look!",5,Stace,Grand Rapids
"The service was very good.  We ordered the soup, which was basically a bowl of chicken noodle soup...a little disappointed in that.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Great restaurant for different options from the usual Italian, with a nice atmosphere. Also fantastic venue for weddings and big events.",4,Matt,Grand Rapids
We truly enjoyed our dining experience at Noto's Itailian Restaruant. The food was excellent and the service was wonderful. We will certainly return,5,LoveGillys,Grand Rapids
"Service was a little slow to start, but I think it was because we were there so early and all of the staff had not arrived.  Once additional staff arrived, service picked up.  Food was plentiful and well prepared.  Dessert selection was outstanding - mind you we don't normally order desserts after a meal of these proportions, but really could not resist it this time.",4,Sweeny,Raleigh
"Wow, this place was gorgeous! The restaurant was very beautiful and the ambiance was very nice. My wife loved her meal choices and would love to go back. I loved the salad but the penne with red sauce was a bit ho hum as was the sausage that I got with it. So, overall good but I was bummed that they did not have tortellini, and the red sauce was nothing to go crazy about.",3,Fred,Grand Rapids
"We were absolutely disappointed with Noto's.  We went to hear Martin &amp; Lamm's reunion duet and it was apparent that Noto's could not handle the gathering.  The duet was set up in a banquet room and the acoustics were horrible.  We were seated right behind a big black speaker that blocked our view.  There were not enough menus, so four people got to share one menu which was absolutely pathetic!  They served food to three people out of a party of four.  So, out of etiquette, the three people waited and all got to eat cold food!  The service was horrible....glasses were empty, no silverware, the server never asked how the food was......what a shame!  An expensive shame.....",1,LauraKay,Grand Rapids
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR NICE DINNER!  YOU ARE THE BEST! NATALIYA DEVORE,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Overall it took 80 min to get our meal finished and all we ordered was salad and pasta. Salads were wilted and warm. Recieved wrong style of pasta and it was undercooked but dry as if it was left under the heat lamps to long. The chicken with the pasta was tough and cold. I asked about how long it would take it i sent it back, the waiter told me 20-25min, by then my fiance would surely be finished with his.  Total cost 95 bucks wasted. I was told to have high expectations.. i've decided i prefer olive garder. Better quality more bang for your buck. Attentive and so on. So good luck!",1,trixzkitten,Grand Rapids
Food was delicious. Waiter was wonderful. Went out of his way to help us figure out how to use our coupon with our phone.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Noto's is my favorite place to dine in greater Grand Rapids area.  The ambience is wonderful and the dishes are superb.  The wait staff is very attentive without being overwhelming.  Questions regarding the contents or preparation of any dish are promptly referred to the chef and the wait person relays that information.  There is such a wide variety of dishes to choose from, that everyone's palate should be accommodated and satisfied.  If you have not tried Noto's, you are missing a wonderful dining experience.",5,NaTe,Grand Rapids
"Everything about our dining experience was excellent except our waiter, James.  It took 20 minutes from the time we were seated for him to arrive at our table (and the dining room was about 15% full).  He arrived only after we asked the host to find our waiter, and when he did get there, he had an attitude.  Cocktails and appetizers were served with just a hint of arrogance.  There was considerable delay (another 20 minutes) after cocktails and before our dinner arrived.  Food was excellent, ambiance was outstanding...service poor.",4,Dinner150105,San Francisco
"Our visit to Noto's was prompted by an Amazon Local coupon, and the $30 for $60 made our meal a great value. Our food (rib-eye steak and halibut) was excellent, and our server was friendly and attentive.",5,lakeshorefoodie,Grand Rapids
"Very dated decor.  We were told they moved several years ago from Standard, and it looks like they brought all the old furnishings with them.  On the other hand, their catering facilities in the back used for special events is top notch.  It sort of day &amp; night.  Restaurant so-so, event venue, great!",2,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Very nice atmosphere , excellent food and an outstanding wine list .",5,harryg,Jacksonville
"Tony Noto met us at the door and offered a tour of the wine cellar. The wine I wanted was out of stock but they offered a comparable type, so I was happy with that. Next time we'll try the prix fixe in the wine cellar!",5,Navybikermom,Grand Rapids
"Very good food was served, the wine list is enormous, service is very good too. Comfortable, family owned restaurant is enjoyable and they often have live music.",4,bubbster,Detroit
Ordered a medium rare fillet and it came out raw with a seared bit on the outside.  Then they microwaved it.  Would definitely not suggest this restaurant.  Overpriced and the food at Applebee's is better.  Which is saying that it was pretty awful.  It's decor looks like something from the 70's.,2,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Delightful dinner and the restaurant was private enough to have a great conversation!,5,Kevin,Grand Rapids
"Thanks for the great evening.  I was entertaining some clients from Chicago and they did nothing but rave about the food, service and ambiance of this fantastic little gem in eastern Grand Rapids.  Can't wait to get back and take my wife to this local find!",5,italiansfinest,Kansas City
"Noto's is the finest Italian food in West Michigan.  The family has a great passion for cuisine and for service.  The wine list is more of an encyclopedia than a list, and they have terrific expertise in pairing wine with delicious entrees.",5,PnCKevin,Grand Rapids
"The server was very good but seemed hurried the dining room was very  nice,quiet and comfortable. But I have 1 complaint and 1 suggestion. The suggestion is for me personally I dont like mashed potatoes.You had no rice,no baked potato  or wedges to substitute the mashed potato.The complaint is I drink Red Breast whiskey at home as my stable. What I was served was not redbreast.It burned and was harsh After years drinking it I know the smell and taste.I was told it was Red Breast but that was not correct.It would have been simpler to say you where out.",3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Delicious food, great view.  We will return!",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
I love the Bistro when I want to have good quality conversation - in the Bar Area where the acoustics are good.  The waitress was good - very accommodating.  Sam was dear to greet us and visit us.   It is convenient - easy parking - and just comfy.,5,Pearl,Chicago
"New Year's was a busy night at the restaurant but the staff was wonderful. Very good service.  The food was delicious - it was a special menu.  Dessert was good, too!  We'll be back!",4,LeeB,Chicago
Food was very good for vegetarians!  Best in the area.,5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"I was at this restaurant last week and to be honest, the food and service was a lot better. Probably won't be back for awhile.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Lovely quiet dinner Friday evening.  Soloist playing in the bar area was a nice backdrop, we could still have a conversation but enjoy the music.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
The Bistro is always my number 1 restaurant in St. Joe.  Always a delight and a perfect place to share great food with friends or alone.,5,Lizzzzzzz,Chicago
Everything we had was delicious.,5,CanadianMatt81,Chicago
Waitress was mediocre. Caesar salad was boring.  Asked for dinner salad and got entree salad. Shrimp cocktail was good!,3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Have always enjoyed having dinner here. Food was cooked to perfection.,4,TCDining,Chicago
"Food cooked to perfection, but don't forget to order dessert.   Highly recommending the lemon curd tart.",4,OpenTable Diner,Miami
Great Kobi steak and Scottish salmon. Wine list is superior.,5,Phil,Chicago
"Excellent food, service ambiance and drinks!  A very nice place!",4,OpenTable Diner,Cincinnati
"I dined inside at a window table. Beautiful view of the fountain and the lake. (Outside dining on a balcony/patio is also available). My server, Ann, was terrific. She made several suggestions and I was very pleased with both the entree and dessert she recommended. I highly recommend the S'More Creme Brulee for dessert!",5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"Our poor waitress was the only one working from the looks of it. Service was slow. Two of the breakfast dishes were cold and bland. My beet salad was a mushed up ball of greens with big chunks of beets. It tasted ok but was unappealing. Tables used to be linen covered, lending some elegance--- not on this Sunday. I selected this place for my birthday celebration and was embarrassed to have my out of town family be part of it. On the bright side--- the magical pop tart pastries were amazing.",2,SistasThree,Seattle
"Great venue and setting. Gracious dining without pretentiousness. Menu was varied...small plates, attractive appetizers and outstanding entrées. Deep fried calamari is outstanding blended with onion rings and diced potatoes is an appetizer is equal to an entre. My wife's filet was perfect. Upbeat but conversation friendly. Something for everybody. Beach town so service is relaxed and no need to dress up.  Can't find a thing wrong.",5,Barks1959,Chicago
Good value in St Joes. Food and service were good here. They have a nice spot overlooking the water and some outdoor dining as well. The value was very fair. The tomato soup was very good. Main dishes were nice. My wifes chicken was very good. The steak frites was fine. Would get the chicken over the steak. Coming from Chicago I sometimes forget meet not as good in other places. The Smores Crème Brulee was very good. Overall nice meal and no wait to get in.,4,Northshoredave,Chicago
"Cozy and romantic on inside, beautiful view of Lake Michigan and comfortable on terrace. $5 martini night with delicious cocktails, small menu but tasty varied choices. Young server with standard people skills, with less than expected check in on customers.  Would recommend for food, drinks and ambiance.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"The burgers and fries are delicious!!!!  The service was great, view from the patio was beautiful and our entire experience was a 10.  The botanical martini is amazing too, especially if Kayla makes it.",5,MrsMartini,Chicago
"Great meal, great view, great service!!",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
This was my first time at this restaurant the menu looked appetizing it was probably one of the worst meals I've had in my entire life overpriced and overrated,1,Boggygolfer,Chicago
"Food was very good and the waiter was super personable although sometimes scarce when we needed him.  We were a large group (10) so we were told we had to sit inside instead of outside on the patio as requested (it was a beautiful summer evening for a sunset dinner).  We were naturally disappointed; however, the interior of the restaurant was also very nice.  All things considered, we had a lovely evening.",4,OpenTable Diner,Denver
"Made reservations for 10 people at 10:00am through OpenTable, only to arrive and be told that they stop serving at 10:00am and don't even look at OpenTable reservations until 11:30am when they serve lunch.  What's the point of taking reservations through a service when you're not even serving food?  After showing our confirmation and the time, we were served the remains of their mediocre (at best) breakfast buffet for their hotel guests, but the attitude we were given was that they could have cared less about honoring our reservations.  They pretty much stated so.  The arrogance and obvious lack of  management, not to mention unimpressive food, will keep us and our future guests far away.  There are much better alternatives for brunch in the area (Plank's Tavern) that far exceed this tired and careless establishment.  The only thing they have going is the view from the bluff, and that's not enough to give them my business.",1,Robyn,Grand Rapids
The pork chop was excellent!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Fantastic food good service,5,OpenTable Diner,Nashville
Flight &amp; Nosh Pairing.   Enjoyed the food and the drink. Time it took to bring out the food after the flight was too long. Also recommend bringing the dessert drink and dessert out at the end together.  The drink was to warm and watered down from original.,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"3 of us had a very nice lunch to start the Independence Day holiday .. we were there July 3.   Slow start, we got there at 11:31 am opening and got two offers to get us a glass of wine, but they went off and never brought wine.  Finally an excellent server showed up and got our lunch party going.    BLT is great, burger was excellent, staff is friendly.  We sat on the outside balcony, it's on the second floor of this boutique-looking hotel, and it's very comfortable, sheltered from the elements, a nice overlook of Lake St. with a glimpse of Lake Michigan over the tree line.  The interior looks classy but dark lighting and colors, and not particularly interesting.  But, we'd definitely come back for an outdoor lunch again with the excellent food and friendly service.",4,IllinoisMike,Chicago
Great food. Sat outside on the deck. View is great.,5,AGKCO,Las Vegas
"The food was amazing, The view was incredible... The sun set over the lake during our dinner and it was fabulous. The service was the only thing that needs some help. Our server want that busy but kept disappearing for 15 minute periods. When I went to look for him to get a fork to eat my dinner, he was standing talking to the hostess at the host stand. 😒",4,KitchenofOz,Chicago
"Although the restaurant wasn't busy, we waited an hour to be served brunch which seems like an excessive amount of time.  We requested toast and  were charged $2 for ONE slice of toast -- a ridiculous charge which wasn't divulged at the time of ordering.  Seemed like a nice enough place, but will not return.",3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"We were staying at the Boulevard Inn which is attached to Bistro on the Boulevard. The hotel was wonderful, if you're wondering, but let's talk about the the restaurant. We were celebrating a special occasion and looking forward to a great meal. Our reservation was for 7pm. They were neither crowded, nor even close to full. When we changed our minds and decided to sit outside, it was a big deal. Many people had to be consulted and they seemed angry about it. Plenty of tables were open. What's the problem?? It was kind of hot out there. They have ceiling fans, but they weren't on. Our server was pleasant enough, but excruciatingly slow. Ordered roasted mushroom app and it was pretty flavorless. Burger was dry and flavorless. Steak ordered medium well came out medium rare. It was sent back and 20 minutes later another steak came out rare. Couldn't eat it. Steak was taken off the bill, but it seemed like they were doing us a favor by not charging us for food that was sent back...twice! Folks who were seated after us received their food way before we did. We couldn't figure out how that happened. Would have considered dessert, but it was already awkward with our server and the disappointing meal took 2 hours. We wanted to go. We probably won't eat here again. Bummer.",2,PersonWhoEatsFood,Chicago
"the food was good, pricey for the portion, but good. We love dining outside in the warm months.",4,Wanda,Chicago
The chicken liver pate was over the top. The main course special sable was delicious. The lemon tart desert was wonderful. It was great to see Verne Browne in the kitchen.,4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
It has become our new favorite restaurant. Will return soon. Everything was outstanding.,5,JoeL,Indiana
The Bistro has stepped up its game! The food is creative and fresh. The service has never been better. I would request Ruben for your server. He is always happy to serve and ready to accommodate any request.,5,SimplyGail4food,Pittsburgh
Lovely dining room with a lake bluff view.  Close to downtown.  Reasonably quiet.  We dined on a night that wasn't busy.  The service was exceptional.  The menu was creative and fun.  The food was excellent.  In the summer you can dine outside on a balcony.  This is just a great place to eat.,5,Edward3163,Grand Rapids
"This is the best (and only) restaurant in Harbor Country that features top quality food and an atmosphere where you can hear what is being said at the table.  There's plenty of room, and plenty of good food. They don't strike me as the kind of place that is going to decide to cater to loud drunks instead.  Go now. Go often.",4,HappyToBeSurprised,Chicago
What a great night. Everything was perfect. We absolutely loved the food. The dessert was too die for!!,5,OpenTable Diner,Indiana
"My first brunch experience at the Boulevard and I would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a good place for Sunday brunch. Quality service, great food and decently priced as well. I'll be back!",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Everyone was very nice and the food was outstanding. A place to return to many many times in order to try everything and then return to have it again. I like how the food is homemade and the restaurant is family owned and operated. Beautiful on the inside. Nice candle lit setting.,5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"Noto's is excellent - the food is great, the service is excellent - efficient and not snobby at all. They give sufficient time between courses.",5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
It was overall really good; I was disappointed that there was not enough lamb or beef for the last seating at the Easter buffet. Service was great. Ambience very good.,3,OpenTable Diner,Detroit

"We had Easter Brunch. The breakfast area was good, as were the desserts. The carving table and the appetizers, as well as entree dishes were average. The lamb was too rare, the ham too dry. For the price, we would have expected more gourmet selections, but it was food prepared to serve many. Our experience has been better in the restaurant ordering from a menu.",3,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"Excellent experience, very special place.",5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"the food was terribly bland. $10 salads that were tasteless. $20+ steak that was only good when mixed with a very tasty tomato/pepper cup that accompanied it. $20+ salmon that..just..tasted like salmon, no spice, no herbs, no other flavor to enjoy, even the garnishing veggies were nothing worth eating. we spent nearly $90 with no alcohol and no dessert. granted we did not purchase the most italian of entrees but if you can't cook a new york strip steak medium rare and have it at least taste like steak, then i don't trust you with pasta. though the ambiance was nice and the service was very polite the food left everything to be desired. for italian, there were no herbs, spices or seasoning. we went to Carabba's the next night and loved it.",2,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Everything about this place was great, although both my fiance and I didn't like the salads!! Our Server Jill B. was by far the best server we have ever had. Also was given a tour by Tony Noto himself, which was a very special experience.",5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"Noto's is a great restaurant, my fiancee and I dined in their cellar on our first date and we absolutely loved it, the service was fantastic, the chef prepared a wonderful five course meal for the two of us and all in all a great experience.  This was our second trip and we decided to dine in the main dining room.  The menu was great, my fiancee is allergic to most all seafood, we did have a hard time finding a course that did not have seafood in it.  For the seafood lover, their courses are excellent.  Also, they have a great outside patio and if the weather is nice, definitely dine outside and listen to live music!",4,OpenTable Diner,Dallas
Noto's treats all their customers like royalty -- excellent personal service and professional quality of presentation.,5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Best meal I've had in years!  Treated like one of the family when you are there.  Would highly recommend to anyone and everyone.  Staff is VERY knowledgeable about the very extensive wine list. BRAVO!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Tony Noto was kind enough to give us a tour of his establishment after our dinner.  We were celebrating my parents 52nd wedding anniversary, and I am sure that they will always fondly remember this experience.",5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Noto's always provides a memorable experience on each course of the meal and the wines.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Every year for our anniversary, we celebrate with an evening of fine dining elegance.  Most years, the establishment we visit comes to life when they find out it is our anniversary.  We receive visits from staff, a musical interlude, flowers, free dessert, or some extra special attention.  Notos was polite and we were congratulated by the Maitre'De and our server, but there was nothing beyond that to make the evening memorable to us.  The food was tasty but fell short in a couple ways:  chewy, almost soggy crostini in the bruschetta; and strong, fishy tasting scallops that left me wondering how fresh they really were.  For a dinner over $100 without drinks, it was nowhere near the experience we have had in other local restaurants.",3,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
The service not up to the usual standards. Work on servers. Food was great. Look forward to the wine seller experience. Planning corporate celebration down there. Our corporate people were impressed by the food and tour. Service was less than great.  Main dining room needs something?? Too light? We love Noto's.,5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"Notos always treats their customers like one of the family, only the very best!",5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"Thank you for making Mothers Day a success for me.  The food was great and I enjoyed the wine service.  We have dined there a few times over the years, and every time we cannot wait until the following year.",4,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"It was a little cold in the dining room - they had a door open that let in a cold breeze. Our waitress didn't visit our table very often so we had to ask the man filling our water glasses to get us more drinks. Other than that, the food was good, and the waitress was helpful when she came to the table.",4,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"Excellent and memorable large event (Mother's Day Brunch).  Very diverse menu.  Well balanced flavors, great large scale presentations, very family freindly, prompt and well organized.  Noto's hospitality and excellence helped me create the most memorable Mother's Day, yet. I will repeat the experience again.",4,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"An overall good experience, although both of us thought our meat was overcooked.  My husband ordered ""medium rare"" veal and it was done all the way through.  I ordered my filet ""medium"" and it was more on the done side.  That being said, it did not take away from the taste or the dining experience.",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
A great family run eatery that serves great Italian cusine with wines to match.,4,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"I enjoyed the Easter Buffet experience tremendously, but the atmosphere was not very cozy due because it was held in a very large ballroom",4,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"We arrived early (5:45 pm) &amp; were the only 4 people in the dining area. When sitted; our table was near a long group of tables set for some type of party (near the center of the room). This group arrived about 30 min. later &amp; were very noisy. They should have arranged for this large party to be seated in a corner/area away from the main dinners so the noise level was kept in one part of the dining area. The dining room was not busy and noting the empty tables in other parts of the dining room when we left, we could have been seated in a section away from this large group.  Also, they delivered one of our appetizers burnt; can't believe they would actually serve something so obvious. Our friends didn't return it, but should have.",3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Birthday Dinner,4,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Very romantic seat next to the Fireplace only enhanced the excellent food and spectacular service.  The owner showed us around the facilities and made us feel very welcomed.,5,Connie,Detroit
This was our first time here. The food was very good. The ambience is nice and felt a bit classical. One of the Noto's stopped at our table to talk to us. Really nice guy. You can tell that he took pride and had passion for what they do. I would definitely consider going there again.,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
The wine selection is extensive. Service was very good and the food was fabulous.  We had a wonderful experience.,5,rockford3016,Grand Rapids
"I was so pleased to have had the opportunity to make reservations online.  When I got to Noto's,  they had my name and was expecting me.  I was shown to a very nice table in the dining area and had a wonderful dinner and wonderful dining experience.  The food was superb; the service was the best.  The restaurant lived up to my expectations.  This was not the first time I dined at Noto's, and it is far from the last.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"My boyfriend and I dined here on NYE. I thought it would be a nice change to the more modern dining spots near Downtown Grand Rapids. We were given a very small table near the fire, but also near 3 other couples. The NYE menu was great for meat/game lovers, but not for the vegetarian. We were each given one piece of bread.  The food was served in a matter of minutes. I'm pretty sure they had these meals prepared in a banquet style, because the cream sauce on my dish was congealed and was room temp. I couldn't wait to get out of there. We didn't order dessert, we paid and left. I was super disappointed. Will not dine again.",1,BBBruja08,Chicago
"Delicious food. Friendly, helpful, knowledable waitstaff. And amazing wine selection. One of the best dining experiences I've ever had.",5,Tmek,Grand Rapids
A wonderful dinner celebrating Christmas. Food was great. Setting beautiful. A very enjoyable evening.,5,TWM4,Detroit
"Absolutely amazing food, customer service,  and wonderful server. I couldn't believe we were able to go on a tour of the facility and meet one of the chefs. We were allowed to go in the kitchen and watch them prepare food which was incredible.",5,SamStein29,Grand Rapids
"Was very disappointed with our visit. Was told 10-15 minute wait which turned into a half hour, I went 15 minutes with no drink refill,  waited forever for anything (food order and check).  For being so expensive I expected better service.",2,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Sevice was slow (two servers with 5 total tables) and food was lukewarm (noodles were hard as well).,2,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Absolutely wonderful experience!!,5,Bill,Grand Rapids
"The food and service was fabulous. Tony came and introduced himself and talked for a min. Stuffed mushrooms, veal cannelloni, and the cannoli were all very good. Tons of wine available too, although I don't usually get any. Service is always top notch.",5,Mike,Columbus
"Food was excellent. Restaurant is lovely, though very large and open. The gnocchi was out of this world! The wine list was a book - huge selection and the ones we chose were excellent.",4,Delicous,Grand Rapids
Huge Italian wine list.  Very authentic Italian food.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Great experience. Great food.  Our server was top notch.  Excellent wine list and recommendations.  Only improvement could be the bread that is served.,4,BobF,Grand Rapids
"This was our second trip to Noto's. We celebrated my wife's birthday here and just like the first time, they made us feel at home. Our only difference this time is the stuffed mushrooms appeared to need some more time in the oven. They were pretty firm.  Still tasty, but not what we had expected.  The wife is gluten intolerant and her meal was as well prepared as mine.  She dined on the build your own pasta with Italian sausage.  I had the Veal Parmesan (they have a big name for it).  Very good food.  She was able to take home enough for lunch too.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
We definitely felt the old world Italian charm of this restaurant as soon as we walked in!  The wine list is very extensive and our waitress helped us to select a good bottle of wine for our table.  We all enjoyed our dinner selections with the favorites being Pollo Arrosto and Cavatappi with Lobster.  There was a musician performing in the bar and it was pleasing to hear the music quietly in the background as we were dining.  We will definitely return for another great meal!,5,OutToDine,Chicago
"Yes, it can be described as old, but what's wrong with that. It's not old in a bad way, but old in a way that may be described as deep in tradition, white tablecloths, wait staff that cares about doing a good job and good traditional Italian food.  I wouldn't hesitate recommending Noto's to anyone that isn't caught up in all the latest and newest but those that are looking for a good meal with great service will not be disappointed.",4,Sweeny,Raleigh
Anniversary celebration and decided to give Noto's a try - so glad we did.  My husband had the Cannelloni &amp; I had the Gnocchi - - - absolutely fabulous.  Very flavorful without being over seasoned with salt &amp; garlic - you could taste every layer of flavor - absolutely superb.  Started with Calamari &amp; filled Squash Blossoms and finished with Molten Chocolate Cake.  Extensive wine list and the bartender was very helpful with our selections.  Service was outstanding.  Will definitely make this a regular spot.  Thanks,5,pmm2tmm,Grand Rapids
"Everything was wonderful about this restaurant; we had wonderful service, great wine selection, wonderful service/ food, and a great overall experience. The only complaint we had was the rude people we had behind us who were complaining.",5,Thelewises05,Detroit
The service was amazing and so was the ambiance. My wife and I really enjoyed ourselves.,5,jpjr,Detroit
Barkeeper provided an excellent wine based on my preference.,5,Foodie,Grand Rapids
"food was terrible. Service was slow, Regret coming big time- will never return",1,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Our waiter appeared to be working the entire room, yet he was still quite attentive to us.  Our food was incredible and the portions are perfect as they are described (full/half). The ambiance is a bit dated, but still pretty cool and quite comfortable. The fact that you have several gluten free options, especially since my wife is gluten intolerant, makes this place tops for us. We will be back for sure.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Well dine we will be back. . Unbelievable wine selection.,4,Scottsreviews,Detroit
Great place.  It was nice that Joann and Tony stopped by to say hi and see how we are doing.,5,power2b,Grand Rapids
"Their food is the original recipe classic Italian cuisine.  Large portions, good ingredients, nice service by seasoned servers.  Delicious food, fabulous wine cellar, beautiful facility, appealing music, and inviting attitude make Noto's great.",5,bubbster,Detroit
"The food and service was excellent. The restaurant was was quiet and very nice. Although not a big wine person, it was easy to see they had a wonderful wine list. We tried the antipasti, cannelloni, meatballs, and cannolis. They were all wonderful. Will absolutely be back in the future.",5,Mike,Columbus
We went to Noto's to celebrate our 3rd wedding anniversary.  It was a great experience!  They had a very impressive wine list and our server was very helpful and attentive.  The food menu was also very diverse and gave a lot of options from pasta dishes to meat entrees.  There were several items on the menu that I would have tried.  I would definitely recommend Noto's to a friend and hope to go back again soon.,5,akc12,Grand Rapids
"Service was excellent, food was so so, very pleasant  atmosphere",3,Lewis,Chicago
"Noto's had a great reputation for fine dinning and large private events. I've been there for both, but most recently on a date night with my wife. We were the youngest couple in the facility by at-least 50 years. The atmosphere is straight out of the 80's, It was almost uncomfortable. The food and service was nothing to brag home about. They seem to do a nice job with weddings and private company events. Unless they modernize the restaurant, I won't be going back.",2,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
The food at Noto's is always delicious.  Having Tony Noto stop by was a nice touch.  We had the Formaggio E Maccheroni Di Aragosta and the Bistecca Alla Siciliana and they were both delicious.,5,power2b,Grand Rapids
Service was extremely slow. Wait staff did not kow menu. Food was mediocre at best,1,Anthony,Anchorage
"I've dinned at Noto's awhile ago and decided I'd give it a try again as I've been looking in the area for some really good Italian food.  I'd say the best thing about this place is their wine list, as long as they have the bottles in stock.  They were out of our first two choices so we went with their recommendation and it wasn't that great, but it was only $25 so at least it was a good price point.  The food isn't bad, it just isn't anything special.  We ordered the calamari to start and it tasted like it was fried in old grease.  Next we had their spinach salad, which was a feature for the evening and their Cesar salad, both were delicious.  For dinner I had their chicken dish with mashed potatoes and steamed veggies, again nothing special and something I could easily make at home.  My husband ordered the lobster mac and cheese and it was pretty good, lots of flavor of lobster and big chunks of meat.  All in all it was okay, but not something I'd go out of my way to have again anytime soon.",3,ckluckydog,Chicago
Had a blast celebrating our 38th anv. Love love love our Tom and Cherie. Seeing Freddie D. was a pleasant surprise too. Food was really good also.,4,Cher2dine,Grand Rapids
We have had the best service ate Notos than any other restaurant in the area.  Servers are very knowledgeable about assisting us with picking a perfecte wine.,5,Kashmere,Grand Rapids
"There is no question that this place has fantastic food. My only problem with this place is they sit you in uncomfortable chairs and make you wait.  We waited 50 minutes for the first course, salad.  We didn't get our main course until we were there for 1 1/2 hours.  The ONLY thing Noto's has going for it is the food is good.  Unfortunately, my back was killing me when we left from sitting in their terrible chairs and I won't be back because of it.",4,Flashover911,Grand Rapids
The Noto's are always gracious hosts.  The Formaggio E Maccheroni Di Aragosta was very delicious and a must have if you dine there.,5,power2b,Grand Rapids
"My husband and I decided to try Noto's for a nice, romantic dinner. The ambiance was good and the jazz band playing was nice. The food we got seemed pretty generic, and actually not as good as I expected, given the price. My husband got the salmon, which was cooked well, but along with the mushy potatoes and veggies, it was nothing to write home about. I ordered the poached lobster pasta. The sauce was basically an alfredo with mascarpone. It was very heavy, but had okay flavor. Our server was very polite, though she did not communicate or give us updates as to why it took 45 minutes for our entrees. She only said ""Here we go finally. I'm so sorry about the wait."" All in all, I don't think I would go back, considering it seemed like an upscale and overpriced Olive Garden. Maybe we just came on a bad night.",2,Foodie1,Grand Rapids
"Seven of us dined on Easter Sunday, close to 1:00 pm, including my mother who uses a walker. The space was large and open and accommodated everyone. Food choices were amazing, with PLENTY for everyone, including some new things to try! Incredible flavors, outstanding execution, one can tell there are fantastic chefs in the kitchen. Distinctly American, definitely Italian, and with a touch of Europe, there's really something for everyine. It's a large room with lots of people, yet quiet and comfortable. Service from Aaron was nearly perfect (just a little bit of a wait to cash out). He is poised, attentive and professional. Great to see la familigia too! As Mary, Tony and Santina, Tom and Joann make sure everything is perfect and everyone is happy!  I can't imagine a better Easter brunch anywhere. Don't want to try and find one, either. Thanks, Noto family!",4,Stanford1,Grand Rapids

Perfect Pasta Night!!  Best way to spend a Wednesday night in Holland.,5,Jans,Grand Rapids
Delicious!  Small menu but had a little of everything. Had a quaint table for two. Relaxed dining experience.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"I took my girlfriend there for her birthday and it was a good experience overall. Despite having a couple of my friends not recommend it due to some personal and professional differences, it was a very good date night. I made a reservation and got a good table and they even wrote Happy Birthday on the paper on top of the table cloth. Desert was also on the house for her, which was certainly an added bonus and it was a treat. I ate the house burger on a pretzel bun which was fantastic. It was juicy and succulent, and it had just a pinch of salt on the bun underneath that really enhanced the flavor. My girlfriend ordered the short rib, which while pricey, was delicious.  All and all, without paying for desert, or alcohol, I paid about 50$ for a great dining experience. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good time in a fancy place,  however it's not very kid friendly just because of how upscale it is.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"If looking for a more romantic setting, ask for seating  on the 8th street side of the restaurant.",4,OpenTable Diner,Cincinnati
"The mussels and the duck confit were delicious and I would have given it a 5 star on food, however the dessert...Black Forest cake was dire, the worst I have ever been served.   The cake was dried out, and the icing was awful...perhaps too much time in a freezer?  Too bad because it is the ending your remember best.",4,RaeL,Chicago

"Butch’s is always wonderful.  We can always count on good food, great service and ambiance.  They have a great wine selection and the bartender knows how to make great cocktails.  This is our favorite restaurant in the Holland area.",5,KathyP,New York Area
I was disappointed in the option of vegetarian dishes.  Literally my only option was soup and a salad. Which were both amazing but it would have been nice to have at least two vegetarian entrees on the dinner menu.  Our waitress was VERY attentive without being overbearing. I was thankful that they took reservations on the weekend.   Our server indicated there was a problem in the kitchen delaying our food and brought us complimentary soup while we waited. My leftover were thrown out by mistake and the waitress had a brand new salad boxes for me to go. Which I would have never in a million years expected.  While window seating provided a bit more distance from the other tables - it was chilly- but still great ambiance and motion to the environment without it. Ring overbearing.  The food was beautifully presented and I appreciated knowing the vegetables were grown locally.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Great food. Great place.,5,ab112263,Grand Rapids
We had the short ribs and the trout.  They both were excellent.,5,Barb,Chicago
"First (and will not be last!) time at this delightful restaurant.  Staff was very friendly, from the hostesses to our waiter (sorry, I do not remember names).  Answered our various questions about the menu - we had the two soups, burger, and a delicious salad with apples.  We were celebrating my Mother's Birthday and such a treat when our waiter offered her a dessert - she had the madelines, which were baked and presented warm - absolutely fantastic!! Thank you for the wonderful evening dining experience!!",5,GRFoodie,Washington DC
"We always enjoy our meals at Butch's. Very creative menu items, great wine list and very good service.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Butch's is our go to spot every time we're in Holland. There are always interesting things on the menu and the wide ranging wine selections are reasonably priced.

"Our special occasion was my parent's anniversary. We had an energetic waiter that was attentive, but had little knowledge of the wine's served from their wine list. Food was well prepared and dinners were accompanied by a house salad. The ambiance of Butch's Dry Dock was quiet and comfortable. We would consider Butch's again when dining in Holland Michigan.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Very pleasant service; high quality good; nice wine and drink list.,5,MarkP,Detroit

My husband and I split the scallops w/bacon and the pork tenderloin. Both were excellent!!! It was nice outside so we opted for deck dining which had nice music playing. It was nice they allowed us to upgrade to any salad they offered. We would highly recommend the food here and the restaurant.,5,SharonR,Detroit

"WE LOVE BISTRO BELLA VITA ! EXCELLENT FOOD, EXCELLENT BEER, EXCELLENT SERVICE!!!",5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Overall very pleased with our visit  The service was outstanding despite being very busy. With one exception the food was great.  We had the PEI mussels and they were fantastic.  The bread and salads were way above average.  I had paella.  It was one of the better I have had.  The only dish that was less than satisfying was my wife's fish.  The fish was perfect but it was served over a vegetable and cous cous mix that was served cool.  We both tried it and agreed that what flavor there was tasted more like grass than anything else.  It just did not work.  Despite that we would give them an A for effort and would not hesitate to try them again.,5,worldfoodie,Detroit
"Great steak fairly priced.  Great service, great drink menu.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Had dinner with three others on a Saturday night...very busy and VERY noisy.  The food selection was good, the items were ordered were all terrific (the antipasto appetizer was nothing special).  Only complaint was the wine list had  a very limited selection of whites, and the better ones were all $50-60-70/bottle.",4,Beezer,Grand Rapids
I went there with a group of girlfriends and had a really nice time. The wait for a table and food weren't bad at all but our drinks took a while. The food was delicious!!

"I had a wonderful dinner at Bistro Bella Vita. The paella was plentiful and good. The spices, different meats and rice were all blended well and cooked to perfection. The hostess seated me promptly even though I was 5 minutes late. My orange bellini was good for the soul. Overall I had a wonderful experience. Keep up the good work.",5,Traveler,New York Area
"WeI enjoyed our first experience there this past Sunday night.   Although, we did show up 15 mins late. I phoned in to ensure we were still coming in to hold our table, in which they kindly did.  Our waitress was super courteous n knowledgeable with the menu.  My only discourage was the elapsed time between our appetizer n dinner entrée being a good 20mins+.   We were catching the Kevin Hart show after dinner n wanted to be punctual, so having a nice long dinner wasn't an option for us.   I should have notified our waitress beforehand and maybe our dinner would've have gone smoothly with our schedule. We really wanted to try desserts! :(  Although, 20mins+ between apps and entrée is quite a bit long for waiting on a meal, our waitress was tending to a larger grouped table across from us.  Unsure if we were put on hiatus, forgotten, or if the kitchen was backed up, we will be returning for the full experience minus having schedule conflicts. :)  Thank you.",4,KeNoi,Grand Rapids
"I went there with my wife and brother after they ran in the riverbank 25k that morning.  The food was amazing.  The service was also good.  The only negative was noise level.  A little loud, but overall a nice time.",4,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
I made reservations at Bistro to celebrate my wife's birthday. They accommodated us perfectly. Bar staff went above and beyond by giving us tips and things to do while in GR for the weekend. Best calamari I've ever had!! Would return to Bistro on every visit!! Was very impressed!,5,Jwoody,Grand Rapids
"Four of us selected BBV as our venue for an early birthday dinner for our daughter and, once again, BBV proved to be a good choice. My wife and I consider ourselves foodies and we appreciate being offered interesting, creative options built upon locally sourced ingredients. The Old Fashioned that I was served at the beginning of our meal rivaled my own. All four of us loved the food that we had selected--all dishes were properly executed, artfully plated and delicious. We generally decline dessert but this time I opted for a favorite (bread pudding) and was pleased that I changed my mind.   Our server seemed to enjoy her role as an orchestrator of a excellent experience. We love the ambience of BBV and this last dining experience was yet another in a string of excellent ones.",5,jsbach2306,Northern MI
"The food was wonderful, the restaurant is beautiful and the service was great. It was a little loud in the restaurant so conversation was constrained.

We got the Tomato Bruschetta which was good but then for our main meal, I got the Rotini Con Pollo, which was good and a lot of food, unfortunately my husband did not like it because he was still hungry after he was finished with his food. He got the Four Cheese Ravioli which for $20, should have filled him up! I guess i was just expecting more. Also when you are paying that much for adequate, at best meals, paying for bread that was not wonderful is a bit like a slap in the face.",2,Ledtk1ah,Grand Rapids
The server and service was great but the food not so much.,3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"I visited Grand Rapids to celebrate a milestone birthday, and BBV made the day for me.  The food and the service were outstanding, and they took excellent care of me, even tho' I was a solitary customer.",1,MIssBarbara,Grand Rapids
"One of our favorite downtown dining spots. Varied menu, good beer selection..",4,JDD7,Las Vegas
Food was great desserts were amazing! Service was just a little slow but nothing stopping me from wanting to return and I will return.,4,OpenTable Diner,Indiana
It was great.  The food was good.   We had a child with us so the wait time was way to long for food.   We were there almost 2 hours.    It would be great for adults who want to linger.  I would recommend if you see a small party with kids to move their order up if others are lingering.  Or move the kids food up at least to eat.   Otherwise it was great!,4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Yesterday's is probably one of the best kept secrets in the South Bend / Granger area.  Ambiance is perfect, food was excellent, and the service was terrific. You presented a great experience and   we had a great time for our 7th Anniversary.",5,OpenTable Diner,Indiana
"We went to have an anniversary dinner there earlier this week.  We used this Open Table reservation system.  It let me make a reservation and it confirmed my reservation.  Little to my surprise get to the restaurant and they are closed for tile work in the kitchen.   The food and atmosphere are great....when they are open.  Disappointed in the reservation system since they accepted reservation and never let me know they were going to be closed.  Again the food is great, but was disappointed with the lack of communication.",2,OpenTable Diner,Indiana
"I arrived at the restaurant for my 5:00 reservation, but it was not open. There was a sign on the door stating that it was closed until January 7. They should have indicated this on their website where reservations were recommended through open table.",1,J1008,Indiana

New Year’s Eve!,5,KatG,Indiana
Always excellent food and friendly staff. Owners are very personable.,5,OpenTable Diner,Indiana
"Yesterday's is a unique combination of fun, eclectic ambiance, friendly and cheerful wait staff and delicious food. The plum chicken was wonderful, preceded by second to none french onion soup.  Then came the dessert tray which is an experience of its own. All made fresh each day. The chocolate cake and warm brownie are accompanied with their weight in whipped cream. The brownie also has a pint of vanilla ice cream on the side. Definitely table share portions. They make a good vodka gimlet, too.  If you have never been there, it is a must.",5,BeverlyM,Cancún
Christmas get together,3,OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 22, 2017"
"I had always wanted to try this locally famous restaurant so I insisted that we go there for my birthday. We visited Yesterday's at 5:30 PM on Tuesday, December 19th. I expected the decor to be commiserate with the age of the building; embracing the architecture, but it was reflective of an ""old Hollywood"" motif.   We ordered an appetizer and two entrees.  The appetizer arrived within 15 minutes and was delicious. Our soup and salads arrived soon after. Then we waited. And waited. And waited. Our server (who was new) kept reassuring us that our food would be out soon, and continued to do so for over an hour and a half.   Finally our food arrived...the steak was beautiful and delicious, the baked potato was probably good ""yesterday"" as it was separated from the skin, dry and not even warm. The broccoli was overcooked and also not warm. Someone in management asked how our meals were and I mentioned the cold/old and they replaced the potato and broccoli but they were very much the same cold/old. We realize this is of no fault of the server who did an amazing job of staying on top of our drinks and providing us with updates.   I didn't take the time to read many of the reviews before our visit because I had always heard it was a great place. Maybe there was a series of unusual events that led to this poor experience or maybe this is normal.  We don't intend to find out. We wasted 2 1/2 hours of our lives and $150 of our money.  Yesterday's is obviously ""proud"" of their food (as evidenced by their prices) and from this guest's view, is unjustified.  I am happy to see that Eddy's Steak Shed across the road will be re-opening soon. Much better food and worth the price.",2,MissGruntled,Indiana
"Went here for first time for parents anniversary, very good!  Food, desserts and service all very good!  Will be coming back again!",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
The food is top notch and the service is great.  We always have a great experience here.  The staff and the owners treat you like friends.,5,James,Indiana
Food was amazing! Waitress was brand new but was trying hard.,5,Wife,Indiana
"1/2 hour to get our first drink, 40 minutes to get dessert, 1/2 hour to get check!!!!!!! Total over 3 hours!! Unacceptable!!!!!",2,Peod,Indiana
Waitress was just terrible. Forgot everything we requested as soon as she walked away.  Appetizers we not done couldn’t get my drink right and the place was so crowded and loud you were rubbing elbows with the tables next to you.  They need to take out some of the tables. This is not worth the money they charge.,2,MaryM,Indiana
"Very nice atmosphere, our host was spectacular, he met every need we had.",5,OpenTable Diner,Indiana
A gem of a restaurant with friendly staff and excellent menu Fillers were outstanding,5,BettyJean,Washington DC
We have been going to Yesterday's for over 20 years.  The food is exceptional and the deserts are to die for!,5,OpenTable Diner,Indiana
"Lucky find! We went to the ND football game and we're looking for a comfortable place without an out the door line. Yesterday's was it. Our server Brigitte was terrific and was an added plus to the meal. Several of us had the bacon wrapped filets, all perfectly done, garlic mashed potatoes were terrific. We also had the coconut shrimp that were massive and tasty! The desserts. Are off the charts, apple pie ala mode was outstanding. Plotting how to get back again!",5,JDR1955,Chicago
As usual everything was top notch.  The service and food were excellent.  Yvonne and Bill do an outstanding job.  We go there after ND games whenever we can and will do so again in the future,5,dulac1970,Indiana
Our waiter Brian was great. Food was great! Drinks were great!!,5,Anne21799,Chicago
"Large portions, very good high end selections, prime rib, steaks, halibut, etc and AWESOME homemade deserts that are not only delicious but HUGE. If you want somewhere that’s not a chain and you can make reservations, (that gets packed on Notre Dame football weekends) and can still handle being busy to give you a good experience, then go here. Enjoy",5,OpenTable Diner,Indiana
The best overall dining experience ever. Great food. Great ambiance. Great service. The best desert ever. It was the best anniversary celebration.,5,OpenTable Diner,Indiana
"Many appealing menu items and terrific food. We had salad with prime rib, fish tacos, and chicken with oriental plum sauce were wonderful. Desserts are to die for. World's best peanut butter pie!!!",5,Sundaydiner,Baltimore
"Bistro Bella Vita is always so delicious! The atmosphere is also very nice. They have their regular menu and they have the specials menu so there is always something to choose from that is either in season or just a regular delicious item! I am in love with their fisherman's stew and my husband loves the Beef bourguignon! Our favorite appetizer is the clams. Those are our ""go to"" items, but when I have had any other meal there it has always been amazing as well as all of their desserts and appetizers.",5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"We made a reservation to eat before a concert at Van Andel.  Arrived on time, was promptly seated.  We went through the normal course of appetizer, salad, dinner and dessert - but it just felt like we were rushed to get out - turn over the table, so to speak, throughout the meal.   Server(s) were attentive, but always asking if we wanted the next item, etc.  The restauarant was very nice, little tight with the seating and surprisingly pretty noisy, but overall a good meal.  Thanks.",4,STowell,Washington DC
Ate at Bistro Bella Vita prior to a concert in the neighborhood.  We selected this restaurant based on many positive reviews and all 4 of us were quite pleased with the decision.  Ordered everything from pizza to specials to standard items off the menu and all were of very high quality and consensus was that we made an excellent choice.   Acceptable wine list as well.  Highly recommended.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Food was excellent along with the service.  We will definitely be returning in the near future.,5,TonyR,Grand Rapids
"Great Food &amp; Service, Dennis our server did great.  Good knowledge of the menu and how the food was prepared.",5,Oscar,Grand Rapids
Pleasantly surprised with the whole experience - will return - Seating was prompt and reservations couldn't have been simpler using OpenTable - Atmosphere was cosy - Service was superb - Dishes were delicious and portions were substantial,5,CaffeineZombie,Detroit
"I love BBV. The food is good, the atmosphere is fun, the service is great and it's not a chain. Good for groups or couples.",4,deniseh,Grand Rapids
"Came highly recommended from friends. We re in town for a getaway weekend. This was the perfect spot. The wait was minimal(we were a little early). Everyone greeted us, made us feel welcome. The waitress was fabulous. She knew the menu very well, gave excellent descriptions of the menu items. She was spot on, very friendly and very welcoming. The food was fantastic. I was very sad that I could not bring my left overs home because they were so good. Would highly recommend to anyone.",5,ely0273,Grand Rapids
Great place to go for special occasion or just fun date night. I order off the specials menu every time and have been delighted every time. It amazes me with what the chefs come up with.,5,grfoodie,Grand Rapids
"This was our first time at Bistro Bella Vita and everything was exquisite. We had the Bella Vita Pizza and the Rigatoni Bolognese, both absolutely delicious, along with a few drinks. The service was very quick and friendly. This is definitely a good place for a date night or even just a group of friends. It's right next to Van Andel Arena, which makes it a great place to go to before a Griffins Game!",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Bistro is one of my new favorites! The menu is excellent- from brick-fired pizza to pork medallions--- something for everyone! I enjoyed the chicken pizza on this visit- large enough to share with someone. Great food, good wine and friends....this place is a recipe for a good evening!",5,RoyalCouple,Grand Rapids

"We had a fabulous dining experience, great service and food to die for. We will definitely be going back for special occasions.",1,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Bistro Bella Vita is in a great location.  Their food is quite good, but it is extremely loud.  If you want to have a conversation at your table, then be prepared to shout.  To call the noise level energetic make it sound like the noise is a positive thing.  I wouldn't be surprised to learn that the noise level is harmful.  It is at least harmful to a pleasant conversation.",3,GRRGRR,Detroit
Have dined here many many times and will do so again!,5,Gh0stprototype,Grand Rapids
"It was nice to return to Yesterday's for dinner.  Nice, pleasant atmosphere with great owners.  Food is delicious....can't beat their special desserts.",4,OpenTable Diner,Indiana
We loved the idea that it looked like a house that was converted to a restaurant. We sat down the drink prices are high of an average of $12 . Our waiter was extremely slow at one point another waitress tried to take over our table to get our order. The Food was very delicious and bigger portions for the price you pay but we ended up being there for 2 hours due to slow service and when we got fed up of waiting we spoke to the manager the waiter tried to lie about that he was bringing the check out.,3,OpenTable Diner,Indiana
Yesterdays had great food!  We loved the steaks and the dessert - the wait staff was awesome and the busboys were handsome.,5,queener,Indiana
"This was my first trip to Yesterday's and i was thoroughly impressed with the quality of the food.  The desert presentation was beautiful.  It was definitely pricey, though.  While I enjoyed my dinner, it took quite a while to get our check.  I found out that our server was new. She did a decent job. Despite my positive review, though, I have no need to go back.  For the money we paid, I would much rather go to a more upscale restaurant.",4,Luvsmesomenanas,Indiana
"This was our first dining experience at Yesterdays.  We thoroughly enjoyed it, altho a bit expensive.  We'll definitely return.",5,Delite,Memphis
Food was good. Service was slow and even though we had a reservation they were slow seating us.,3,mbiller,Indiana
After 1 hour at the table the waitress had yet to take our dinner order.  We walked out and went elsewhere.  We were celebrating our anniversary!   PS..rated the food poor quality but I can't say that for sure because we never got any!,1,gopurdue,Indiana
"Service appeared to be determined by our needs.  It was a special occasion and we wanted to take our time,  I saw other tables being served much more quickly.  As far as I'm concerned their food is easily in the top 3-4 restaurants in our area.  And, if you've been there you already know that their desserts are outrageously good (and large.)",5,OpenTable Diner,Indiana
"My husband and I make a point to go to yesterday's for every special occasion. It's a bit pricey but it's completely worth the cost. The service is always phenomenal. If you go there, you definitely want to see the dessert ""menu"" we always take home peanut butter pie after dinner and split it at home as the portion is large.",5,Nicole,Indiana
"The food was good, but the dessert is to die for! I don’t care if you don’t get nothing else in your life, get the dessert!",5,Truthcustomer,Birmingham

"It was very busy with a Notre Dame football weekend, it was a long wait to get everything. Still, Yesterday’s is one of our favorites. Always an amazing experience if you stop in during the week. If on a busy weekend of a game or holiday, just be sure to plan on extra time.",4,OpenTable Diner,Los Angeles
Our daughter is a graduate of SMC and she introduced us to Yesterday's several years ago.  We love it! The food is great and the service top notch.  Carol waited on us and she was wonderful.  We had been to a ND football game which ran long and we were going to be late for our reservation.  I called the restaurant and they were kind enough to hold our table for our arrival.  The food was wonderful and it was a lovely evening all around! I would absolutely recommend Yesterday's for dinner any night of the week.  Dessert is the highlight of the menu.  Homemade and delicious.  Be sure to order dessert and share because they are all good and large portions.  Key Lime pie was our choice and it was as good as any I have eaten in the Florida Keys and I am a regular visitor there.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Food is always great here. Fresh, beautifully presented, large portions. Maybe even too large. Dessert options to die for. I sometimes bring guests just for the dessert. I love the venue and decor. Service is outstanding. All around a great places to bring guests, out-of-town company, and friends or family that you want to treat well. Downsides: depending on the crowd, the place can be noisy to the point of raucous, making quiet conversation impossible; prices, especially for beef entrees, are more than what you would pay in Manhattan.",5,Speedy,Washington DC
Our waiter Tristan was a Valentine's treat.  He was extremely sharp.  He kept both my wife and I on top of our ordering game.  Very knowledgeable and a great personality.  The entire restaurant was on their toes for the big Saturday night Valentine's Day.  I have used open table reservations in the past.  I will say everything time it amazes me the seating preference I am given.  The service is incredible.  Thank you very much.,5,Kona,Grand Rapids
"Bistro Bella Vita has always been a favorite of mine...and they seem to rise to the occasion by providing exceptional service, drinks and cuisine on one of the busiest nights of the year making this a delightful evening.  I also appreciated the valet parking option on one of the coldest nights this winter.  See you again soon....!",5,Manabouttown,Grand Rapids
"The food and service were both excellent. The only down point was it was an extremely cold night and everytime the door opened the dining room was swept with freezing cold air, despite there being both inner and outer doors. Other than that, it was great. I highly recommend it.",5,Diner,Grand Rapids
"I took my girlfriend here for an early Valentine's Day dinner.  We got stuck with a little two seater table that was too close to the neighboring table behind us.  I was bumped on more than one occasion by the wait staff as they were trying to walk past me.  They clearly were just trying to cram as many tables in there as they possibly could.  I saw other small tables in worse walkway positions than ours.  Our table itself was pretty small and it always felt like table top space was at a premium (it didn't help that the wait staff never took away the two unused appetizer plates from our table which seemed odd to me).  The food itself was just average.  And this isn't a criticism against just this restaurant but for most of the ""trendy/upscale"" restaurants in general.  You tend to pay for the ""look"" of the place and not the quality/taste of the food which is unfortunate.  You can easily find greasy spoon or soul food style restaurants with better tasting food options than most of these upscale style restaurants.  My girlfriend had the Beef Cheek Bourguignonne which we both agreed just tasted like standard pot roast.  It didn't have much flavor to it which was disappointing.  I had the Rotini Con Pollo and I would rate it as just OK.  Nothing to write home about.  Oh, and I like how this review site avoids allowing anyone to rank the restaurant as too loud by referring to their loud ranking ""energetic"".  Yeahhh, it wasn't energetic, it was loud.  But you can tell by the inside of the place that the restaurant wasn't exactly designed to mitigate excessive noise levels.  It's definitely not the loudest restaurant I've been in but you always hope for more when you go to places like that.  I will say that our waitress was nice and friendly so I have no complaints there.  This was my first time here so I didn't know what to expect.  I just wanted to take my girlfriend to a nice place.  It was nice enough I guess but it's not a place I'll take her to a second time.",2,Mike,Grand Rapids
"We have always been delighted with BBV and this visit was no exception. Though the restaurant was quite full, our service was attentive and our server really seemed comfortable in his role. All four of us were impressed with the preparation and flavor of our food and my BLT pizza was a real  knockout [the two pieces that went home were enjoyed the following day and reminded me how appreciative we all had been for the experience]. BBV was one of the first fine dining restaurants to open in the downtown area and it really has stood the test of time. We need to go more often!",5,jsbach2306,Northern MI
"My wife and I had visited Bistro Bella Vita three times now.  The first two times we thought the food was amazing, probably one of our favorite restaurants in Grand Rapids.  We went for the third time a few days before valentines day since we will be out of town for the holiday and were pretty disappointed.  The food was okay, but if this was our first time at the restaurant we probably would not return.   However, since we have had exceptional food at Bistro we will probably return and consider our last dining experience an off day for the restaurant.",3,ThirdTimeNotTheCharm,Grand Rapids
Bistro Bella Vita is an extremely nice location. The ambiance has both a romantic and causal feel to it. The food is phenomenal and their beer and wine list is plentiful. The price point is rather high but for fine dining it fits right in and in my opinion is well worth it. The service is also up to par with fine dining. You are not overly bothered by the servers but rarely have to wait when you need assistance. I would recommend this location highly for anyone looking for a great dining location.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids

"What an amazing resturant.. I took a very special young lady for her birthday here and the restaurant accommodated anything we needed. great waiter, our drinks were never empty, also concerned with how our experience was. The food was some of the best I've had in a long time and I definitely would come back. One of my new favorite places to eat.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"This was our first visit to Bistro Bella Vita, and most enjoyable. The wine list by the glass was fantastic. Service was impeccable, thank you Danielle. She was very knowledgeable of the menu and was able to offer recommendations. I had the filet and my husband had the ribeye. Both were prepared perfectly, and I credit Danielle for part of that. When we asked what medium would look like, I could tell that would be too rare, so when I said med-well, she suggested medium +; perfect! We recently moved to Grand Rapids, so we are trying different restaurants and this one will remain on our list as a favorite and a place to bring company.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"It's been some time since I've been back to Bistro Bella Vita, although my wife has been many times for lunch with friends and always raves about it.  We dined there recently just before the Fleetwood Mac concert and were impressed how quickly and efficiently the wait  staff took care of us.  The menu had so many wonderful options, and the food was outstanding with much of the ingredients locally sourced.  This place is an absolute gem.",4,Bbjo,Indiana
The wine list was extensive but pricey.  The beer list had a great selection at a more reasonable price.  This is one of the only restaurant in GR to get really good calamari.  Not chewy or dry.   Our waitress was wonderful.  She was not too chatty but very pleasant.  She had great knowledge of the menu and did not disrupt conversation as she went about the table.  Very tough to do.,4,Grandmaof2,Grand Rapids
Have gone here occasionally for years.  Excellent Martini list!  Great atmosphere.  Food is always excellent.  Rarely any problems.,5,Rockfordman,Grand Rapids
"Bistro Bella Vita is a gem within walking distance of most of downtowns hot spots.  We walked from the hotel to the restaurant and were met with a friendly helpful staff.  Our waitress gave sound recommendations and was able to describe entrees so we could make a good choice.  The food was fantastic, pasta terrific and the dessert to die for.  This would be a great place for a special occasion celebration.  We'll be back!",5,workaholic,Chicago
"We were celebrating my wife getting a new job. I made early reservations for 5:00 via your website. We were greeted by a friendly hostess who seated us at a great table by a window. Our server, Amy, was exceptionally personable, knowledgeable and efficient. She took the time to get to know us, and also to explain and recommend outstanding dinner choices. We will be back, and we'll recommend Bistro to all of our friends and family.",5,GaryMiniCooper,Grand Rapids
My wife and I went to Bistro Bella Vita for our first wedding anniversary. We had reservations but wouldn't have needed them as as the restaurant was in no way full when we went in at 5:00pm on a Sunday. We were seated right away and our server was very quick to take our drink order. She was also very knowledgeable with the appetizer and entree selections and was able to recommend some great choices. The Antipasta appetizer was wonderful as were our entrees. Our server was always prompt with refilling our wine and water glasses and was very pleasant. We even got a free dessert for our anniversary.  We'll be back and will and have recommended Bistro Bella Vita to friends.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"This was not my first time at Bistro Bella Vita, however the food was the best I've had yet. The duck confit appetizer was outstanding, as was the bruschetta. I had the squash ravioli, which was wonderful, and my dining partners had the ribeye and the salmon, which they said were very tasty as well.  The only thing I would not recommend is the blood orange martini (which was on the specials menu). It had very little of anything to make it stand out from a regular martini.",4,Kimiko,Detroit

"This is my favorite fine dining restaurant in Grand Rapids. While steak houses may garner national attention, i prefer the farm to table approach that Bistro Bella Vita offers.",5,Cayenne,Grand Rapids
"The food is great. I recommend getting one of the monthly specials. I had the warm winter salad, which was wonderful. I love the paella. Others in the group had cioppino (rated outstanding), rotini con pollo, and a pasta special, and all were pleased. There are nice wine choices to complement just about anything. My only complaint is that the food came out too fast; once we ordered, our salads were there in 5 minutes, and entrees about 5 minutes behind the salad. The server was clearing plates before we were all done, which is a pet peeve in our family. Some of us had dessert menus before others had even finished eating, which rushes the whole experience. Next time, we'll be explicit about the timing, but we wish the wait staff were trained to be patient. Very friendly and helpful otherwise.",4,thomps97,Grand Rapids
"My husband and I dined with our two kids after seeing the Nutcracker. We ended up getting there early (before they opened), but they let us go in any way and were very accommodating.

Perfect for dining prior to going to Van Andel. Valet parking just around the corner.  Couldn't be better.  The meal was excellent as was the service.,5,Robert,Chicago
"BBV reminded me of the best restaurant I have ever experienced.....the Hazelnut Cafe in tiny Trumansburg, NY, another farm-to-table venue.  The food was fantastic and consisted of ""just-right"" portion sizes.  Very good wine list as well.  The only down spot was I ordered a Chambord martini...........and they just happens to be out of Chambord.  How can that be for a restaurant of this caliber?  Does not require refrigeration and will not spoil.  If it is on the menu they should always have it.  However, the excellent wine made up for it.  Was a bit peeved that you have to pay if you want bread.....for some reason (lotsa wine) we did not.  But on second thought it makes sense.  Why bring out bread that does not get eaten and only have to throw it away?  Good idea, and it is only $1.  Service was very good, attentive but not obtrusive.  We celebrated my wife's birthday after a Trans-Siberian Orchestra concert!  She had the salmon (loved it) and I had the pork tenderloin (scrumptious.). We highly recommend BBV.  It is a bit pricy, but seems to be worth it.  Overall, a very pleasant and thoroughly enjoyable experience.  We highly recommend it to anyone and will definitely be back next time we are inGrand Rapids.  Open Table on-line reservation system worked flawlessly and is a tremendous idea.",5,FlyZip,Grand Rapids

"Had a wonderful meal before walking next door for a concert at VanAndel.  Always a wonderful meal, great service!",5,Matt,Grand Rapids
The restaurant was nice.  We were from out of town attending a concert  and I thought I was booking a quieter more fancier restaurant but we're go with the flow type of people. It was packed and noisey as it was quite hopping with a lot of people at the bar.  Our server was wonderful and very attentive.  The food was delicious.  The only thing I really could complain about was that our table was very close to the outside door and it was cold.,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"We both had a very good prime rib, cooked perfectly. Our waitress was very nice and did a great job, and would have earned  5 stars overall except for the ambient noise there. Something, probably the heating system running was causing a loud hum and vibration you could actually feel in the floor and table which was very distracting. Being a large open area, it's rather loud when they're busy, but that's to be expected. Go for the food, not the conversation.",4,RJ125,Detroit

We dine at Bistro Bella Vita fairly regularly and always leave happy.  The staff is attentive without being annoying and the food is consistently creative and delicious.  We are never disappointed in our selections and find that choosing just one is the dilemma.  A true favorite of all family members.,5,Mstree665,Chicago

Filet Mignon was the best I've had in Grand Rapids. Others had Pork Tenderloin and Seafood Pasta with absolutely no complaints! Make reservations early as it fills up fast on the weekend.",5,Bailey,Grand Rapids
"My wife and I went to Noto's for our Wedding Anniversary and we were very disappointed. The white table cloth on the table was dirty. The white napkin at my seat looked like it was used.  The silverware looked like it was purchased at a Dollar Store. When the server brought out our bread she had 2 plates with her and the bottom one had food crumbs all over it.  The bread tasted like it was warmed up in the microwave.  We ordered the Calamari and it tasted very gummy. The rest of the meal was good. We spent over $100.00 in the restaurant and I thought we would have been able to get a much better experience. I was surprised to see the restaurant was so empty but after going here for the first time,  I now see why.",1,Enjoy2dine,Grand Rapids
"This a nice place, nicely decorated and comfortable.  Menu choice was good and food was excellent.  Service was a little slow as it is also a banquet place and they seemed a bit understaffed.",4,Kiel,London
The food was fantastic and the service was outstanding!,5,1Charliesfan,E. Tennessee
"The food at Noto's is AMAZING.  Fine-dining quality, blended perfectly with home-cooked taste.  Their wine list is extensive, and they also have a fine selection of scotch.  They seem to make most of their money as a wedding venue, and the restaurant itself is usually *surprisingly* empty.  Don't let this fool you, though - the food and service are wonderful.  I recommend this as a nice place to go on a romantic date.  It's expensive, though.  Bring money.",5,catface,Grand Rapids
"We went to Noto's to celebrate or 29th wedding anniversary and we were not disappointed. The food was fabulous. We were undecided between two different bottles of wine. JoAnne Noto was extremely helpful in explaining the differences between the two, even down to the different Regions of Italy they came from. She also had wonderful recommendations for dinner as a paring for each. We will be back!!!",5,Luv2dineout,Grand Rapids
"This was a wonderful dining experience. I had my 13 year old nephew at the table and he was treated well. A good fine dining experience. I asked him on the way home how he would describe the experience and he said ""elegant!"" His parents and foodie uncle (me) agreed!",5,TanisAtTheTable,Seattle
"Restaurant was good.  Food was good, not great - needed a bit more pizazz. The service was outstanding and the owner coming to the table was a great and personal touch.  The ambiance in the building is fantastic but in the main dining room, it needs to be updated.  The wine list is 140 pages of unbelievable Italian wines! The cellar is truly a sight to see.",4,kdamghani,Chicago
Food was good. Restaurant was Classy. But you will end up dropping a lot of money for something that you can get at carabbas.,3,grandvillefoodie,Grand Rapids
This was an amazing experience not only is the service great the wine and food are amazing! They have one of the best wine list I have ever seen. So many Barolo's! Can't wait to go back for a visit. The owners walked to our table and talked with us like family it felt like being back in Italy.  We will be back.,5,CafeyVino22,Chicago
"My husband and I were wanting a romantic place that had really good food, so we decided to try Noto's. I simply had no idea just how warm &amp; romantic the environment would be or just how wonderful the food was. It was an incredible dining experience all the way around, and we will definitely be going back for our Anniversary!!!",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"I purchased a Groupon for $50, which resulted in $100 worth of food. The food was excellent. Our table was right by the kitchen with a lot of traffic of the serving staff. Many tables were available, wondered if because it was a Groupon, that's why we were seated by the kitchen. While speaking to our table of four, the waiter challenged me on the correct usage of a term. We had a great time. Opentable was the best reservation website I've ever used. Awesome!",4,Di9Sig,Detroit
"Whenever we visit Grand Rapids Noto is on our must do list. Good food, excellent wine selection and the waiter was exceptional.",5,Worm,Portland
"This was a great find. The food, ambience and service was outstanding. As we left we were offered a tour of their wine cellar and their banquet facilities by one of the owners. His enthusiasm and friendliness will bring us back.",5,OpenTable Diner,Tampa
"Great food and wonderful service! Tony, thank you for the private tour.",5,Loveit,Detroit
"Recently purchased a home in the area, had some friends visit over the weekend. We were looking for a place to take them for dinner and found Noto's. We had a GREAT time!!",5,Motown,Detroit
"Noto's is one of the loveliest restaurants in the area. It definitely makes a great 1st impression. We went on Valentine's night &amp; the ambience is perfect for that. The rooms were filled with almost nothing but couples.  In short: The service was excellent. The wine list great. My wife's Caesar salad was as bland as Wonder bread. Thankfully, she was able to exchange it for a very good spinach salad.  We are vegetarians who occasionally eat fish. Do note that the menu is limited is rather limited in either. She ordered the mussels &amp; I had risotto with crab/shrimp. The sauce for the mussels was out of this world. I would pour it over anything &amp; enjoy it. I kept sopping it up with bread. My dish was probably a 3.5 out of 5.",3,Rocky,Grand Rapids
"Everything was terrific. Very cordial and accomodating staff, great food and service.",5,Hungrynomore,Detroit
"The menu has variety, but $10 for wilted lettuce is hard to stomach (literally). Eggplant parmesan was doused with tomato sauce to hide the lack of flavor. The lamb was beautifully presented and the duck ravioli was unusual but very oily. The waitress did not listen, and messed up our salad order as well as the wine. The waitress two tables over was so loud, half the restaurant could hear her. Made the ambiance less than pleasant. The owner's son was aimlessly stopping at tables, but ours he just looked at and continued to the next table. The atmosphere the night before Valentine's Day was like a morgue. No one in the bar and the lobby had the strangest odor emanating. We noticed immediately upon arrival.",2,Member,Minneapolis
"We enjoyed a very nice evening at Noto's. Our waiter, William, was very good. Appetizers, soups, pasta and desserts all met or surpassed our expectations. Our entrees were seasoned and prepared well, but were cold or lukewarm by the time they made it to our table. One of us received a steak ordered medium that was still red and cold inside. For the price, we were a little disappointed.",4,4friends,Grand Rapids
"My husband and I were visiting Grand Rapids for our anniversary. We had booked a reservation at Noto's for dinner time. I wanted to surprise my husband, since Italian is his very type of food and I saw there was a jazz band playing there. I had looked up the best places to eat in the area, and decided upon Noto's. However, it didn't work out. The restaurant called us Saturday afternoon to let us know they were not going to be open due to a pipe leak. Needless to say, we were very disappointed. We aren't from around the area and was really looking forward to dining at your restaurant. We made reservations so we could plan ahead. It definitely put a damper on our evening and ruined our plans.",1,NotPleased,Grand Rapids
Reserved this sometime ago to go with friends. Drove over an hour on bad roads. They had a pipe burst in their banquet area so moved the party to the restaurant and did not accommodate us or offer us anything for our troubles. Disappointed over this.,1,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Fantastic experience at Noto's! William was the perfect server; knowledgeable and his timing between courses was impeccable. The food was so authentic. Having been to a cooking school in Tuscany we recognize really good Italian food. The wine list is the most extensive I have ever seen. We will be back!,5,OpenTable Diner,Louisville
Noto himself was horribly rude to our table. I've never been treated like that before and was horribly offended by his behavior. I expect that if I pay that amount for a meal that I be treated with respect. I have told all of my friends and acquaintances not to eat at this restaurant as well as written reviews about the matter. Noto needs to learn how to be respectful of people and that people pay the extra money not just for the food but the experience. I had considered Noto's for a wedding venue but I will take my business else where.,1,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"We celebrated a special occasion with two other couples at Noto's, and we all left wondering why we don't enjoy this family-run establishment more regularly. The menu was extensive and pleasing, and the wine list even more so.  Tommy Noto came by to greet us and give us the tour of the catacomb-like private dining area below, a truly remarkable spot that we have to try some night.  All the members of our party raved about the food, from a selection of appetizers through the main courses and the desserts. And the Mazzoni Toscano Rosso wine was a beautiful choice. Bravo, Noto's! We shall return.",4,Bruce,Grand Rapids
"My wife and I went to Noto's for the first time on January 11, 2014. This was in celebration of our 29th wedding anniversary. We found the atmosphere to be quiet and romantic. It was a great place to go. The staff was very friendly and made us feel welcome, almost like coming home after a long absence. They were very courteous and went out of their way to make the evening a special one for us. The only drawback is that our eyes anot what they used to be and wad to borrow a led light from our hostess in order to see the menu. Overall, we had a great time and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone.",5,Timothy,Grand Rapids
"Had a wonderful dinner with family. Great food, awesome service, reasonably priced. The Friday night we went there was a gentleman playing the guitar. Noise level even with music was perfect.",5,CWey,Grand Rapids
"Dining is still available in Grand Rapids. This is a memorable treat that will satiate all your senses and desires of ambience, service and leisure affording you the enjoyment of a real meal at a relaxed pace and environment .  Mangia!",5,Pino,Detroit
Everyone in our group said this was the best time they had in a long time. Thanks for everything you do,5,Mitchell,Detroit
"My wife and I LOVE not being rushed to order in the casual atmosphere. This was a return visit date night with my wife. We came back because of the excellent treatment we received last year by the family there ,especially by Tom Noto, who had showed us around the whole place graciously complete with the history and quaint stories surrounding The restaurant. We felt like family. It was great.",5,2ndcomers,Grand Rapids
"We had a wonderful experience dining with our group. Our server, William was attentive to the entire group. The meals were delicious and served warm. We all ordered different entrees and each one was superb. We had 11 in our group which included young adults as well. Everyone ordered different desserts which allowed us to sample each others. I would just say the cannolli did not have any flavor. All desserts have a wonderful presentation with fresh fruit.  Thank you for a wonderful evening.",5,Susan,Grand Rapids
Dinner was fantastic. We each had 5 courses which is easy to do with the half portions they offer. The ambiance was nice with a large lit Christmas tree and jazz trio in bar. Owners are so friendly and chatted with us for quite a while. Our experience lasted 3 hours - the way great meals should! Excellent wine selection too.,5,Johnhughmc,Detroit
I mostly come to watch Tom and Cherie Play . We love them&lt;3. The food was good. love all the people who follow Tom &amp; Cherie and Rick .We didn't have our normal sever She went home early WE LOve Her . I think Her name is Sasha. Great with the people.,5,Cher2dine,Grand Rapids
"The wait staff were the most friendly people, we were well taken care of, from the moment we arrived. Great place.",5,JRoz,Grand Rapids
"My wife and I dined on Wed 13 Nov and were extremely satisfied with the cordial greeting and waiter attitude. We were treated very well and appreciated the moderate pace of the serving. I especially liked my Salmon Paste with Artichokes, Asparagus and Tomatoes. I hope to be able to enjoy this Chef's special again on our next visit. My wife thoroughly enjoyed her Chicken Alfredo Paste entree. We ended up in the lounge for desert and coffee while the trio played light jazz. Overall, it a successful evening and we intend to return to Noto's.",5,Ewlohr,Grand Rapids
"Had a terrible experience! Had a 7 PM reservation. No one even came to our table to bring water or acknowledge we had arrived untill 7:30 After ordering two bottles of wine, waited another 15 minutes and were then informed they were unable to locate one of the bottles that we ordered, so they were substituing a diffferent bottle. Politly told wattress that we had been waiting for more then 30 minutes so she sent over the manager who appologized and made all kinds of lame excusses, but never offered to compansate us for anything. I ordered a steak midium rare, when it arrived it was midium well at best, probable more like well done. This was a Birthday celebration that was bad from start to finish! DON'T GO IS MY ADVISE.",1,OpenTable Diner,Palm Springs
We returned to Notos and another great experience.,5,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
Found Notos on the web. Didn't know what to expect. We loved it. The food was wonderful . Very nice selection of wines.,4,BENE,Grand Rapids
"Noto's has good Italian food and authentic atmosphere, but they either are trying to way overdo it, or they are just really too busy with their banquets to keep up with the restaurant. We were seated at our table for 45 minutes before the appetizer was served. Not even their so-so bread to compliment our water and wine in that time. Overall time for dinner for two: 1 hour and 55 minutes (and we took the desserts to go!)",3,TLC2,Grand Rapids
Things starting slow but the staff really made it up and he food is excellent. Grest family ownership Wine list is unreal. This is LA or NYC In Grand Rapids,5,Worm,Portland
"The food was good, the salads were stellar. Our server was gone a few times for a long time when we had already told him we needed to leave by a certain time for a show. He said we'd have plenty of time to leave when we needed to. This was to place our dessert order, and pay our bill.",4,anubis640,Grand Rapids
The restaurant was accomdating for a work dinner. They put us in a great spot to have a business conversation. The food was OK; my canneloni was overcooked and dry and the calamari was greasy but the spinach salad was great. The worst part was the service. The bartender started taking our order and then the waitress took over. After that the service was either incorrect or took too long.,3,OpenTable Diner,New England
"When we arrived I was impressed with the decor, but after the food arrived I lost interest. I had the Caesar salad... Very bland. The bread served had a crust that tasted burnt. I had the ""Spiedini de Carne"" for my main course. It, too, was bland. The cannolli, however, was very good. The server was very nice and seemed well informed. Probably, won't return to this restaurant.",3,Jkoll66,Grand Rapids
"I was considering having my wedding reception there, and so I took my family and fiancee with me to check out the food and overall ambiance. Amazing! The owner took us on a private tour and was really friendly and offered us free appetizers. The staff was very attentive and the food was so delicious! Definitely going to have my reception there and probably come back for anniversaries and such.",5,ohsoyummy,Baltimore
We had a very good experience at Noto's. The service was excellent and food very good as well. It was a weekend night and there was live music in the bar which was a plus.,4,tzap,Grand Rapids
"We were looking forward to a special birthday dinner with my family and received mediocre food at best. The calamari was flavorless and tough...no dipping sauce to offset the dry breading, the stuffed salmon was dry also and the ""dad's favorite"" steak was nothing special. We had a couple of bottles of nice wine, our server was nice and pretty attentive, but none of the food was worth the price tag this restaurant commanded.",2,notimpressed,Grand Rapids
"This was the family's first time to Noto's, and we were very pleased with the entire experience. The atmosphere was very comfortable and the noise level was so low that we could easily hear one another speak. I appreciated the option of choosing between the petite and full size meals. It was also special when the owner Tom stopped by our table to chat with us. We enjoyed talking about some of his memorable trips to Italy. Now that we have finally discovered Noto's we intend to return.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"The food was delicious, we were seated quicky and were offerred our menus and put our drink orders in. My wine was delicious and as I said the food was great but it took us over 2 hours from start to finish for our dinner. You cannot be in a hurry if you have dinner here.",3,123Me,Grand Rapids
"We always love eating at Noto's. We thought from the time we ordered our drinks and the time we got them was quite LENGTHLY. We would have liked to have had a drink FASTER. Also, some bread WITH drinks. We were not in a hurry, but thought the whole meal was SLOW. NO COMPLAINTS....your delicious food makes up for that.",4,Pamipoo,Grand Rapids
"The food was fantastic, and the wine list is huge. I'll definitely be coming back.  I think our waitress was new. Things seemed very unfamiliar to her, but she was very pleasant and eager to please. That's the only reason I didn't rank service as high.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"This was our first time to Noto's. We went on a Tuesday night, so the restaurant was nearly empty and very quiet, but that was nice. I'm assuming the weekends are much more bustling. Our appetizer of mozzarella wrapped in prosciutto was good, but very salty (I guess that's to be expected considering the ingredients). And we had asked for it to be prepared gluten-free, but there were bread crumbs on top. My boyfriend ordered Caesar salad and had asked for no anchovies, but had them all over his salad. Aside from that, everything went smoothly and tasted great. The walleye was delicious, as was the gluten-free chocolate cake. Love the wine selection; it would probably take a full day to look through the entire wine book.",4,KelseyG,Grand Rapids
"My wife and I were both very disappointed in our first experience at Noto's Italian restaurant. We had both heard good things about the place but the service we recieved was lackluster in comparison. We chose to celebrate our 7 year anniversary at Noto's, which I clearly indicated to the staff in my reservation and upon arrival. We were sat in a akwardly quiet room that was being waited on by two servers. The one who handled our table was clearly in his first week of serving food. Very akward interactions and not much help to a couple who had never been to Noto's. The food was good; not amazing, but good. We spent $120 dollars for a ""romantic"" meal and wished the entire time we had chosen one of downtown's many elegant restaurants.",2,DissatisfiedCustomer,Grand Rapids
"Our first time ever in Grand Rapids was absolutely destroyed by the poor service of this waiter. From start to finish, the guy was a disaster. From the flimsy taste of the wine to a lukewarm soup to no broccoli with the order, he couldn't seem to get anything right. He didn't bother even once to ask about how we were doing or if we needed anything at all. A very bad experience, overall.",1,FineDiner,Detroit
"The staff were very friendly and efficient. The environement is warm and comfortable. Overall the food was very good and the wine list is incredible A good choice for a night out, a family occasion, or a group event",5,AJSPKS,Houston
This was one of the best dining places I have ever experienced. The wine list was unbelievable and service was great. The owner took the from his busy schedule and even showed us the wine cellar. When in Grand Rapids again I will definitely want to return.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Notos is my favorite place to eat in Grand Rapids. The food is freshly prepared and always tastes excellent. It has enough tables that it is never too packed, and the service has always been great. They have a huge wine list with varying prices. It is on the pricey side, but I always feel that is was worth every penny after my meal there. The owners always stop by your table to check up on you, and are very friendly. They never make you feel rushed. During our last meal, we sat around drinking wine and then had dessert and coffee while we chatted, and no one pushed us. We ended up being there for three hours because the ambience was so enjoyable.",5,KHeath,Grand Rapids
"Noto's is priced on the high side for the Grand Rapids area. With that said, the wait staff needs to keep up with the kitchen. The food was very well prepared. Kudos to the chef! Service ranged from very good to MIA during our visit on a Saturday night. The wine list is also very impressive, but take note, if you order your wine by the glass you will be served a small portion. Too bad. This is a perfect spot for Noto's to ""wow"" it's customers and it misses the mark. We will return for the food which was an excellent blend of northern Italian and southern Italian cuisine.",4,aaaa,Naples
"This was my 2nd dining experience at Noto's, and both times were fantastic. My wife and I were celebrating our 7th wedding anniversary. The wine list is almost overwhelming, there are so many choices. We went with the server's suggestion, and it was a great wine. The food was once again spectacular. I enjoyed the hazelnut crusted walleye, which could not have been more perfectly prepared. It's not very often that we enjoy fine dining, but Noto's will always be one of our favorites.",5,aladeb,Grand Rapids
"Have been here at least five times, and have never been disappointed. Whenever we are in the Grand Rapids we go here for dinner.",4,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
We always enjoy Notos. The food is excellent and they have a very large wonderful wine list. The desserts are to die for! They have live music in the lounge at the end of the week with various music styles that differ each night. The pride of the Noto family shows in everything from the time you walk in the door to the time you leave. They truely want your evening to be something you'll remember and share.,5,Luv2dineout,Grand Rapids
"Noto's is a ""GEM"" of a place! Everything from the service to ambiance was excellent! Tony was an exceptional host! Thank you for the tour -we thoroughly enjoyed the wine celler portion!",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"We went there for a birthday dinner and had an excellent meal. The staff was very friendly, and more than one member wished my guest Happy Birthday.",4,tzap,Grand Rapids
Went here because we had a gift certificate and I have to say the food was good not great. It was expensive and it was a restaurant that you need to have at least two hours to eat. Im sure it was supposed to be that way but it was not very busy and still took forever. I would not return.,3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Not a great experience or value for our money. I'll keep it short. While I am sure others have had great experiences here we simply did not enjoy our time here. Or server had dribbled wine down the sides of our glass and silver wear on the table, may be a good idea to wrap a napkin around the bottle to avoid the drips. The salads were very bland and tasteless, the entrées were average, the clown next to us was so loud all we heard was his conversation during our entire dinner. Overall we just weren’t pleased and have no plans to return. The highlight was the bottle of wine which we actually did enjoy.",3,Steadycash,Detroit
"The wine selection was excellent but we were divided on the food. The risotto, duck breast salad, and Ossobuco were delicious but the breading on the ribeye entree gave it an odd texture that no one was a fan of. Service was very slow, even for fine dining, and drinks ordered with dinner didn't arrive until after our meal was finished, when we asked our server about their whereabouts.",3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
I love Notos for a wonderful family feel and the most delicious food ever!!!!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Great place to eat and enjoy conversation with that special someone.,4,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"One of our favorite places. As always, the staff was exceptional.",5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Disappointing evening out. Noto's is a beautiful building but beyond that we were not impressed. The constant thud from a banquet room sound system grew very old. Chances are we will not be back.,2,OpenTable Diner,Phoenix
The food a Noto's was wonderful and the atmosphere was relaxing and enjoyable. We will be going back again. We brought some friends and it was their first time and they loved it. Even the one who was a picky eater felt compelled to try new things.,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"While the ambiance and service are wonderful, the food is not. Our third time. First time, fish was fresh and hot with luke warm/cold veggies; second time skimpy soup bland and luke warm, soon cool; cioppino bland with some seafood cool; third time small salmon rolls tasty but overcooked (dry on top), skimpy bland sauce, bland, overwhipped potatoes,all luke warm. Asked why both dishes so tepid, he said didn't know and didn't offer a re-heat. Our thoughts are that the noticeably pre-cooked food is kept low to last.It is a big caterer. Many meats flattened, stuffed, coated and sauced-less meat- easier to pre-cook and hide lower quality? AND, WHAT'S WITH THE NO ICE, TEPID WATER SERVED NON STOP! Stingy and so overpriced. No fourth try.",3,Blondie,Detroit
The food was absolutely phenomenal and the dessert selection was outstanding! I loved sitting near the fireplace on the cold night we visited.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"While a bit over priced for Grand rapids, the food was great, service outstanding.",4,Prymtime,Chicago
As usual Noto's was great! I love the fact that not only is the food fresh and awesome but the owners take te time to stop the table and chat for few.,5,Luv2dineout,Grand Rapids
As always it was an experience not just a meal out. We have never been disappointed. The staff could not be nicer.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Outstanding Service, luxurius surroundings and exceptional food.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Great for a special occasion. Didn't feel rushed. Waiter was very good, left us alone to dine and was very attentive when needed. He was very helpful with information regarding gluten free items. I would definitely return.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Notos is a wonderful restaurant and service starts as soon as you walk in. Greeted by friendly hostess, coats taken. The waiters knowledgable about the menu and if you like wine they have a very large wine list. The food is delicious and it took me right back to my time I was in Italy. The building very much resembling old Italy. I highly recommend going.",5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Very romantic. Service was fantastic! The staff knew the food and wine and were very friendly.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Nice place but way too expensive for the quality of food that we got.,2,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"This was My first time there I was very impressed. The only comments I could give that were not positive had to do with the Waitress and I would not hold that against the restaurant.  The atmosphere was relaxed and warm, staff was attentive. When it came to our meal it was so tastey from appetizer to main course. We had one problem that the Watress, had she asked, could Have easy fixed. Our olive oil was bitter. I prefer a light olive oil And when ordering our main course we should have been given a vegetable and salad but never did.  I realize things happen and will go back but I will speak up if this happens again",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids

The Lamb Shank is the best in the State! A Great value!,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
My husband and I dined at Shiraz New Year's Eve and were delighted with the prixe fixe menu and suggested wine pairing.  It was a lovely evening we plan to repeat soon.  Service was great and the food was unique and tasty.,4,foody,Grand Rapids
"We like the ambiance, we really like the food. Made for a wonderful evening with a lovely lady. Thanks",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Efficient server, well prepared, fresh tasting food. Lovely decor.   From appetizers to entree, flavor was very good.  Only less than perfect part of this entree and  Koreshes previously ordered is that the rice to ""meat"" ratio was  in favor of the rice.   Hostess was friendly and watchful.   Will return.",4,Blondie,Detroit
This place is wonderful.  We had the lamb kabobs which were cooked to perfection.  We will definitely go back,5,Toosalini,Houston
"Was looking for something special to treat my cousin from Arizona.  Great Persian food.  Tried the four appetizer sampler and three entrees.  All were beyond delicious.  Food, service and atmosphere were perfect.  I am a vegen but my wife and cousin are not.  We all left quite satisfied.",5,frenchkev,Grand Rapids
Really a pleasant find.  Highly recommend!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The usual middle Eastern kabobs are excellent, but for a real treat, try one of the fantastic, subtly spiced koreshes.  Yum!  Servers very knowledgeable and helpful.",4,Roy1,Grand Rapids
"I have eaten Persian food before in California, but wasn't aware that it could be found in Michigan. This place has outstanding selection of Persian dishes - everything from the usual Kabobs to excellent vegetarian dishes. Decent wine selection and reasonable selection of craft beers in bottles. Was very quiet for an uncrowded lunch and judging from the size of the room and the ample spacing between tables - plus the beautiful decor - it definitely promises to be a winner for a romantic evening. When we dined there for lunch restaurant wasn't crowded so hard to judge how service would be with a full house - but for us it was outstanding.",5,JohnB,Detroit
If you have not tried Persian food then do yourself a favor and check out Shiraz Grill.  The food is wonderful and of high quality.  The Kashk Bodemjon which is an eggplant appetizer made me change my mind about eggplant.  It is wonderful.  The Orange saffron chicken has a wonderful flavor.  The saffron really stands out and pairs beautifully with the orange and make sure to order the wedding rice to have with it.  Make sure to save room or split Ali's Persian Icecream.  I would go back just for that.    Great food and service.  If you are looking for something out of the normal routine this is a great place to visit.  There are also many nice vegetarian.,5,BillT,Grand Rapids
"This is a place we adore to go. You MUST have the lamps. It's just an ""out-of-this-world"" experience but must everything is worth the expense.",4,Reallyhispanic,Grand Rapids
Food is good.  But I cannot say that some of it is worth the price.  Chef was out of town when we visited so maybe that made a difference.    But for the price there are better options in town.,3,patronizethelocalguy,Chicago

"We always have enjoyed our visits to Shiraz.  It is just up the street but once inside it feels like we have traveled to a faraway land.  The food and service are excellent, not rushed and personal.  They want your experience to be a pleasant one.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"We brought friends who are world travelers...They LOVED everything about Shiraz!  Half way through the meal they said ""we are coming back""!  After a few minutes more they said ""We will have to bring ______ and ____ here for sure!""  We all loved our meals.  I highly recommend the Wedding Rice!",5,RCDC,New York Area

"The food was great &amp; we'll definitely go back! Lots of options for meat eaters and vegetarians. Their rice is second to none! Service was wonderful, even when we decided not to buy drinks. Overall an awesome experience!",5,KJCLES,Grand Rapids
"My husband and I celebrated Valentine's Day at Shiraz.  Although we could have enjoyed their special Valentine's Day menu, we chose our entrees off the regular menu and were not disappointed.  We love the variety of meal choices and will definitely come back again.",5,KayS,Grand Rapids
"The food and service here seem to have declined recently.  The cornish hen was dry (and it used to be my favorite order) and the rice with lima beans seemed excessively buttery on another dish.  The servers are friendly but they are slow and seem untrained.  Still, the soup remains outstanding and the Bodemjan (sp?) dishes are very tasty.  The Persian flavors are a nice change from other similar middle eastern items.",3,OpenTable Diner,Charleston
"Dined here last week on a relatively quiet Thursday and enjoyed a delicious meal.  Our server recommended starting with a 4-dish sampler platter and gave us her favorites.  Next, she recommended the special of the month - Lamb with Curry and vegetables.  My husband devoured it !  Wine list was ok, atmosphere was quiet and staff very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu.  We would definitely recommend Shiraz to others and suggest that they listen to the experts that work there ~ All of there suggestions were right on !",5,Michiganmomma,Grand Rapids
"We have never dined at Shiraz Grille on a weekend therefore judging a ""crowd"" on a Tuesday evening would be unfair. The lamb shanks were delicious, the meat tender and falling off the bone. Our server was knowledgeable and friendly. It was a very nice dinner.",4,Tombie,Western NC
"we were seated immediately.tables and furnishings were cool and seemed new. our waitress was pleasant and attentive. also helpful as we had not had persian food before. my food. to be honest, was bland and lacked flavor and seasoning other than saphron. my wife had  some hotsauce on the side, and i like hotsauce, this was not great. i had the beef tenderloin kabob  and the lamb and pork kabob. the portion size was adequate but lacked flavor. my wife had the chicken kabob and said it was good, i'm glad because it was her birthday. the shimp ordered in the appetizer was good ,although we ordered the four part sampler so they would only give two shrimp instead of five.",3,mcslak,Grand Rapids
"My husband and I had visited Shiraz earlier this year and really enjoyed it so when his birthday came around it was the perfect choice.  This time we brought our teenage son with us and he enjoyed the food as much as we did. The service was outstanding and the waitress is amazing she actually remembered us from our last visit several months ago.  All in all well worth it, I would recommend to anyone.",5,Foodwise,Grand Rapids
I had such a great time at the Shiraz Grille. Everything was done to perfection and the service was above average.,4,RealNice,Grand Rapids
"Our experience at Shiraz Grille was great- the food was well-prepared and very flavorful. Our waiter was very well-versed in everything on the menu which was helpful for us as first-timers there. We had the KASHK BODEMJON as an appetizer and it was awesome. For our mains we had MAHICHEH and GHORMEH SABZI- both were great. The Mahichech is a very large portion- both mains were great choices for a cold winter night.   The atmosphere was quiet and the decor is on the old school side- it's not the youngest crowd. I wouldn't come here if I were looking for a more modern, energetic atmosphere. However, the food and service is outstanding which is why we'll be back.",4,Stellabee,Grand Rapids
"My fiance and I went to Shiraz to celebrate 6 months since our engagement, and we were not disappointed. The food was incredibly delicious. We got 2 entrees, one of which was the pomegranate chicken. The sauce and the sweet potatoes were amazing. The cheesecake had great texture and taste. To top it off, the wine selection was worldwide. Will definitely be coming back :)",5,Francisco,Columbus
"We have dined at Shiraz since it had opened and never had a bad meal. The waitstaff is friendly. Food is authentic and flavorful. Ali, is often seen in dining room talking to guest and smiling. The ambiance is perfect for a setting to visit with your guest. Some places are way to loud not Shiraz. Highly recommend.",5,Chefgrcc92,Grand Rapids
"I went here with some friends and my mom who's from out of town. I decided to try this restaurant out and the food was cooked to perfection. I just don't get how a thing of rice (not plain, but not overly spectacular) was so expensive. I would go here again but not if i'm paying. I don't feel I got the most out of my dollar.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Ate here for a business dinner on the recommendation of trip advisor and the locals. Quite convenient to the Calvin College campus. Authentic Persian cuisine. The Baklava was great.,4,DSReeseMS,Baltimore
"Upscale Persian food, nice setting, quiet, relaxed.  Maybe a little overpriced for what you get -- 6$ for rice??? Food was well presented, and very tasty.  Salted carmel dessert was amazing.",4,timeforeats,Grand Rapids
A group of 5 of us decided to try out the first Thursday of the month for the belly dancing performance.  It was wonderful in every way.  The service was outstanding.  The menu was explained in detail and everyone was excited to try Persian cuisine.  The flavors and variety are exceptional.  The performance was beautiful.  The belly dancer wore several authentic costumes and her movements to the music were lovely.  I had no idea what to expect.  It was a beautiful evening.  I have been recommending it to everyone.,5,BillT,Grand Rapids
"We ate at Shiraz on a weeknight so it was not very busy. There was live music from a violin that was lovely. The food was amazing! We have a lot of experience with Middle Eastern food and North African food so we thought we knew what to expect but it is quite different, the spices were wonderful.  Service was excellent and we had a very nice dinner, highly recommended.",5,Foodwise,Grand Rapids
"Ask for Ann Marie!  She is an excellent server.  Friendly, outgoing and she is a wealth of knowledge on the menu.  This is the second time in the recent past that I have had the privilege of her being my server.  She is patient with anyone that is not familiar with the menu and give's the most wonderful recommendations.  The food quality and flavors are exceptional.  If you have not tried Persian cuisine this will be a real treat.  Saffron, orange, sweet, savory.  Your tastebuds will thank you.  I cannot recommend Shiraz Grill enough.  You will not regret the dining experience.  Make sure to try the Shiraz Khoresh Sampler.  You will be hooked how amazing the cuisine is.",5,BillT,Grand Rapids
The food is of high quality. Any foodie dream. The homemade ice cream is very flavorful.  I have and allergy to almonds and the dish I was looking at had almonds on top and I asked the waitress if they could leave the almond off. They were happy to make sure my meal did not have the almonds. ,5,Specialneedsfoodie,Detroit
"I was apprehensive to dine not knowing what 'Persian Food' was all about.  Let me tell you... Make a reservation! The best, juicy, and most tender kabobs seasoned to perfection!  We walked into a beautiful lobby area and were seated right away.  The staff was friendly  and knowledgeable.  The food was out of this world. I was worried about the price thinking it was on the high side but given the atmosphere, quality, and staff it was worth every penny and more!",5,kdamghani,Chicago
for those who like lamb it's a must go to place in order the lamb hoc  it is by far the best I've ever had,5,customers,Grand Rapids
"Delicious food, superb wine selection and very knowledgeable staff. Love to sit in the lounge and hear great live music.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Great place to have delicious food - most recommended beef wellington, and superb desserts.  Extensive wine list and great service.  True tastes of Italy, great for romantic birthdays and special occasions.  It is very nice when the owners take their time to visit with each table, chat with their costumers, and oversee the operations closely.",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
The meal was spectacular.  This was lovely Italian in every regard.  The sommelier was slow to our table but recovered with a good recommendation.  Noto's has shown a new page.  We were very pleased.,5,milan73mgb,Grand Rapids
Good all around.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago

"Never have had a bad meal ,never had a bad experience at Noto’s .  Always great service great food and a great family.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Food was atrocious to say the least. Anitpasti board was average at best &amp; risotto was literally soup. Completely unacceptable. Wine is the only redeeming quality of this restaurant.,2,Anonymous1,Detroit
Great service and atmosphere.  Our waitress was very personable and was very attentive,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"This was an after Christmas family dinner.  Overall our experience was good.  There were very few people in the restaurant when we dined and we found the temperature in the building to be cold.  Because of the limited number of people, the music coming from the bar was loud and we were not able to enjoy conversation at a normal voice level.  We would not recommend Noto's for a family dinner again especially with teen age children----the menu was not especially pleasing to them.",3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"An exceptional dining experience: attentive, friendly service; excellent food, wonderful ambiance, all perfectly accompanied by live jazz.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Great ambiance. They also have a very neat area for group meetings/dinners.,5,JayS,New York Area
As always fantastic!!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Outstanding food and wine delivered with warmth and professional service.,5,Bruce,Grand Rapids
"Was served meatball with cold, raw meat in the center.  Wine did not arrive until mid-meal because nobody had key to wine cellar.",3,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
I was not allowed to eat because I was wearing a hat.,1,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"The food was only ok, certainly not what I would expect for the price. Also, in my reservation I stated that this was for my mom's birthday. No mention was made. No happy birthday. Nothing.  This is not acceptable.",3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Service was good, but food was not all that good. Not too favorable, bland, did not feel fresh. Was not what I expected. Service was good. At least",3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Great food, service and ambiance!",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
First time eating at Noto's and the food and service were excellent.  I highly recommend Noto's.,5,JimandAmy,Grand Rapids
"The service was great but the food was the star of the night. Amazing!! Very friendly staff, that gave us a tour of the wine cellar and entire restaurant.",5,OpenTable Diner,Orlando
"Great food, good service,  $$$. Plenty of seating. Good for casual or more formal dining.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Noto's is a little out of the way for the general Grand Rapids market but it is an easy drive by using I-96 and 28th Street. The wine list is incredible (regularly recognized by WineSpectator) and there is knowledgeable and friendly assistance for those less familiar with the extensive list of vintages. We tried specials on the menu - both were flavorful and delivered on the promise of their description. However, the standard dishes are of great quality and the selection would satisfy a wide variety of palates. My experience has shown predictably high quality service - friendly, helpful and patient. This is a great room for conversation since the tables are well spaced and the room quiet. I highly recommend Noto's - not the lowest cost but a great value for a great meal. Oh, and save room for desert.",5,BobH,Grand Rapids
I enjoyed Noto's new menu.  I had the pumpkin ravioli.  The new chef came out to talk and that was a lot of fun listening to him.  I wish the decor was a little more modern but I can't eat the decor so I guess it doesn't matter.,5,power2b,Grand Rapids
Pretty expensive for the quality and quantity of food and drink. Not very satisfying overall.,3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Service and food were awesome.  We enjoyed a birthday dinner for one of our guests.  Our server overheard us toast Happy Birthday to one of our guests and after dinner before we ordered dessert, our server comes out with this beautiful dessert with a lit candle  with the words Happy Birthday written in chocolate on the plate.  Our guest was delighted and it was a total surprise to all of us.  Noto's made her celebration very special and memorable.  Thank you to our server and the chef and to the Noto Family for their incredible hospitality.",5,MikeA,Grand Rapids
"Great Food! Our waiter was a bit slow, taking him 20 min to get to our table and another 10-15 to bring our drinks.  However, the bar manager Chad who is extremely knowledgeable, came to our table and helped make our experience fantastic! Definitely recommend this restaurant!",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
We celebrated four September birthdays. Our server was great and she complimented our group. Food was exemplary and the drinks prepared perfectly. The salmon special was voted as the best dish of our group of six. Tony spoke with us and he introduced us to the Hell's Kitchen chef.  A lovely time was had by all.,5,Di9Sig,Detroit
The food was cold and the chicken was not cooked.  sorry this was a disappointment for my wife on her names day,3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
We had a wonderful Birthday &amp; Anniversary dinner. The food was excellent. The owner and the Exuctive Chef took the time to stop by our table to ensure everything was great.,5,Rosevelt,Indiana
"I  dine at Noto's about once a year, and this year took my daughter in for her 50th birthday.  There were 5 of us in our party and we all ordered something different, so that we could sample different plates.  Everything was absolutely fantastic.  Service was excellent.  I did have to order my iced tea twice before I finally got it, but they didn't end up charging me for it.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants a fantastic luxury dinner out with family and friends without having to spend their entire paycheck on the meal.",5,Kashmere,Grand Rapids
"Noto's is such a gem of a place - fantastic food, family owned, and an elegant atmosphere. We are delighted every time!",5,Sarah,Grand Rapids
"Excellent food, excellent service. Cant go wrong here, and the wine list is 42 pages long... you will find something you like here.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
This family owned and operated establishment is truly a gem and Italian foodie nirvana. The meatball was succulent and moist without being overly spiced. We'll worth it as an appetizer and large enough to share for two.  My salad was well seasoned as was my wifes.  The entrees were heavenly my steak was cooked to the perfect temperature and my wife's ravioli was light and the sauce was rich and creamy without being overwhelming. Our desert was over the top wonderful. The tiramisu was one of the best I've ever had.  The wait staff was friendly and familiar with the menu so as to have been able to answer any questions we had. The wine list may seem overwhelming but the Somalia was informative friendly. My family heritage is  Italian so it is difficult for me to find Italian food that I can be satisfied with. This is one of best Italian  restaurants I've eaten at and I would be proud to recommend Noto's to anyone that loves great Italian  food.,5,OpenTable Diner,Seattle
Amazing!!!! Set  the bar for customer service.,5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Great Entre. Small appetizers. Very elegant place. Which they should tell you that. From out of town and felt very underdressed. Everything ala carte. Kinda pricey.,4,OpenTable Diner,Las Vegas
"Our reservation was at 9:15 and the restaurant was almost empty.  The wine we chose from the wine list wasn't available so the waiter gave us something that was supposed to be comparable to our original pick of a $50 bottle of Chianti.  This bottle was not good, the wine was not anything special - it was just below average.  We felt bad to ask for the wine list to choose another bottle on our own since they just brought us a random bottle and said that the owner recommended it.  The food is over-spiced, possibly pre-cooked and just not really that fresh or good.  The decor is stuck in the 80s and there were some flies buzzing around us all night. To add the cherry on top, none of our credit cards were accepted and we were forced to pay in cash due to issues with their card machine.",1,OpenTable Diner,Miami
"Amazing food, amazing service and best wine list I have ever experienced!",5,DLMIII,Grand Rapids
"My wife and I visited Noto's for the first time this past weekend to celebrate our 34th wedding anniversary. We had been in Italy for our 33rd and wanted to recreate some of the culinary memories. Aaron, our server, and Chad, the sommelier, helped us design a 5 course meal that was wonderful. They were helpful and attentive without being overbearing. The food was excellent. The wine parings were spot on. And the pacing was relaxed yet efficient. Highly recommend.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Notos is an amazing dining experience in every way.  From the  extraordinary wine selection, to The beautifully prepared amazingly creative food to the knowledgeable and attentive waitstaff this is the place to be . If you choose to go ,plan on taking some time ,plan on enjoying the meal and eating in course.   Chad the sommelier will help you select and educate you about  a wine perfect for your meal. Whether it's a casual evening out or an evening with that  someone special .  Noto's is it!  Our  thanks to the Noto family for always making our dining there a wonderful experience.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
We have joyed wonderful meals of celebration at Noto's over the years. The most recent visit was with my grandson after his high school graduation. Just the two of us. We could really  talk and enjoy one another's company.,5,Susy,Grand Rapids
"We were there before dinner hour, so our dining experience was quiet and pleasant.  We were surprised at the cost of the food.  I only ordered only a soup.  The décor was a bit dated.  Probably will not go again.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids

"Excellent local, independant restaurant with great food and service.  Highly recommend.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Everything was great! Didn’t care for the cucumber in our water and our first orange juice of the Sunday brunch was warm.  Swatting at nats here I know.  This place is wonderful to dine at and they are very accommodating. Food is the best in Kalamazoo! We love coming here and would recommend it to anyone looking for a fine dinner or brunch experience.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids

Excellent selection of breakfast and luncheon entrees at Sunday Brunch.  Excellent service providing drinks and refills. A very pleasant experience as we celebrated a grand daughters Birthday.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Celebrated a 25th wedding anniversary with family.  Sunday brunch is our favorite and selection and variety is great. Everything from breakfast selections including fantastic custom made omelets, waffles with fruit topping, variety of rolls etc.  Everything else, in addition to breakfast,  included beef, fish, pork and chicken.  Our waitress was very attentive and pleasant.  And the desserts were yummy.  Price is great. Can’t wait to go again.",5,BevB,Grand Rapids
Had excellant service and were able to order something other than what was on the lunch menu. Steak was outstanding.  We’ll be back :)),5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"We decided to go to the Brunch on Sun the 26h of Nov, as it was our 46th Wedding Ann and we hadn't been to Bravo for years. Easy to make a reservation this time and the food and service was great. Surprisingly reasonable cost.  We'll be sure to go again the the future.",5,DavidR,Detroit
"great food and excellent service.  everything was terrific, can't wait to go again!",5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"So nice to have a dining experience that clicked on ""all cylinders"". Server (Anna1) was fantastic. Both attentive and accurate. Mushroom soup was delicious as usual. Duck was tasty and well prepared. Surf and Turf was also very good.  We will definitely return.",4,Didjueat,Chicago
"Bravo's Sunday brunch is still one of the best around. They've held the line on pricing for years now, and the value is still substantial. They've made some changes recently which aren't the greatest--muffins and the like replaced with some kind of pull-apart monkey bread analog, and the fruit is no longer individual slices but rather one big bowl of chunks--but the value is still more than sound for what you'll pay. The restaurant itself is beautiful, with a constantly-burning fireplace as the room's centerpiece. Your view of it, of course, may vary.  A recent change featured cucumber slices in the water, which turns out to be a lot tastier than you may expect and turns even city water into an experience. I tend to prefer lime in the water, but cucumber worked quite well.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"The food is excellent, especially the mushroom soup. Creamy with loads of mushrooms. Service, and more specifically bartender Angie was fantastic.",5,rg77,Chicago
As it has been for 30 years a prime example of a Genuine local gift,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Loved that we could make reservations through Open Table for a large group on relatively short notice.  Excellent food- everyone ate something different and everyone satisfied at the end of the meal.  Couldn't resist sharing several of the desserts- again delicious!  Definitely worth driving across town to get there.,5,Hangry,Grand Rapids
"Food was awesome, just the right portion size,  service was excellent",5,KathyG,E. Tennessee
Had Sunday brunch. Nothing stood out as a must have again. Not a huge selection by any means.  I guess I was expecting more for the $.,4,John,Detroit
Bravo’s brunch is always the best.  It’s a great place to relax and have great conversation.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"The cost of the food was not as good as it should have been for the price, it was only mediocre.  Our water glasses were constantly being refilled, so much that we felt we were drowning. Unfortunately, our waitress was not as attentive.  She was not available to wait on us when we needed anything, refill on coffee, dessert menu, etc. One of our party asked for the dessert menu when we first sat down but we never did get it until we asked TWO more times at the end of our meal! And it was not because the place was busy, there were only two or three other tables occupied. Will probably never go back unless I am forced.",2,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
It’s a real treat to go to their Sunday Brunch. We also have Thanksgiving reservations for the first time this year &amp; looking forward to the meal.,5,BrianM,Detroit

We had a great dinner prior to seeing a show at Miller auditorium. They were very accommodating with altering entrees to meet our vegetarian requests. We were very pleased.,5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Their whitefish and wild mushroom risotto are both outstanding.,5,JeJo,Grand Rapids
"My wife and I went there for our Anniversary. We are from out of town and picked this restaurant from previous reviews. This is by far the best food we have eaten. I had the Surf and Turf, The steak melted in my mouth along with the great flavor from the Lobster tail. My wife had the special Mac and Cheese. She stated this was the best she had ever had bar none. Just the correct amount of cheese and flavor.  Would highly recommend going to tis restaurant. I know we will next time we are in the area.",5,OpenTable Diner,Toledo
"BRAVO? Never disappoints. Everything is top notch. Great atmosphere, staff and  food!",5,J9Kzoo,Grand Rapids
I was disappointed with the quality of the food. It was okay but not memorable. It was typical buffet fare. I have dined at Bravo on numerous occasions and the food and experience has always been outstanding. This was my first time for their brunch service and I was expecting more.,3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Always a great experience at Bravo for their Sunday brunch. And to make the day more perfect, we had the assistance of Patrick to take care of us. Thanks to all at Bravo. You are why we are repeat diners!",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Brunch was wonderful.  A good variety of food and it all tasted great!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"We brought in some New friends of ours. Their first time to the restaurant. We absolutely love Bravo’s and talked them up to our friends.  BraVo’s went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable, Lindsay was very Knowledgeable with her Whiskey/Bourbons , our guest didn’t have to wait to “check with the bartender” like some places.  Our dirty martini’s  were spot on! Our guests enjoyed their Lobster Ravioli &amp; Calamari  , and then Salmon and Duck. He said this is his new favorite place for duck. He’s searched everywhere. Chef Cody knocked it out of the park with the Scallop Special! And Chef Joe was kind enough to bring them out and say hi and took excellent care of us! Joe also brought out an amazing ribeye for us! Host/hostess were very friendly !  Natasha was very attentive with clearing plates and make sure our water was filled.  Also took some time to chat to get to know us better. We and our guests LOVE LOVE LOVED EVERYTHING!! We will obviously be back , but our new guests will now be more frequent guests ! :))",5,OpenTable Diner,Jacksonville
"Bravo! provides consistently excellent cuisine in a charming setting.  Highlights are their wood-fired pizzas, their mushroom soup, their in-house brewed craft beers, they're pasta dishes....the list goes on....never had a disappointing meal there.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"I had never been here, but had always heard it was good.  We decided to try it for a birthday celebration. Service was outstanding and the food was delicious.  I had the scallop special with risotto.   The only thing I'd question was the value. Three scallops (and the risotto) for $28?  These were standard size  1 to 1 1/2 inch scallops, not giant ones.  That seems a little on the meager side.  Don't expect monster portions, but again, 3 seemed like not enough for the price when everything else is ala carte.  My husband had lasagna which was also delicious, and better proportioned.   I'd definitely go there again, but would not order that dish the second time around.",4,OpenTable Diner,Orange County
"Our waiter was excellent! Told the restaurant in the reservation notes that we were celebrating our 2-year anniversary, and also requested fireside seating if available. The hostess greeted us with a happy anniversary and we got seated by the fireplace!",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
I and my wife go there to celebrate our first year anniversary. We love the restaurant and everything along with it. People there are very friendly and professional. We had a great time and be sure that we will recommendate this wonderful place to our friends.  Thanks again,5,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
"We'e heard good things about the restaurant for a long time. The atmosphere and ambiance were nice. It was a Wednesday night so the restaurant wasn't crowded. The food was good, but not outstanding. The service, for a $100 dinner night out, was below average. About the same as the expereince at a run of the mill neighborhood restaurant. Our decision, for the money spent we'll choose other restaurants in the area for half the price and twice the experience.",3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Great place to eat. Amazing food and service.,3,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
WONDERFUL food! We went for my boyfriend's birthday and tried a little bit of everything! The service was great and everything went perfectly! I would definitely recommend this place... and the canolis were OUTSTANDING!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Appetizers fabulous I had fresh mozzarella with prosciutto. Main course ok chicken mascarpone. Dessert good Italian cream cake. Service excellent.,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
We had the Caramelle di Pasta and it was phenomenal!!!!!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
All around an outstanding quiet and romantic with amazing food! Will return because we would really like to try more of the menue!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Food is ALWAYS spectacular, and a personal wine pairing is an absolute must!  This is a GREAT family run, fine dining experience where service is always top notch.  On this particular visit, we met the entire Noto family, and had a very pleasant tour of the entire facility, given by Mama Noto's beautiful grand-daughter.  What a fitting romantic evening for my fiance' and I! We hope to have a reception at Noto's in the very near future.  Noto's Old World Italian proved once again why it is our very favorite restaurant in West Michigan.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Should have done more homework ahead of time Was our belated Christmas family get-together. Two small children. Definitely not kid-friendly. Evil stares from waiter and neighboring table. No music or white noise so any sound by kids was amplified. Waiter made it clear we weren't his favorite table. Service was horrible. Had to seek out bartender to pay check Hostess totally ignored us for first 10 minutes even though no one else was waiting. Food was nice too look at and was very good.,2,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"Some of the worst service I have ever received. The food was extremely overpriced for the portions received. There was live music being played in what is supposed to be a very nice Italian restaurant, yet 1970's rock was being played. One would expect Italian or classical music. This was a major disappointment.",2,BarryS,Indiana
We make it a custom to celebrate our anniversary there every year. Been doing it since they opened.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
I brought our Customer to Noto's for dinner. They all raved about the variety of wine's available and really enjoyed the surroundings and food selections. Everyone had great food and a good time. The service was wonderful as well and we will be back again.  We are never disappointed!,5,Jojo,Grand Rapids
Awesome food and the staff are very attentive and professional.,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"After reading the reviews online I was a bit nervous we were in for a bad experience. I was pleasantly suprised on the friendiness &amp; attentiveness from the hostess, to the wait staff to the owner who came over to our table for a chat. The dissapointment however came from the food itself. It wasn't ""bad"", but it was just ""ok"" - I would expect more from such a nice place. The flavors were mediocre, nothing that I said ""WOW"" that tasted amazing. It's as if the restaurant itself is just an after thought to what they really desire to be &amp; that is a banquet facility. The wine pour was pathetic for the price. Sadly, for the price, I will choose to spend that money elsewhere in town.",3,Mimi,Detroit
Absolutely overpriced; food is boring. Wish you have more extensive menu.,2,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Not much to say... First experience with Opentable and LOVED it. Looking into Opentable as an option in our restaurants.  Notos was a very pleasant surprise. The food was outstanding and the service was extraordinary. Everybody that came in contact with us was very genuine and grateful we were dining there. Will certainly keep in mind for future date nights! Many thanks!!!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"We enjoyed our meal and discovered they have a live band on Wednesday nights. Our food was excellent, but it was pricy. It would be a special occasion place for us, we couldn't afford going there weekly or monthly.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"This was the first time we had been to Noto's. It was for our 10 year anniversary. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to go have a wonderful dining experience for a special occasion. We were not rushed at all which was great. If you are in a hurry then go somewhere else. Noto's is about quality food and the experience, not feed them and get them out the door. We were given a tour of the wine cellar after dinner. It was also wonderful. Next time we go (and we will) we are going to hit the cellar. Noto's is a bit pricey but worth every penny. Wine selection is outstanding. You need to try Noto's.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Food and service were both amazing. Will definitely be returning.,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"This was the first time going there for us, and we really liked it. Everything was wonderful. Definitely for a special occasion, as the prices were a bit higher than we are used to, but that is what we went there for. We will certainly be going back.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Service was great and food was wonderful. Would recommend highly.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"The food was delicious and the service was excellent.The paid guitar-playing singers juxtaposed with elevator music, however, killed the ambiance.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"We really want to like this restaurant as it is close to home but every time we dine here it is just mediocre to poor. The building is beautiful, especially the basement area, and they have a very extensive selection of Italian wines. When you have hundreds of Italian wines it would help to have wait staff that are able to make recommendations but sadly, they can't. The last time we dined here service was VERY slow and food was over salted (even my Ceasar salad was covered in salt).",2,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Food was warm - not hot as in temperature. Service was unbelievably sloooooooow. Waited thirty minutes plus to get the check. Wait staff passed by no less than four times and finally saw the credit card in my waiving hand.,2,Tomjr,Austin
Easy to make reservations. Our reservations were for 5:00. We were the first ones in restaurant. It was very cold. Someone had given us a Groupon for Notos. Service was very good. The young man knew the food options well even though he said he had worked there only 2 weeks. He answered all of our questions. The food was OK. My husband had the chicken with alfredo sauce. I had the lamb with vegetables. The portion size was excellent. We would probably not make an extra effort to visit Notos again.,3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Nice restarant with good food. Service is quite attentive. Although they have an extensive wine menu, the waiter did not seem very knowledgeable (and did offer to get help). They have a nice jazz band on Wed - Sat in the lounge, but you can hear the music from the next room (probably at a better level). There were lots of couples and small tables, although it looks like they have the ability to serve larger parties. I would suggest you wait until your appetizer arrives to order food...unless you want them served close together. Very enjoyable evening!!",4,Deborah,Orange County
"Food was good, not exceptional. Service excellent. Expensive. Great ambiance.",3,WeLuvFood1,Detroit
Food is overpriced; salad for $10 which is Olive Garden quality! Eggplant was greasy and tough. Waiter was slow as it took almost 20 minutes for him to bring wine. Only bright spot was the warm greeting by the hostess. She is a real gem,3,Member,Minneapolis
"We went to Noto's because we had purchased a Groupon deal. We were pleasantly surprised, and plan to go back often with friends and family.",5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Fantastic choice for many events. There are tables that are family friendly but I have have also had more intimate dining experiences in this restaurant. Just ask for a more private table. The cellar is amazing--meaning both the wine list and the barrel vaulted dining cellar.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
A great restaurant and dining experience. It's our favorite.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"My food was not the best. It was overcooked and quite tasteless. I ordered the eggplant dish and seriously if I had not seen it on the menu, I wouldn't have known it was eggplant. I've eat there before, so I know they have good food.",3,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Great service and excellent meals,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"This is a hidden gem in Grand Rapids. Easy to find, good parking, excellent food and a wine list to die for. The owner even visited our table and offered us a tour of the wine cellar and private dining rooms. Great hospitality that you don't often see in todays restuarants. All in all it was a wonderful experience. We are going back again next year when we visit Grand Rapids during Art Prize.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Excellent food and fantastic service! Very impressive to see the owner personally thank each guest as they leave and invite to future events.,5,OpenTable Diner,Charleston
The mussels were fabulous. Just needs to come with more bread so you can get all the yummy sauce.,5,ShareGreatFood,E. Tennessee
Excellent food and a fine environment. The wine selection was enormous and their suggestion was exactly what we were looking for. The noise is medium but you still feel as if you were the only ones there because of the nice set up and attention given by the waiters and waitresses.,4,OpenTable Diner,Philadelphia
"I made reservations on a weekday because it was my wife's birthday - asked for their ""Best Table"" for seven people. We were seated at a standard round table in the middle of the main room - nothing special at all. Despite mostly open tables due to it being a weekday, it took forever to get salads/bread then our dinners. I understand and respect that homemade food takes a while - but the service was extremely slow. The food was good - just slow - and small portions.",3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Very good food, great ambiance and service.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"We love Noto's and the Noto family. If you haven't eaten there, you need to put them on your list!",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Our experience was memorable. We truley enjoyed the food and abiance. Thank you,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
First time at restaurant and were very happy with everything.  We got a cute booth next to window and food was amazing. The lobster and crab ravioli was amazing! Will definitely go there again when we are in Grand Rapids!,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
The server was excellent.  Very attentive and offered to replace our food.  We both ordered pizza.  It was undercooked and contained red pepper flakes which were not listed on the menu and I can not eat.  We were originally placed by the kitchen when other tables were available.  We asked and were moved.  We could not even converse without yelling due to the notice level.  Definitely not the special night we had planned on.,1,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Our food and the service were very good!!  Not sure about booking with ""Open Table"", we were seated in the back nearest the kitchen when there were many other tables available.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"I have been to Bistro many times.  The food, service and food wait time is exceptional.  I usually go for the specials as they are inventive and delicious.  However, the last time I was there I went for the fabulous beef bourguignon.  I ordered with potato gnocchi, instead of the traditional potatoes.  amazing.",5,jonesy,Grand Rapids
"The food and service were excellent!  But if you have any hearing loss, it may not be a good choice for conversation while you dine.  It was our first time there, looking forward to our next visit!",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
It was Girls Mystery Weekend Extravaganza and Bistro Bella Vita was our dinner restaurant.  I requested a nice table location being that us moms do not get time out without the kids or hubbies very often.  We were placed at a wonderful booth location with a very nice server.  I ordered the Filet Mignon and it was delicious!  The salad was delicious and so were the desserts.  We were very pleased.  I hope to take my family back next time we are in Grand Rapids!,5,Mommy19,Grand Rapids
We had dinner on a busy Friday night.  The service was exceptional and the food was outstanding.,5,AmyD,Grand Rapids
"Food was Ok, but for the price a disappointment.  The resturant was a bit too loud, but it was a Friday so understandable.  The waiter was outstanding and the cocktail menu was good.",3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Everything was perfect from the moment we arrived until we left.  I used the online reservation and stated we were celebrating our anniversary.   Our waitress wished us a happy anniversary.  Great job transfering the information from online to the staff.,5,bigeater,Grand Rapids
"I made a reservation in the morning and was seated immediately in the evening on November 28th. It was not busy at 8:30 on a Tuesday night, but it was my first time there, so I had made the reservation. The Wild Mushroom Polenta (I highly recommend it, but it is not a ""light snack"") was a delicious appetizer and was prepared quickly. For entrées, my girlfriend and I ordered the Four Cheese Ravioli and the Atlantic Salmon. Both were superb; well portioned and prepared quickly. The waitress was helpful, but very quiet. She was always there when you needed her, and occasionally when you didn't, just to make sure. The reason I gave four stars was because the interior was boring (an excessive amount of natural wood and brown paint).",4,csmith47754,Grand Rapids
We brought a guest and he could not stop raving about the food and I'm sure when he is in from Chicago he will be back.,5,PattiS,Grand Rapids
"I came here with my wife. Before we entered the building, we noticed the hostess looked bored and disinterested. Upon entering, the hostess greeted us and showed us to our table. The restaurant was about 1/2 full during our 8pm visit. The view in the restaurant was nice and we ordered the bread appetizer. The app did not meet expectations and we then ordered our entrees. I had the rotisserie chicken and my wife had the Boeuf Bourguignonne. Neither dish were particularly impressive....just ok. The service was decent and we declined the dessert.",3,DineNDash,Columbus
"Our meals were great.  Dinner for the 4 of us included the Crab Tortellini, Chicken Milanese, Lamb, and Roasted Chicken.  All were excellent.  We frequent the Bistro often and they keep the menu fresh and good.",4,AbirthdayNightOut,Grand Rapids
"Bistro Belle Vita is my favorite place in Grand Rapids.  The food is incredible, and the atmosphere is perfect........  Casual dining with top notch food, perfect!!",5,dw70,Grand Rapids
"Everything we tried was wonderful!  Server was friendly, helpful with menu and prompt.  I had the Rotini Con Pollo.  Excellent!  My son had the Filet Mignon, husband had Boeuf Bourguignonne.  We tasted each others dishes and voted the Rotini Con Pollo our favorite.  Ended the evening with a perfect Creme Brulee.  Valet parking was helpful since we did not know the area.",5,busybee,Chicago
We were seated immediately when we arrived.   Service was above average and the food was outstanding.  We would recommend the Bella Vita to anyone visiting Grand Rapids,5,yooperbychoice,Milwaukee
"This place has it all from a cool atmosphere, fantastic menu, bar and awesome servers! We live on the other side of the state and this is a regular stop when in town!",5,Irishfoodie,Detroit
"Another great evening here - excellent martinis &amp; food.  Having an Open Table reservation saved the day again - thousands of people downtown Grand Rapids for ArtPrize Festival.  Great selection of gins and vodkas for martinis, also interesting stuffed olives.",5,David5,Grand Rapids
"Had wonderful service, food, and cocktails on busy Friday and Saturday nights.",5,Lori,Grand Rapids
Bread course was yummy but my pasta meal was too salty. Noisy.,3,A2JM,Detroit
"Very good food, and a very friendly waitress.  Since this was our first time at this restaurant, she was very helpful, helping us make our dinner selections.",5,Dining2Nite,Detroit
My wife and I had a great evening with great food and really terrific service. The waiter was outstanding. We had a really beautiful evening out alone.,5,denfood,Detroit
"It's one thing to pay for a salad to go with your entree, but to pay a dollar for a roll or piece of bread?  Come on.  If it's going to be a problem, jut add a dollar to the price of the entree.",4,susan,Grand Rapids
"Good food, good service, nice atmosphere. Seated right at reservation time.",4,krazydazy,Detroit
"My wife and I were here to celebrate our wedding anniversary, but it wasn't announced prior to our arrival. Our server, Amy, asked if we were celebrating anything, and when she found out about our occasion, she treated us to a free dessert. Class all the way. We love this place and make it a go-to whenever in Grand Rapids. Beef Burgandy is excellent.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
I've eaten here a couple of times now and each time the food is absolutely delicious! I can't remember what I ordered but the gin and tonic was mixed perfectly. I would definitely go here again but only for special occasions as they are a bit pricey to eat here a lot.,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Celebrated a 50th birthday with 5 of us. Great time, great food and service- was hard to hear at times - yeah maybe that's part of the turning 50!",3,Celebrating,Detroit
It's always an enjoyable experience dining at Bistro Bella Vita.  they always have a unique and exciting menu of chef's specials and classic standards.  Very enjoyable.  Always my go to spot in Grand Rapids when I visit.,5,dcdetzel,Detroit
My family and I recently celebrated my mother's birthday here. It was an excellent choice that satisfied both the foodies and the pizza lovers in our group. Service was fantastic. The duck ravioli is highly recommended!,5,mej3,Detroit
Amazing food once again! I recommend this place to anyone wishing to eat 5 star quality and service!,5,Gh0stprototype,Grand Rapids
"The selection was great, the food was delicious, but it wasn't quite what I expected.  Hubby and I ate here for our 5th Anniversary.  It wasn't busy even with ArtPrize, but it still had a crowded feeling due to the table layout.  A waitress for another table bumped into ours FIVE times.  It took some of the shine off the evening.  After our meal, we got pour-over coffees and dessert.  The coffee was overfilled, and it poured all over the table.  I guess they were literal when they named it a pour-over.  I did my best to soak it up, but the waitress didn't even offer to help.  They billed the coffees/dessert separately, so we were overcharged a dollar.  At that point, we were eager to leave, so we didn't quibble over the extra dollar.",3,Rinny,Grand Rapids
Great food. Nice service. Off restaurant row. Nice walk from downtown. Great for Artprize,4,Mcmamacoco,Grand Rapids
We had an excellent martini and pairing with a flatbread pizza.  Great location and great food.,5,2olives,Grand Rapids
"This was a perfect restaurant for a wonderful meal after touring Art Prize all day.  We were able to obtain a reservation about a week prior to our visit and the restaurant also is showing several Art Prize entries.  Although the specials on the menu looked interesting, we ordered off the regular dinner menu.  The goat cheese appetizer was perfect served with bread, arugula and diced tomatoes.  Our group of 3 split the Rotini con Pollo and the Rigatoni Bolognese which were split for us prior to serving in small bowls on a plate.  Both dishes were very good.  The warm chocolate cake was exceptional as a top off for this meal.  The server was friendly, helpful and attentive.  The decor and atmosphere of the restaurant was also fun.",5,AnnArbor,Philadelphia
Like it so much we went there two nights in a row! That says it all.,5,Laur,Detroit
"I always get great food at Bistro Bella Vita, the service can be a little hit or miss. But the food is always spectacular and their martinis are great!  Lunch is spectacular,  never over crowded, but obviously a well used spot in Grand Rapids!",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Bistro is a wonderful place for a romantic evening or casual dinner. The service was and always has been nothing short of perfect and the food excellent.,5,Dinner4two,Detroit
This is our second time at Bella Vita and once again we were not disappointed. My wife and I shared the stuffed Medjool dates-excellent flavor and a great way to start the evening. My Wife had the gnocchi with the duck sausage and and shrimp-very well prepared- and I enjoyed the Cassoulet which was loaded with flavor. The service was quick and friendly. A very enjoyable evening.,5,affamee,Grand Rapids
Begin with a Plum Crazy Martini and end with Warm Chocolate Cake and all the rest will be great!,5,CanadianLakers,Grand Rapids
"I have eaten almost every where in Grand Rapids I would definitely say I'm eclectic in my taste I love everything from pho to Tom kha Kai paneer and many other things so when it comes to pleasing me I want something new that I've never had or a whole new twist on an ordinary dish, bistro Bella vita did that and more the flavors were perfect the food was hot the ambiance was ideal. This is the restaurant I will pick when I want my friends from out of state to remember Grand Rapids.Definitely a must try!",5,Ashmarie,Grand Rapids

Great restaurant.  Excellent preparation and fresh ingredients.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Went out with a group of friends.  Food was very good.  Service was a bit slow but I don't think it was our server's fault.  The restaurant was busy and we don't think there was enough staff.  Both our server and his assistant were very pleasant, polite, and friendly.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids

"Bravo is a wonderful restaurant in the Portage, MI area. We dine there consistently for everything from stopping by at the last minute for a beer and pasta to all special occasion dining. The wine list is excellent;craft beers are available; pizza choices are fun &amp; yummy; and, of course, all other dining always well prepared.",5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
You could offer a few more vegetables and a better cheese selection. The beef dish didn't look very appetizing.  Your price of $20 for an adult Sunday brunch is pretty steep. A senior option would be nice! Service is excellent!,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Good food and great service. Food was brought very promptly.,5,EmilyM,Grand Rapids
Bravo has become a habit when we visit in Kalamazoo and get together with friends. It's a reliable place for high quality food and service in a setting where we can converse and enjoy each other. We look forward to our next visit.,5,KazooGuy,Orlando

"Absolutely amazing staff, food, and overall experience provided. They made our group of adults with disabilities feel very welcome. Erik was an incredible waiter, attentive to our group needs, and even made a special dessert for someone's bday that has dietary restrictions. Our water glasses were even continuously refilled! Our group was very happy and satisfied. Thank you to the entire staff there.",5,AG1020,Chicago
"Sadly, this restaurant is going downhill.  The ill qualified hostesses give a dreadful first impression to the restaurant.  The servers have been good however this time there weren't enough and our service was painful.   We could not have coffee or dessert as it took over a half hour between the time the menus were dropped off and the server was able to return to take the order.  The food choices are inundated  with sauces that do not necessarily do the food justice.",3,StephanieW,Chicago
"Reliable. Excellent. Posh environment, exquisite cuisine, and value oriented all at once. You know you'll have a great time here. We had ages ranging from 7 to 87. Everyone in our party was very pleased.",5,Javabeanme,Grand Rapids

No better chef in Kalamazoo and no better mushroom soup ANYWHERE.,5,PaulJ,Grand Rapids
great food and service- a nice evening with out of town friends.,4,Gerard,Chicago
"Not Bravo! the Chain but the original. I thought this waste chain restaurant and first impression upon entry affirmed that. But the menu was different and WAY better. We had mushroom soup (I left with the recipe), cesar topped with duck breast, Cobb salad and a fabulous white chocolate mousse.   Everything was excellent.    The story from the great waitress was that the chain literally copied this restaurant right down to the Untrademarked name.",5,WellFed,Cincinnati
we had a wonderful dinner and the servers were friendly and checked on us regularly even though we were the only ones left on the outdoor patio.,5,BethanyV,Grand Rapids

We experienced both a delightful dining experience as well as great service!,5,lyriclynn,Grand Rapids
Great meal as always.  Service was stellar too.  Love the gluten free options and the fact that the server remembered my restrictions throughout the meal.  Really enjoy having a classy place available where you can have a good conversation without having to shout at your companion across the table.,5,LaurieR,Grand Rapids
"We chose Bravo for a group brunch with family to celebrate my mothers 60th birthday. The host staff was pleasant and friendly both confirming our reservation and as we arrived. The service was good, although with a large group that had gifts on the table, there was no acknowledgement of a special occasion. We did mention several times that it was a birthday. I even had to light my moms birthday candle from the sterno flame under the chafer, because the server did not offer a lighter.  A simple ""Happy Birthday"" from the server, or door staff would have been a nice gesture.  Our group did enjoy the variety of the brunch buffet. Everyone was happy with their selections. Omelets made to order were great. However, we were not offered juice, mimosa or coffee. We had to ask for them. As I was hosting, it was frustrating because my guests did not understand they were included.  Overall, it was a good experience, and we will probably return when visiting family in Kalamazoo.",4,IvyC,Grand Rapids
Good food and service.  Worth the trip A little pricy but willing to pay for a good meal,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago

We always have excellent service and food at Bravo. They accommodate our special requests for a booth whenever possible.

It is one our favorite restaurants!,4,Foodie,Grand Rapids
Fabulous Sunday brunch buffet! Will return if we are in the area again!,4,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"Went for a special occasion. The meal was very bland in flavor, nothinbg special. I expected a real dinning experience, but could have done better in my own kitchen.

It might be unfair to review. We arrived at closing time.,2,OpenTable Diner,Toronto
Incredible food and service. World class!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"I wouldn't go back to this restaraunt.. the setting was good, dimly lit and a nice atmosphere. However, the food. Was not close to being impressive, especially for the price! My dish looked like they just threw it together and I'm pretty sure that my 12 year old sister could cook more professionally. My girlfriends plate was good, but her chicken was dry and not very good. Overall, it was poor food, over priced and very decieving and I wouldn't reccomend it. Maybe it was just a bad night because all the reviews I read were good.. oh and don't let me forget.. we had to raise our voices just se we could hear each other.",3,OpenTable Diner,New England
"We flew into Kalamazoo airport and walked across to Bravo. Nice atmosphere, the food was OK but nothing exceptional. My stuffed pork chops were overcooked and WAY too salty. Service was well above average. Wife had the pasta sampler, lasagna was sub-standard, stuffed pasta shells were very good, tortellini about average. Seemed a little pricey for the quality of food presented. Can't have alcohol when flying so we did not examine the wine list.",3,OpenTable Diner,Detroit

"Our memory of dining at Bravo! several years ago was not tanished by a recent visit. Atmosphere was cozy and inviting and service attentive. Meals with fish, chicken, and pizza were well prepared and seasoned nicely. The only flaw was a very small portion of stuffed chicken breast given the price of the entree.",4,Foodfrog,Chicago

Everything from breakfast selections including fantastic custom made omelets, waffles with fruit topping, variety of rolls etc.  Everything else, in addition to breakfast,  included beef, fish, pork and chicken.  Our waitress was very attentive and pleasant.  And the desserts were yummy.  Price is great. Can’t wait to go again.",5,BevB,Grand Rapids

"Bravo's Sunday brunch is still one of the best around. They've held the line on pricing for years now, and the value is still substantial. They've made some changes recently which aren't the greatest--muffins and the like replaced with some kind of pull-apart monkey bread analog, and the fruit is no longer individual slices but rather one big bowl of chunks--but the value is still more than sound for what you'll pay. The restaurant itself is beautiful, with a constantly-burning fireplace as the room's centerpiece. Your view of it, of course, may vary.  A recent change featured cucumber slices in the water, which turns out to be a lot tastier than you may expect and turns even city water into an experience. I tend to prefer lime in the water, but cucumber worked quite well.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"The food is excellent, especially the mushroom soup. Creamy with loads of mushrooms. Service, and more specifically bartender Angie was fantastic.",5,rg77,Chicago
As it has been for 30 years a prime example of a Genuine local gift,4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Loved that we could make reservations through Open Table for a large group on relatively short notice.  Excellent food- everyone ate something different and everyone satisfied at the end of the meal.  Couldn't resist sharing several of the desserts- again delicious!  Definitely worth driving across town to get there.,5,Hangry,Grand Rapids
"Food was awesome, just the right portion size,  service was excellent",5,KathyG,E. Tennessee
Had Sunday brunch. Nothing stood out as a must have again. Not a huge selection by any means.  I guess I was expecting more for the $.,4,John,Detroit
Bravo’s brunch is always the best.  It’s a great place to relax and have great conversation.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"The cost of the food was not as good as it should have been for the price, it was only mediocre.  Our water glasses were constantly being refilled, so much that we felt we were drowning. Unfortunately, our waitress was not as attentive.  She was not available to wait on us when we needed anything, refill on coffee, dessert menu, etc. One of our party asked for the dessert menu when we first sat down but we never did get it until we asked TWO more times at the end of our meal! And it was not because the place was busy, there were only two or three other tables occupied. Will probably never go back unless I am forced.",2,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
It’s a real treat to go to their Sunday Brunch. We also have Thanksgiving reservations for the first time this year &amp; looking forward to the meal.,5,BrianM,Detroit
"Awesome food, best brunch, wood fire oven. Prices are right.",5,AGPG,Adelaide / SA
Great FOOD again and again,5,SanDiego2011,Denver
We had a great dinner prior to seeing a show at Miller auditorium. They were very accommodating with altering entrees to meet our vegetarian requests. We were very pleased.,5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Their whitefish and wild mushroom risotto are both outstanding.,5,JeJo,Grand Rapids
"My wife and I went there for our Anniversary. We are from out of town and picked this restaurant from previous reviews. This is by far the best food we have eaten. I had the Surf and Turf, The steak melted in my mouth along with the great flavor from the Lobster tail. My wife had the special Mac and Cheese. She stated this was the best she had ever had bar none. Just the correct amount of cheese and flavor.  Would highly recommend going to tis restaurant. I know we will next time we are in the area.",5,OpenTable Diner,Toledo
"BRAVO? Never disappoints. Everything is top notch. Great atmosphere, staff and  food!",5,J9Kzoo,Grand Rapids
I was disappointed with the quality of the food. It was okay but not memorable. It was typical buffet fare. I have dined at Bravo on numerous occasions and the food and experience has always been outstanding. This was my first time for their brunch service and I was expecting more.,3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Always a great experience at Bravo for their Sunday brunch. And to make the day more perfect, we had the assistance of Patrick to take care of us. Thanks to all at Bravo. You are why we are repeat diners!",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Brunch was wonderful.  A good variety of food and it all tasted great!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"We brought in some New friends of ours. Their first time to the restaurant. We absolutely love Bravo’s and talked them up to our friends.  BraVo’s went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable, Lindsay was very Knowledgeable with her Whiskey/Bourbons , our guest didn’t have to wait to “check with the bartender” like some places.  Our dirty martini’s  were spot on! Our guests enjoyed their Lobster Ravioli &amp; Calamari  , and then Salmon and Duck. He said this is his new favorite place for duck. He’s searched everywhere. Chef Cody knocked it out of the park with the Scallop Special! And Chef Joe was kind enough to bring them out and say hi and took excellent care of us! Joe also brought out an amazing ribeye for us! Host/hostess were very friendly !  Natasha was very attentive with clearing plates and make sure our water was filled.  Also took some time to chat to get to know us better. We and our guests LOVE LOVE LOVED EVERYTHING!! We will obviously be back , but our new guests will now be more frequent guests ! :))",5,OpenTable Diner,Jacksonville
"Bravo! provides consistently excellent cuisine in a charming setting.  Highlights are their wood-fired pizzas, their mushroom soup, their in-house brewed craft beers, they're pasta dishes....the list goes on....never had a disappointing meal there.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"I had never been here, but had always heard it was good.  We decided to try it for a birthday celebration. Service was outstanding and the food was delicious.  I had the scallop special with risotto.   The only thing I'd question was the value. Three scallops (and the risotto) for $28?  These were standard size  1 to 1 1/2 inch scallops, not giant ones.  That seems a little on the meager side.  Don't expect monster portions, but again, 3 seemed like not enough for the price when everything else is ala carte.  My husband had lasagna which was also delicious, and better proportioned.   I'd definitely go there again, but would not order that dish the second time around.",4,OpenTable Diner,Orange County
"Our waiter was excellent! Told the restaurant in the reservation notes that we were celebrating our 2-year anniversary, and also requested fireside seating if available. The hostess greeted us with a happy anniversary and we got seated by the fireplace!",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
I and my wife go there to celebrate our first year anniversary. We love the restaurant and everything along with it. People there are very friendly and professional. We had a great time and be sure that we will recommendate this wonderful place to our friends.  Thanks again,5,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
Our server was good until he just didn't exist anymore. We were sitting outside.  Was attacked by bugs. Food was very good. A little pricey,3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"The food as delicious.  Hostess seated us promply. Very calm, peaceful atmosphere.This gem of a restaurant had slipped past our go to list, through no fault of this establishment.  We will definitely put it on our top notch list.We will surely remind our friends of this delightful Restaurant.",5,RonaldS,Detroit
"Food and service is always top notch, dining at Bravo is always a pleasurable experience.",5,DeborahG,Grand Rapids
"Our favorite restaurant in Kalamazoo.  Food NEVER disappoints!  We like the bar area for a bit more of a casual setting - and like to sit outside weather permitting.   Thursday 1/2 price pasta, pizza &amp; pints nights make the price very affordable.  We will be back very soon!",5,WendyV,Washington DC
"Good food and really great service.    The food and drinks were properly prepared and very tasty, and our server was top notch.  Great place!",5,RobH,Grand Rapids
Wonderful.  This was our first visit and we took our out of town guests with us.  We ALL loved it. Great idea having the Thursday special offers.,5,LouiseG,Grand Rapids
Brunch was terrific and our server was friendly and helpful.,4,Jayne,Naples
"Table was ready when we got there. Bravo makes own beer and it was great. Menu interesting, many options and delicious. The potato asparagus soup was seasoned perfectly.",5,KatherineK,Detroit
Consistently offering delicious food specials &amp; fantastic service! I highly recommend Bravo! Restaurant &amp; Cafe.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"This is a great place to go for really for a quiet dinner with excellent Italian food.  The menu isn't particularly long but there are enough choices to keep everyone happy.  Similarly for the wine list, it is modest in length for this kind of restaurant but very well chosen with fair prices.  Food and service were excellent.  Very nice decor and nice casual dress expectations make it a comfortable place to spend an evening.",5,gratefuldiner,Chicago
Dining with friends we look for good food without blaring televisions or loud music. Good food and wine in pleasant surroundings is still to be found here.,4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"My sis turned 74 and right off from the beginning the server we had totally blew what was suppose to be a surprise desert that I had called in the day before, that was just weird. One had lasagna and one had pasta and two had fish with way to much breading on it. Even tho the service is lousy and the server never comes back and forgets what you asked for, we may give it another try when in Kalamazoo. They deserve a second chance we all decided. Limited menu and wine list moderately priced.",3,OpenTable Diner,Miami
For those people that are looking for a step above Olive Garden-Italian cuisine.,4,Kmckinley,Cincinnati
The restaurant it's self is not the bravo chain restaurant but rather a locally owned restaurant in portage. The food was good but came out more on the cool side .  The mushroom soup is one of their well-known dishes and it is fantastic although it also came out not very warm.  The waitstaff was amazing,4,MommaS,Columbus
My husband and I were visiting Kalamazoo for the weekend and were looking for a nice restaurant to try.  We were not disappointed.  The food and wine were excellent.  The service even better.,4,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
Enjoyed Bravo very much.  My first time there for a meal.  Have been in bar area only once before for drink and appetizer.  I highly recommend it and will certainly be back . . . . and will bring friends and family.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"We LOVE wonderful, interesting food served well, so Bravo has been a favorite since it opened! Whether celebrating special family occasions, entertaining out of town guests, or enjoying a quiet lunch, we've never been disappointed. Thanks, Bravo!",5,Foodie,Grand Rapids

The food was very good. We enjoyed our meals and the experience.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
I have been dining at Bravo's for many years.  I am always very pleased with the food and the service.  Menu has a variety of selections.  Their brunches are the best!,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Went there for lunch &amp; it was Great!!😎,5,Suzette,Chicago
"My girlfriend and I both went here for Valentines Day and we absolutely loved it. We both got something off the pasta menu, and I believe that their pastas are fantastic!! They also got us our food a lot quicker than expected.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Our valentine's dinner from the fantastic service to the delicious food was a great night out for my husband and I. Our waitress was pleasant, very knowledgeable about the menu, and happy to give us some direction when asked, and very attentive.  The food was delicious, and we will be returning.",5,OpenTable Diner,Birmingham
"Our server, Angie, gave us full attention but never rushed us.  She comped us a dessert, white chocolate mousse with raspberry sauce (mmmm), because she had a minor problem opening our bottle of wine.  The filet medallions on toast points as an appetizer was the highlight.  The salmon/scallops dish was spicy and perfect.  Duck breast on risotto was fine, but not special.",4,Thewire,Grand Rapids
"Have been here twice for dates and each time find the atmosphere, food, service, and overall dining experience a pleasure! Very nice for a date night or other special occasion!",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"We are veterans at this brunch...having attended many, many times!  The variety of food is excellent and always well prepared.  The staff very attentive, and always willing to make sure every detail is satisfactory.  Love this restaurant, and look forward to coming here for years to come!!!",5,gopokes,Grand Rapids
"Great restaurant; however our prime choice in town would still be Martell's for the value and scenic view. Roughly once a month we visit a restaurant in this cost value and I would say Bravo! holds it's own, but for a little less I feel I get a better experience across town.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"We celebrated Valentine's Day on Saturday and had dinner at Bravo. We loved our dinners, our waitress was knowledgeable and very attentive. WE love Bravo !",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Solid, adult atmosphere created an enjoyable early Valentine's day evening for two without a jumbo price tag. We appreciated the small plate options for those who don't need or want portions for three and which allowed us to have room to enjoy soup and a shared dessert. Our food choices were well prepared, served at correct temperature and delicious.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
My husband and I went out for a quiet dinner to celebrate Valentine's day early.  This was a good choice.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Service was very good along the food being well prepared!!!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Great food, ambience. A little pricey, but the food is always tasty and the servers are pros. Mostly businesspeople at lunch time.  Try the mushroom soup.",5,TryITout,Grand Rapids
"This was our first dining experience at Bravo.  The service was unsurpassed by any restaurant I have dined at.  Waiters were all excellent, expedient, very helpful and very professional.  Food and Cocktails were very good.  Would highly recommend your restaurant.",5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Duck and mushroom risotto was phenomenal!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
A perfect evening ~ arrived and the table location was very acceptable for seven. Our server was very attentive and managed our care nicely. The meal was excellent and we appreciated the opportunity to converse and enjoy our food and company at a leisurely pace. We'll definitely return!,4,ClaudiaB,Grand Rapids
"Many times I've driven by Bravo! but had never eaten there.  I needed a place to go with friends before seeing a play and thought it might be a good time to try it. I was impressed with every part of it; the ambiance, the food, the service, and the wine list. Even the name was apropos for the evening!",5,sadiesweetie,Washington DC
Unique Italian fare. Classy atmosphere. Old world. Servers were attentive but not overbearing. Food was cooked appropriately.,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"have had sunday brunch 25 times or more o ver many years,quality remains high  &amp; consistant.chicken bravo w/o noodles is not the same.",5,Pjager64,Grand Rapids
"This is our go to place for special events like birthdays or a special date night. The food is always very good and we always have fantastic service. Prices are mid to slightly high, but the quality is well worth it! My teenagers love this place too, good for families as well as a romantic dinner. Love Bravo, they treat you like family.",5,Ddinner1,Grand Rapids
"We had a great night.  Our Server Allison was fabulous!! The food was good and the setting was warm and comfortable and upscale. Just what my daughter was looking for, for her 20th Birthday celebration!",4,KC2016,Grand Rapids
The food was tasty. Seasoned nicely and presented well.,5,Mom8283,Grand Rapids
We enjoy exploring restaurants as we travel but  love coming back to Bravo.,5,Foodie,Grand Rapids
A few of us were early for a lunch gathering and the waiter arranged a dinner appetizer we could share.  There is always a willingness to meet our needs.  It is consistently my favorite restaurant.,5,Pamela,Grand Rapids
"Glad we made a reservation to celebrate our anniversary as the restaurant was very busy.  Maybe a little too busy.  That's why we made the reservation for Monday night.  Food was great, but the service was a little slow with the place so busy.  We do very much appreciate our waiter coming to us and telling us that he accidentally charged the wrong table on our card.  The store manager followed up with us later about the charge and the charge was never finalized.",4,Anniversary,Grand Rapids
"This was my fourth time eating at Bravo and I have always had good meals.  I saw duck on the menu and thought it would be a good choice.  It was not.  I ordered it medium (not medium rare as recommended) but it can medium rare, almost rare.  It was tough, really tough.  I noted this and the waiter offered to cook it more but last time I tried that with a steak it came back well done and everything else was cold, so I passed.  My friends ravioli was so -so.  Maybe it was an off night but given the cost of the duck it was an expensive off night.",3,Calgourmet,San Francisco
Bravo! was an excellent choice and the food was delicious. The scallop special was fantastic! The flavors and presentation was second to none. Our server was excellent and the supporting staff kept the water glasses full and bread on the table at all times. Thank you for a wonderful evening with my family.,5,MARK3,Las Vegas
Loved it! The cheesecake alone was worth a revisit. Our waitress was very sweet and the food came quickly. You will definitely being seeing us again.,5,Luke,Grand Rapids
I have always been very happy with Bravo but this time was different. Very cramped booth in the bar area which was not comfortable. This was a business dinner. In retrospect I wished I'd requested a table (not initially offered during seating) in the dining area. There was a crying baby directly behind us that made conversation challenging. The wait person disappeared for long periods.   The location and parking are very convenient to the airport which is a big plus. The experience this time was not so good. I will think twice before I book another business dinner at Bravo.,3,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"When first walking in, the décor/atmosphere was not that inviting and there was no music of any kind.  Dining room was full so we set in the very small bar area.  We wanted a booth and were accommodated. Right by a table of people that were obviously having a work/dinner.  We heard every conversation including vacations, food they ate, etc. Waiter was condescending which  was not enjoyable.   Dinner was served quickly which was a good thing because we did not want to spend the rest of our anniversary there. No recommendation here.",3,Bill,Grand Rapids
"We were traveling and staying at a nearby hotel, so this dinner turned into a really delicious surprise at the end of a tiring drive. Calamari was easily some of the best I have ever eaten. Note to Bravo! PR: get your name on the restaurant list at the Hampton Inn, which is walking distance from your establishment.",5,Clair,Detroit
"Nice place, the surroundings are very nice. The noise level was load enough you could have a good time but not so loud that it would bother anyone trying to have a quiet evening.",4,1sttimer,Grand Rapids
"Our server was very attentive and prompt, food came out quickly. I ordered the mushroom soup to start with and it was wonderful. Everyone was satisfied with our choices and we had a great time",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
Had a wonderful visit. It was busy but service excellent as was the meal. I had Whitefish pan seared with capers and sun dried tomatoes. Perfect The dessert special was to die for!! Baked apple in a pastry with cinnamon and scoop of pumpkin ice cream in middle. Then drizzled Carmel sauce over it. Most Excellent!!,5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"Bravo is the best in town.  They offer an outstanding dining experience from your warm friendly greeting when you walk through the door, great wait staff, perfectly prepaid food through the moment you leave feeling happy with your decision to dine at Bravo.",5,wcastleberry,Grand Rapids
"Nice local spot.  We took clients there and the service and food was excellent.   They offer a wide variety to choose from, which makes it easy for a group of people.  Would revisit them again, on future trips to the area.",4,Bobbiek,Chicago
Long standing tradition to go to Bravo for Sunday Brunch. Great Experience but resturanta could use a little freshening up.,4,OpenTable Diner,Las Vegas
"Dinner was great!  It's the combination of great food, great service and great friends that makes Bravo one of my favorites!  One of the real pluses is the variety of food options.",5,Foodie,Grand Rapids
This was our first visit to Bravo and we chose the Sunday Brunch. It was wonderful in so many ways. The food was fabulous with a large variety of items to choose from. The service was excellent also and we felt it was a great deal for the price. We will definitely be returning and hopefully soon.,5,Maggie,Grand Rapids
We visit frequently and order the pizza's which we believe are incredible.,5,rvbdds,Grand Rapids
We appreciated the quality of food &amp; staff were professional.  Seemed a little pricey so be prepared to spend on the high end of range given.  We were celebrating a special event and it would've been really nice if staff asked especially since we were a good size group w/several generations.  Just a suggestion.,4,Foodie2B,Grand Rapids
We love Bravo for its great food and atmosphere however we were disappointed to be rushed through our dinner.  The food came out way too fast and we were disappointed to have our special evening cut short.,4,StephanieW,Chicago
"We have dined at Bravo! for many years.  While the food is always great, the service can be hit or miss.  The problem comes with a large number of ""walk-ins"" that place a stress on the waitstaff serving those with reservations.  This time we waited 15 minutes before being able to order.  Once it was worse: 30 minutes!  Both times the manager on duty seemed oblivious to the challenges for his waitstaff.  It seems to us he should be prepared to help and provide a more pleasing experience for diners.",4,ExperiencedDiner,Grand Rapids
"The restaurant is Beautiful and the Ambiance is really nice.  The fireplace was Beautiful as it was a damp cool evening last week when we were there.  The food was delicious, although they overcooked my steak and had to redo it.  They brought another one out in about 7 or 8 minutes, so I didn't have to wait.  The service was Great and wine list was decent.",4,PhillipC,Cincinnati
"First review I've written. I live on the Florida gulf coast and am a bit of a seafood snob. I had the seared yellowfin tuna. I can't believe I had this piece of fish in Kalamazoo, mi. Hats off to the buyer and chef.",5,DeeCee,Tampa
"Great experience, had a wonderful time!",5,Michael,Denver
"An enjoyable meal. Well-prepared food, and very attentive service throughout. Very efficient operation, even as they were busy.",4,OldiesButFoodies,Milwaukee
"The waitstaff were great! They helped me decide what I wanted with some great descriptions, and were very attentive and friendly. I went here before my senior prom, and it was very memorable! It had exactly the kind of romantic ambiance we were looking for, and I would definitely recommend it for special occasions. The pasta was awesome!",4,Perfect,Grand Rapids
"Décor and table settings are upscale, service is friendly and prompt, and food is excellent.",5,jabkazoo,Grand Rapids
All the food on the buffet was fresh delicious.  Service was great.,5,Buddha,New Mexico
"Great food!  However, if you have a larger appetite, you might leave hungry.  A bit dishearting to still be hungry after an entrée that cost $30 + dollars.  Service was great.",3,datenight,Grand Rapids
We had friends in town and we had to take them to Bravo! and Bravo! did not disappoint. The food tasted great and was enough to fill us up. It was one of the best meals we had in quite a while. Our friends enjoyed going there and helped make their trip out here a huge success and did well to show the area off for what it has to offer. Thanks Bravo!,5,MartyJ,Grand Rapids
Both my wife and I had outstanding meals. I had the tuna with pesto that was prepared perfectly to my specifications-very rare. My wife's scallops and salmon were literally melt in your mouth.  The entree and the risottos they were served on were so flavorful. These were on the regular menu which was a bonus as we will be back soon.  Our waitress was so friendly-very knowledgable about the wines and beers on the menu.,5,Coady,Grand Rapids
Our favorite restaurant in the area.,5,OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 14, 2015"
"I was in Kalamazoo on business with two others.  The restaurant was recommended to us by a local.  It was so good that we went back the next night, also.  Of the dishes we had, they were all great.  Over the two visits we had the salmon, duck, pasta sampler and the whitefish.  The food was great, and Angie, our server was even better.  It was so good the first night we had Angie make us a reservation for the next night, making sure we were in her area.  She was a great server.  If I return to Kalamazoo, I will definitely go back and try to get Angie as a server.  Their local beer was also good.  Try the stout.",5,David,Boise
"We have enjoyed lunch and dinner at Bravos, and it is always great.  We just went to the Sunday Brunch for the second time, and it is one of the best brunches we have ever had.  It is a diverse selection, the food is spectacular -- and the wait staff is the best.   We look forward to going again and again.",5,Homeagain,Phoenix
"Bravo remains one of my top 3 restaurants in the Kalamazoo/Portage area. When given a choice, I always want to dine at Bravo!",5,Redlily,Grand Rapids
"I love this place! Our  server Paul is really impressive! He made us, three ladies a wonderful afternoon! It snowed heavily on Sunday but we made it to our appointment and we are very happy we made this choice.",5,xixi,Chicago
"I've been to tea here before a few years ago and they must have changed the portion size. I understand high tea has small canapés, but these were tiny! Only enough for one bite. I could have looked past the portion size if the quality was excellent, but this menu selection was just average. For the price, it should be Michelin quality. We opted to add a glass of champagne for $10 extra. When we asked for a second glass of champagne at the end of our service, I expected the glass to be another $10, but when I got the bill it was an extra $44! Talk about a rip off. We could have purchased the whole bottle.",3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Afternoon Tea was simply exquisite. That’s the only way to describe it!,5,ChicagoFoodie,Chicago
"Everything was fantastic. Thomas was a thoughtful and very attentive  server. The champagne was a great way to start. The sandwiches were all delicious; I would love to have another plate of those if I wasn't so full!  I chose the Nutcracker tea and really enjoyed it. The scones are served warm with cream,  jam, and chocolate spreads. I could not finish all of the desserts, so Thomas kindly packaged them to go. The last piece was a biscuit with mint chocolate on top; it was my favorite of the sweets. It is pricey,  but worth it. There were several other restaurants offering tea service in Chicago, but I'm glad I chose the Pavilion.  Thank you for a wonderful afternoon!",5,sherriTaekwondo,New York Area
"The Langham had a wonderful selection of teas, savory bites and sweet options. It is an investment at $78 a person, but it was just wonderful from beginning to end.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Wonderful tea atmosphere and the service is great.  The hotel is beautiful.,5,Tennisfoodie,Chicago
Lovely for a special occasion.   Would request table in main room next time rather than off in corner,4,ANJL,Chicago
The room and hotel were beautiful but the pastries were horrible except for the scones.  The pastries were old and hard like they had been sitting out too long.  Very disappointing...,3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
My daughter and i had holiday tea. It has become a tradition. Absolutely lovely!,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
We were running late they were very accommodating. Service was fantastic.,4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
It is a beautiful setting. Loved the holiday decor! The tea presentation and food were wonderful. I felt that our server was not as attentive to us as he was to other customers around us and it wasn't that crowded. I definitely will come again...the food was that good. In fact we had to take home most of our desserts because we were so satisfied.,4,Shessmarter,Tampa
"The Langham's take on traditional English afternoon tea is comparable to the best hotels in London. Innovative sandwiches, beautiful presentation, impeccable service. The only thing I wasn't keen on was the chocolate scone and chocolate spread. Too unorthodox for my taste buds, otherwise everything was delicious. Shame about some of the other patrons who thought bringing babies is somehow a good thing.",4,Foodie,San Francisco
Wonderful experience for afternoon tea during the Christmas season.  Very leisurely and well spaced out tea.  Food was delicious.  Service was great.  Quite pricey compared to other tea services.,4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Went for the wonderland tea service. Food and tea were delicious. We loved everything we had and there was so much we even had some leftovers to bring home. Appreciate that a glass of sparkling wine was included and the box of chocolates to take home was a nice surprise.,5,April,Chicago
I love high tea. This was a disappointment. The food was mediocre;  only one of the savory items was really good. Pastries were okay. The service was good but definitely wouldn't go again.,3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Brought a friend here for tea for her birthday. The food, service, and ambiance was awesome. I go to tea relatively often, but almost always at The Drake. I'd say the overall experience here was slightly less extravagant than the one at The Drake  (not necessarily in a bad way; just seemed a little more plebeian) but the food was, in my opinion, much better and more unique. Highly highly recommend",5,MB1996,Chicago
"We always love coming here for high tea, their selection is always good and the ambiance is great. Something was a little off with our server this time, for some reason she didn’t feel as accommodating than normal, barely came in to check on us. But otherwise everything was ok.",5,Phil,Chicago
Best high tea in the city! Hands down! The staff was perfectly mannered; the food was divine; the personal touches did not go unnoticed; and everything was absolutely elegant.,5,Fromano85,Chicago
"Best place for high tea!  Beautiful room, delicious food, and superb service.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
We attended the afternoon holiday tea.  They offered a nice selection of sandwich items and desserts.  Their tea selections were broad and interesting.  The layout was elegant and inviting.,5,SilverFox,Chicago
"Just a beautiful tea party with a dear friend. Loved the harpist! She is so talented and lovely. The service was excellent, food inventive and delicious.  The Jasmine tea was heavenly!",5,Nancy,Chicago
"It was our first time at the Langham Hotel. The lobby on the 2nd floor had a gorgeous Christmas tree and beautiful views of the river. The Pavilion was very clean, crisp, and delicately designed. Service was excellent. I asked to be seated by the window and they accommodated that request for the 3 of us moms. Window seats are usually just for 2 people. We had the best server, he described each food and tea accurately, just like a sommelier would for wine. He even offered dark-colored napkins for us since we were all wearing black leggings. I only gave the food 4 stars because my 2 friends didn't really care for the lamb rilette. We also ended up taking home our extra sweets as we were too full. Overall, the food from the savories, scones, sweets,  tea selection , and champagne was really great. I've had tea at The Plaza in NYC, and although the ambience there was more traditional, just like at The Drake, we would definitely go back to The Langham. And btw, valet parking was only $14. The Peninsula charges $23.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
The tea was prepared perfectly without over steeping to prevent bitterness. Foor was so delicious with each savory tea sandwich releasing flavors in layers of a delightful taste profile,5,OpenTable Diner,Las Vegas
"I booked the holiday afternoon tea at The Langham to celebrate 4 birthdays based off reading rave reviews.   Unfortunately, I do have to say I was disappointed for a few reasons — 1. The service was poor. Paul, our server, was very kind, knowledgeable, and did his best but it seemed like it was understaffed or the kitchen was completely behind. We waited for 15 minutes before even being greeted and it was a full hour since we sat down before we received our tea. I think that is unacceptable. 2. The food. Typically a traditional afternoon tea is served on platters where you pick and choose, but this was served individually. Additionally, I didn’t think the ratio of savory vs sweet was proportional as there were much more sweets. The savory course went quickly due to the mini sizes and we had to wait another 20 minutes before the scones and desserts. Lastly, we all ran out of tea before we even started with our scones and desserts and had to request fresh pots.  Paul was sweet with birthday treats and did provide an additional glass of champagne due to the long wait. That was very considerate and we very much appreciate that gesture. Like I mentioned, Paul was great.  I’m glad I tried a new place, but I plan to dine at The Drake and The Peninsula over The Langham moving forward.",2,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Made a reservation for afternoon tea. Arrived 5min early and was told to have a seat as they would stick to the reservation time.  Was seated almost 10min after reservation.  Tea was good.  You get to taste two of them.  The “sandwiches” and desserts are fixed.  Sandwiches were pretty good and the desserts were just ok.  They don’t give any extras out of courtesy if you happen to like one thing over another.  Overall it was very pricey for what you get.  Felt like I overpaid quite a bit even before a 20% tip.  I probably wouldn’t revisit for the tea because of the price alone.   One time deal for me.  4 stars because nothing food/beverage wise was that bad overall.  I’m not opposed to suggesting this place if its within your budget.,4,GS606,Chicago
It was nice but not enough food was served and we had to wait a few times for our server,4,OpenTable Diner,London

"Beautiful room, good tea selection, EXCELLENT scones.",3,Cher,Hawaii
"We booked the prefix afternoon tea for our anniversary, and it was wonderful. The savories were well paired with tea recommended by our waiter, and the scones and desserts were unique and delicious. We made sure to take some home, as well as a relaxing camomile my wife loved. We will definitely be back soon.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"65 dollars per person = four 1-inch sandwiches (only one was 2""X1""),  2 normal size scones (both very sweet) and 4 tiny pastries that were excessively sweet.  One normal-size tea kettle, they offered to refill.   My husband reasoned that perhaps we were not paying for the food at all, but for the piano player (Ha! get a recording!).  little advise, 2 normal size ultra sweet scones are too much (and too easy to make), the pastries are overwhelmingly sweet - how about more savory mini sandwiches? how about more art into the food?  total overkill.   We invited our friends... so here we were, an attorney, NASA sci, an engineer and I, all dressed for  high tea (hat and all) and felt cheated. Next time we'll go to Travelle instead (better value).    No one at our table managed to eat the mini pastries...too much sweet.",1,Operata,Chicago
"Service was exceptional. Our server, Tony had a lot of patience with us. He recommended teas, took pictures for us, explained the menu throughly, and made us felt very cozy. The scones were delicious!! Warm and not too sweet.",5,Jennifer,Chicago
"Excellent service, beautiful ambience and phenomenal tea!",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Came here for the first time to celebrate my mother's birthday having afternoon tea on a Sunday at 2pm.  We were seated by the window and there were only a few other tables occupied.  A pianist performed behind me in the corner.  Next to each table was a tall metal holder where the waiter placed the plates of bite sized delectables.  He brought out our tea of choice first, and then the plates of savories.  After we finished that, he brought out two plates of baked goods and desserts.  Everything tasted great.  Then the waiter brought out a small slice of cake with a lit candle on the side while the pianist played happy birthday.  We couldn't finish all the food and asked to take it away.  Instead of bringing cups that we could use to fill with the jam, lemon curd and butter, they provided pre-packaged ones.  Personally, I prefer to take the ones on the table, as I am not a fan of waste, so I scooped what I could into the already filled cups.  I felt the pianist was playing on the keys a bit too heavy, but regardless, the place is elegant and I would definitely come back on a special occasion.",4,Midagegirl,Chicago
"The Langham delivers in every way possible.  Attentive staff, exquisite decor, delicious food, and five star treatment for every guest.  The Summer Tea with Wedgewood was incredible and is my new favorite high tea.",5,Anonymous,Chicago

"I scheduled afternoon tea for myself to mark a milestone birthday.  The experience was, in a word...exquisite.",5,KJODining1,Chicago
"Although the food and atmosphere were excellent, the price was extremely high for afternoon tea and the sandwich portion of the tea was small.  One to two bites per sandwich.  Scones were delicious, variety of tea good, but I can get all the same and more for half the price elsewhere.  Definitely not worth $65 per person.",4,piglover,Chicago
Great service,4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Wonderful service and food. Great experience. Will go back next time I'm in town.,5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Delicious tea and food. We brought our 4 yo son who they accommodated with kid friendly savory choices.  I would recommend.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Heard this was one of the best Restaurant Week offerings. Was received by a friendly hostess. Food was amazing, even being $44 3 course meal(expected less value) food portions and choices were premium. But what made it a great experience was wait staff, we won’t forget cause our server was Cesar(same as my name). He detailed the menu and made us feel at home. Will definitely go back.",5,CesarBolano,Chicago
"I went to Travelle for the restaurant week and overall I had a good experience. The food was very high quality, although somewhat inconsistent in the sense that the octopus/pork belly appetizer and the steak entree were heads and shoulders above the other items.   The service was a bit strange. Our main waiter was pretty slow and nonresponsive. It seemed like he was working on something else as he disappeared for long stretches. Another waiter--possibly a manager--apologized and gave us a discount on the bill, which was nice. But I wouldn't expect that to happen in a restaurant of this caliber. Perhaps our main waiter was a trainee?",4,SaltandFat,Chicago
"Food was outstanding, though the ""tasting portions"" for restaurant week were a tad small. This was made up for by the quality of the dishes and the service. Cocktails were fantastic as well, will definitely be back.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Casual elegance is a good description. Travelle has always been a reliable standby for us in Chicago. We were wary when chef Tim Graham was replaced by Ricardo Jarquin. But the new chef hasn't missed a beat. I love the vibe, very relaxed and elegant atmosphere, ideal for a evening of conversation, service is attentive. Most importantly the food is continues to rival all the trendy hotspots; a bit less of the prior mediterranean influences and more ""American;"" but a lovely and tasteful meal.",5,A2gourmand,Detroit
"Restaurant Week menu was interesting. Portions were small. Service not great. Spilled drinks, miscues on orders and timing.",4,Manwithplan,Chicago
Excellent food and ambience. A minor hiccup in service was corrected promptly and professionally. Will definatly return.,4,OpenTable Diner,New Orleans
"We enjoyed Travelle during restaurant week and to celebrate a birthday.  Typically restaurant week menus are quite limited, but they offered many delicious options!  Smoked burrata was great, as was the Octopus starter.  The strip was also delicious and we added the brussel sprouts and  potatoes as sides.  I guess we were hungry!  I slowed down by dessert, but my dining companion did not.  Travelle knew it was his birthday and when they confirmed over the phone, they told me that traditionally, the birthday person receives a cupcake with a candle on it -- I said sure!  Well, at the end of the meal I thought to myself, NO CUPCAKE!  Our awesome waiter, Thomas, must be psychic because he came over at the end of the meal with some prosecco and champagne glasses.  He said he noticed we'd slow down on the food and wanted us to still have a celebration.!  Great food, excellent service!",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Came in for Chicago Restaurant Week and had an amazing meal! Everything was delicious and the presentation showed creativity and pride in the food being served.

"I went for the restaurant week menu and was very happy with the choices. The Lemon Pavlova dessert was divine. The service was excellent throughout the meal, but I was done for quite a while and had to signal the server.to ask for the check.",4,linda,Chicago

The food and the service was excellent.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Everything was perfect, had a whole team of people that made the experience amazing and as always Paul our waiter was excellent but the whole team from entering to the meal were fantastic. They make you feel welcomed and went during restaurant week and had some incredible dishes from octopus to steak and a dessert that was amazing.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Went during restaurant week and the menu looked good. Out of the 4 entrees I chose the fish.  Probably not the way to go unless you are looking for a tasting menu portion as your entrée.  The octopus appetizer was good. Service lacked.  Ordered 2 bottles of white wine and the 2nd bottle came out at room temperature.   Don't see the need to go back.,3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"We went for Restaurant Week lunch and were disappointed. First, we both had to have the lunch - they would not do it for only one. The soup was delicious but it was downhill from there. The branzino was a 2 x 2 sliver that was not a quarter inch thick, and half of that was skin. I would say there were maybe 3 sliver sized bites of fish. The accompanying couscous and cauliflower was equally meager and bland. And the lemon dessert was dull. I have been to the Langham for tea, and it was outstanding. I would not go to Travelle for lunch again though. If Restaurant Week diners are second class diners, then please do not participate in Restaurant Week.",3,great2eatout,Chicago
"Went to lunch during 2018 Restaurant Week. Our group of eight ladies were seated in an eight-person table, privately between the wine/bar bottles. Wonderful setting. The atmosphere is very post; we wanted an elegant ladies lunch and we got it. The wait-staff were very attentive as was expected for this high-priced restaurant. The hostess was almost deferential and everyone made us feel special and like a ""guest"", not just like a customer. We got our coats checked (no charge) and water glasses were filled constantly. The food was tiny, tiny portions (there is no way a grown man used to meat and potatoes would eat here), but presented in such a way it felt like a treat. Definitely not a place to eat if you're a regular person who is famished. I had a cream soup, hanger steak, and chocolate cake. Surprisingly, I was full after lunch! Didn't know I would be! Coffee with dessert; and no problems getting our bill paid by eight various ways (we could have paid with one credit card and split it later, but the waiters were very happy to divvy up the bill between the eight of us). So nothing bad to say against this restaurant. I would DEFINITELY come here again; the afternoon tea looks to be special and this would be a great place for cocktails or showing off Chicago to friends or out-of-town co-workers. Thumbs up!",4,Kristy,Chicago

"This was emailed to the staff; I have not yet received a response: The service was sub-par (our Prosecco glasses were left empty the entire meal even when we had plenty of wine left in the bottle), but I am writing to tell you about what happened when our check arrived.  Please note that the sub-par service would not typically warrant an email.  When our server brought us the check, I double and triple checked to see if gratuity was added on the bill - it was not.  We had asked our check to split evenly into 8 credit cards  When our receipts came back, we all added gratuity onto the total.  Then I noticed the math did NOT add up.  It turned out that when the server went to run our credit cards, he ADDED the gratuity WITHOUT notifying us.  I'm not sure how often this happens, and how many time you guys are able to get away with it, but it is VERY VERY shady and unethical.  I can't believe the restaurant would condone such a thing, or you would hire such people that would do this.  I dine out very frequently and have worked in the service industry, and I have never come across such a situation.  I am absolutely appalled and disappointed.  Because of what happened with the bill, I will never be returning to your restaurant (the sub-par service was just the cherry on top).",1,Sadsoexpensive,Chicago

"Christmas Dinner at Travelle was the best meal we had while we were in Chicago.  We had a five course prix  fix that was truly outstanding. Started with a fresh hamachi sushi, followed by a pear and greens salad with roasted shallots(yum, yum).  We then had scallops that were the best ever. Scallops were seared perfectly, not salty, and set above a purée of parsnips and pork ragout. Sounds odd, but it was divine.  Brussels sprouts and crispy kale were the perfect topper. Had a braised short rib that was the perfect balance of the rich meat and sauce. He desserts was a delightful snowball with raspberry and chocolate. The best meal I had while visiting Chicago.",5,OpenTable Diner,Seattle
"Beautiful Christmas Eve brunch!  Asked to be moved to pavilion where afternoon tea is usually served for a gorgeous window view of the bridge to the river.  Amazing variety of scrumptious dishes.  Ramen, sushi, amazing king crab legs.  Carving station with delicious ribeye.  Salad bar with so many options!  Loved the fresh homemade tacos and tostadas.  Belgium waffles like I had in Brussels, fabulous fruit toppings (cherries, yum!).  Dessert options were mind blowing, loved the coconut dessert.  Adored the hot chocolate bar with choice of toppings!  Wish I had another stomach to eat with!  Service was impeccable!  Compliments to the chefs, servers, and managers of Travelle for a fabulous Christmas 2017 celebration.  Great personal touches such as Santa and the manager stopping by our table to greet us.",5,FoodieJ,Chicago

"If you're looking for a place with ambiance but not too much noise so that you and friends can catch up, this is the place.

"I haven't reviewed a restaurant yet but boy, this restaurant is terrible. I can't believe how they try to sell themselves as this high-dining, quality food place. The dishes were so overpriced and really underwhelming. One entree was scallops for $38 which featured 3 small scallops and about 2 ounces of cauliflower and wild rice. It was ridiculous. The amount of food actually given and the quality was such crap for the price we paid. This restaurant needs to fail.",1,Tastypalet,Chicago
"While the service and atmosphere were quite good, the food was not.  Sauce on lamb shank was cold, no pumpkin in the pumpkin tart, bagged (or so it seemed) potato chips with the tartar (really? come on now!)  Pot de creme was very good.  Will ot be back for just that though.",3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"My friends and I ordered from the Restaurant Week Menu, the salmon and the mushroom risotto.  The portions were nice but unfortunately, both dishes were bland.  And we couldn't understand the apple pancake dessert with the lump a butter, too much butter.  The pumpkin soup was interesting, to our surprise it wasn't sweet.",3,ElizabethO,Dined 3 days ago
I would not recommend Atwood.  It was restaurant week and the offerings were few and not appealing.  We ordered off the regular menu and the food came lukewarm..not acceptable.  The food is overpriced.,3,Siesta,Chicago
"The restaurant week menu was somewhat limited.  We were told that the lamb in mole was quite spicy, so we had the risotto and the salmon.  The waitress told us we could not have the lamb without the spicy sauce, as everything was prepared earlier.  The food was well prepared and tasty. However we got our entrees while we were still eating the appetizers.  The restaurant had several empty tables, yet we could not get an earlier reservation.  The desserts were good, but not extraordinary.   The cocktails were a little pricey, and not very strong.",3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"The service and ambiance are stellar but the food is overpriced for the quality. The Ribeye was a really poor, thin, fatty cut of meat that reminded me of something uncle Rico would eat from Napoleon Dynamite. It was served lukewarm at best. The crispy salmon was a little better but nothing to write home about.   I highly recommend for a intimate date night for drinks but there’s a lot better food nearby at The Dearborn or a couple blocks north at Prime and Provisions for similar prices.",3,OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 3, 2018"
Stopped in for Restaurant Week menu and had a great experience. Service was very good (greatly appreciate when a server actually provide recommendations - and good ones!) and very good meal. The pumpkin soup was creamy with just the right amount of spice and steak tartar was one of the best ever had. Lamb shank was tender (fell off the bone) and the portion was so big we both enjoyed it. Salmon was good but nothing like the lamb. Will definitely come back.,4,YumSteak,Los Angeles
"We hadn't been to Atwood in quite some time. The food on the Restaurant Week menu was really outstanding—salmon and lamb shank, in particular. The service was also fine, though they need another bartender to get drinks to the table more rapidly. I did miss the old, curved booths that they once had. Now, neighbouring tables are a bit too much on top of one another, which, along with the louder-than-necessary music, makes it hard to hear at times.",4,RandyA,Chicago
"Terrific food and the service was impeccable! Went for Chicago Restaurant Week, and will be back for more.",5,JenW,Chicago
"food was very good- the lamb shank was memorable. I'm usually a tough critic so the food would have been about a 3.75 however the service? That made up for the 1.25 and another 50. My waitress was so sweet and fun, helpful, cheerful. The hostess chatted for a bit as it was an off-time of day. The gorgeous bartender made some killer cocktails. Even the bus staff were overly helpful and kind. Can't wait to eat and DRINK there again!",5,auntie,Chicago
"The interior is beautiful but the quality of the food here has really declined. Business meal - 3 colleagues, 3 different dishes - all very mediocre. Meh. Pretty interior, but not enough when the food doesn't taste good.",3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Quaint bistro style hotel restaurant on the ground floor. The food was subtle with classic choice of sauces and well done meat. The service is great and seating is limited  which makes it a great date night spot.,4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Service was good, attentive and polite. However, dining there was a disappointing experience. The food was bland, presentation was lacking, and the desserts were terrible. The crostata dessert was soggy and there was no color on the shell, it looked as if it was warmed up on the microwave. Tried one bite, and ended up leaving both desserts there.",1,CMAT,Chicago

We visited Atwood on a whim after our anniversaty date at the Chicago Sympony Orchestra. It's easily within walking distance and we avoided the post-show gridlock in the parking garage.

"We enjoyed our pre-concert meal at Atwood. While the food was good but not extraordinary, the service was friendly and attentive which means a lot. Relaxed and spacious dinning room and it was not too loud.Food is on the rustic side, well prepared and nicely presented just not mind-blowing. If you are in that neighborhood, it's a good go!",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"A friend recommend Atwood as a good place to dine.  We had a 5:45 reservation,  (but would have preferred 6:30) and upon arriving at 5:40, the restaurant was only about 20% occupied.  It didn't start filling up until after 7.  The service was excellent except the server checked on us a little too often in my opinion, disrupting our conversation.   (But that's better than not checking enough.)   The pork chop my date ordered was tough, but they did take it off our check.  The salmon I had was very good and so were our salads.  The wine pour I thought was small for $15 a glass.  Also the Coke came in a very small bottle (maybe 6 or 8 oz) and we were charged separatly for each bottle.  The chocolate cake dessert  they serve is delicious but enough for 6 people.",3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago

"We had lunch there prior to a matinee.  Our server, Jeff, was excellent.  Excellent location for lunch prior to any matinee in the theatre district.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Our meal started with some Beet Toast and pumpkin soup. For dinner we had Amish Chicken and Brussels Sprouts!   Beet Toast with pistachios/goat cheese had nice flavor profiles with 2 kinds of beets. Pumpkin Soup was savory and had pumpkin seeds in the soup! FANTASTIC!  Amish Chicken was extremely moist/flavorful along with the puree of potatoes matched perfectly with the Brussels Sprouts which were sweet and crisp at the same time.    Every item was unique and memorable with along with lighting up the taste buds.,5,Bruce60586,Chicago
Outstanding value on their pre prix offering.  More than enough food  and everyone really enjoyed their choices.  Loved the staff.

A small group of 4 of us went to Atwood prior to seeing a show.  The waitstaff was very helpful in gently encouraging us to place our orders so that we would not miss the show.  Only real negative was the description on a few of the small plates from the waitress.  Portions were much different than what was explained/expected.,5,Morgan,Pittsburgh
"Long standing restaurant that has gone through a refreshing facelift.   Great corner location  for views of passersby.  Food was beautifully presented and staff was very attentive.  We had early reservations on a Wednesday evening, so the bar and restaurant were slow upon our arrival.  Filled up nicely and was lively.   We walked from CIBC Theatre easily.  Will go again.",4,OpenTable Diner,Indiana
Never knew of The Atwood before but will visit again and recommend to others.  Service was above and beyond.  It is a wonderful location for any activity in the Loop including theaters. Thank you.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"The food menu is small, but the selection is such that most diners will find something they like. We picked from the fixed price menu—$32 for your choice from 3 appetizers, 3 entrees, and 3 desserts. All sounded delicious. One of us chose the salad for the first course, while I picked the pumpkin soup. We were both happy with our selections, but I would have to say that the pumpkin soup was the best I have ever had—served very hot, perfectly seasoned, and very creamy. Next, my wife  ordered the salmon and I had the pork chop, which was served on a layer of cheesy grits and ribbons of squash. Again, we were both well pleased. Rather than rush through dessert (we had tickets to see Hamilton), we ordered our desserts to go, and dropped them off in our room in the hotel to eat later. Mine was an Italian custard (delicious and rich) and my wife's was chocolate layer cake. It was the largest piece of cake either one of us had ever seen—one quarter of a large 3 layer chocolate cake with rich icing—it must have weighed 3 pounds. I helped her with it, but the two of us couldn't finish it. Seems like a waste, but the cake was excellent. The drinks beforehand were excellent, too. My wife had a champagne cocktail of some sort and I had their signature Manhattan cocktail, which is made with rye and served up in a classy stemmed glass.",5,JohnS,Indiana
"Took an aunt out for her birthday lunch.  Service was attentive and our server was fun. The menu was small, but the chopped salad was delicious!",4,Joanne,Phoenix

"This is a first rate restaurant located in a first rate hotel.  Beautiful sophisticated, authentic but modern atmosphere.  Clearly the chef, and the staff have high standards for food and service.  Went here the morning after seeing Hamilton with my wife and daughters.  It was the absolute perfect place to discuss the show and enjoy amazing and delicious food.  I would not hesitate to return for lunch or dinner the next time I am in Chicago for a play.",5,OpenTable Diner,Milwaukee

"Delicious food (we had one vegetarian and one gluten-intolerant in our group and they had delicious options, as well) and wonderful service. We had time constraints after the theater to catch a train and they were happy to accommodate us.  Max and the other servers were terrific and fun. All six of us will recommend Atwood.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Amazing remodel of the space giving it a very European feel.  The menu is small, but still offers something for everyone and the service was impeccable.

"Restaurant was going through renovation( long overdue). They should have mentioned this.  Food was good but did not all come out on time.  Entry into Willis Tower was supervised by sourpuss security guard which put a damper on things from the get go. Security people were dour and unhelpful. No valet or parking; another strike.  Website stated that jackets for gentlemen were required on Saturday nights, so I expected a much more elegant evening. I was the only one in a suit, every other male in the room was wearing a sweater, including the maitre'd.  Did not come close to meeting our expectations for a dressy, romantic date. Disappointing.

"Loved the ambiance, darker lighting, great view of the river! I thought the snacks were really good and a nice touch (peppered popcorn and sriracha almonds). Didn't order cocktails from the menu, but ordered vodka and soda and a whiskey ginger. Waitress brought out an almost full glass of liquor and a bottle of tonic and ginger for us to mix the drink how we liked it. It was a very generous pour to say the least, so I thought the price point for that was extremely reasonable. Had the Wagyu sliders which were pretty good, but not mindblowing.  The fries were awesome! Definitely an awesome place to go have a drink or two with a friend and have some discussion.",5,Fire,Pittsburgh

Only had appetizers - charcuterie and mushroom quesadilla. Both were wonderful. And excellent Martinis!!,5,OpenTable Diner,Charleston
"It was a nice bar. Beautiful view of the river at night. We originally wanted to go to Terrace 1 a few floors up and have a class of wine but once we read that it cost $100 per head just to get a table, we decided to just go with the 2nd floor bar...and it's $20 drinks.....you know...where us upper middle class peasants apparently belong in trump's tower. :)",5,seads,Austin
"Amazing view but worst, and I mean worst, service ever. Went there after a gala and the server was so incredibly rude we thought he was joking. Not sure if he was having a horrible day but he was actually hostile. He belonged in a diner as he sat the tray with drinks down on the table  and started shouting out the drinks so we could tell him who had what. Manager apologized but it was like a twilight zone experience.  It's too bad because it ended our evening on a sour note.",2,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Real nice Rosè cart and great crab roll.  Great view as well.,4,JK405,Chicago
Great service and food. Everyone loved it!,5,OpenTable Diner,Seattle
Amazing service and nice decor. Loved the drinks and bruschette we ordered!,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Every time we travel to Chicago my husband and I visit Rebar.  The view overlooking the Chicago River is amazing.  The service is very professional.  The atmosphere is comfortable.  The drinks are a little pricey, but expected.  Well worth the visit.",5,OpenTable Diner,Cleveland
"We stopped in for cocktails prior to attending the CSO and was very impressed with the ambiance, the mixologist and thought the location was excellent for the River North area.",4,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
I only put a three for ambience because they are under construction at this time. Otherwise it would’ve been great.,5,indydani,Indiana
Absolutely beautiful setting ... A very quiet ... very classy dining venue ... A perfect setting for a dining experience if one needs conversation &amp; privacy ... First class ... This kind of restaurant is unique &amp; hard to find ... YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED !!!!,4,OpenTable Diner,Phoenix
"This is my fourth time having dined at the Metropolitan Club. My experience with the food, service and wine list have been spot on everytime, but the scenic view of the City of Chicago from the 67th floor of Willis Tower is breathtaking. I highly recommend that you take in this unique opportunity that dining at the Metropolitain Club has to offer.",5,Dinone,Washington DC
The restaurant needs an update as it seems to be stuck in the 80's.,4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
The food was really good. Service was an F. It took 30 mins for drinks and the server disappears .,4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Great view and wonderful service. Drinks were on point.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Superb meal and a great view. A table overlooking downtown Chicago at night, well prepared food, and an attentive and pleasant server made our evening special. The spinach and goat cheese salad and the roasted pear salad were both fresh and delicious. Our entrees, veal saltimbocca and tea brined pork chop were very well prepared. Definitely a restaurant to return to.",5,stinky,Washington DC
It was nice but I wish we didn't have to pay 20% upcharge or surcharge,5,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
"We celebrated a birthday.  It was a nice evening that included the skydeck. They were thoughtful for the birthday celebration.  They decorated the dessert plate and gave us a complimentary glass of champagne. The 20% percent surcharge which the menu stated covered the tip was a bit confusing. At the end of the dinner the waitress stated that the 20% tip did not come to her but was instead shared by the staff. I gave a little more for her but I thought that was a bit off-putting, isn't that the normal way tipping is done at a restaurant it is shared? I've never worked at a restaurant I only assumed. The waitress was a bit slow and not as attentive as I saw the other wait staff being with others. Overall it was a nice evening. The only complaint I really had was the location of our table it was in the middle of the floor away from the windows so we could not see the view, the only other tables in the middle of the floor where large parties set. We felt like we were on display. Everyone else in parties of two sat along the windows. There were tables available along the window but we were not offered them.",3,Munchee,Chicago
Great outing loved the view. My fiancé really enjoyed her birthday dinner,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Had a great first date.  Amazing views - be great to be there once the windows are cleaned!  Great drinks, food, atmosphere.  Would go back.  Loved that the chef met my special request (chocolate covered strawberries) for dessert.",4,BigDave,Chicago
"Our server Victor was truly great on this visit.  My husband &amp; I were visiting Chicago and I found the TripAdvisor deal for this restaurant.  This was a great deal and was a special occasion, my birthday.  Right off the bat, Victor asked us where we were from and if this was a special occasion.  We had great interactions with him throughout the meal.  I got the mustard crusted lamb chops with a mint brown gravy and my husband got the veal saltimbocca.  Both were fantastic!  For our dessert, he made the night very special for my birthday by adding a candle and special birthday message!",5,AimeeB28078,Charlotte
"Tout simplement surfait, la cuisine n'est pas à la hauteur. L'endroit est propre et joli, mais toutes les tables ne proposent pas une vue imprenable sur Chicago. De plus, quand bien même nous ne sommes pas près d'une fenêtre, le manager aurait pu penser à laisser un espace pour profiter de la vue sans ennuyer les autres clients ... En synthèse, nous avons mangé et nous sommes partis sans profiter de l'endroit. l'addition est salée au regard de la qualité du repas. Je ne recommande pas cette table.",2,OpenTable Diner,Tampa
"Would have loved to be seated at the window looking over the lake as requested, however we were sat in a tucked away spot on the oposite side of the room.   Other then that it was a nice experience with good food and service!",4,MaryBethG1111,Chicago
"Worst ambience in Chicago, couldn’t enter the main dining area bc I had on nice sneakers, had a jacket on,  food is boring , get out of the past, go somewhere else",1,OpenTable Diner,Oklahoma City
Need revamp of menu. Take the deep fried chicken wings off menu. They are more similar to McNuggets. Just not good food.,3,BARBD,"Dined on August 18, 2017"
Highly recommended!  Amazing views.  Excellent experience.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
The Metropolitan Club was definitely worthy of a return visit since my last Chicago trip! Rare is the opportunity to find fine high rise dining in the sky. This experience is the pinnacle of my trip and is what made it most memorable. Salmon citronella is the choice of seafood cuisine. I would do this again if I'm ever back to the Windy City for another tour!,5,CalebOinAustin,San Francisco
"40th Anniversary celebration with romantic view overlooking Chicago from 67 floors above. Service was OK, but not worthy of the occasion. Food was good, but for the price should have been great. My wife had the salmon and I had the veal.  Did have a private club feel and was not ever full for the duration of our meal on a Saturday night.  I would recommend for a romantic special occasion for the view, but would  go somewhere else for the perfect meal.",3,OpenTable Diner,Nashville
I surprised my good friend with dinner here for her birthday. Not only did she love eating here for her first time but I was also amazed throughout the entire evening. The food was excellent and the service was great. Overall it was one of the nicest dinner experiences that I have had and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone. Well worth the money.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

Nice place.... it close to early..... Great facility..... snak bar ... like others...,4,AdrianMoralesvazquez20150,México
I went with friends for a drink.  The bar had a beautiful view of the river.  We were seated in comfortable conversation chairs right in front of the windows.  The staff were friendly and knowledgeable about the drink menu.  I'd love to go back and  sample the bar menu.  It looked delicious.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago

Food had such great flavor.  Salmon tartar great flavor profile.  Fried chicken  sliders nice to share.,5,MichaelBlane,Atlantic City
Excellent service and great food. Really beautiful view of the river and city from the large windows along the length of the restaurant.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Our favorite bar in the city! Best views to sit and relax in front of. The seasonal cocktails are truly unique.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Great drinks! Pink Affair is still my favorite! It's not on the menu but you can still order it. Awesome view of the river! Service is amazing! The popcorn on the table is delicious! Can't wait for summer!!,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Great place for a business drink and discussion. Quiet, classy, great service.",5,Hillymd,Chicago
"No draft beer, only bottles :(. Cocktails were pricey, but delicious. One was served in a glass with cherry wood smoke sitting on top of the whiskey drink. Fancy! Had another cocktail that was hot tea, gin, and fruit. Super delicious, never had something like that before. The lounge has a nice view of the Chicago river with floor to ceiling windows.",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
beautiful place and great views..  service was fine - although server was new....  food looked interesting and wish we would have had a chance to try some..  a bit pricey..  but very TRUMP!! we will be back!,4,OpenTable Diner,Portland

Perfect as always.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
This was my first visit. I wanted to share a special  birthday experience for my daughter.  I thought we were going to have dinner on the 16th floor. When we got there they informed us that the 16th floor was closed. This mezzanine area was a huge disappointment. I will never attend again.  Raymond Ejnik,2,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
We were here early the night before Thanksgiving.  Able to get a spot right by the window.  Staff attentive but not annoying.   Drinks were good.   Will be back.,4,Motomom327,Dallas

"We couldn't decide what we liked more, the delicious meal or the fantastic view.  Service was excellent too.  We plan to go back again soon.",5,luncher,Chicago
"I was excited to go to this Private Clubby place, but I was not impressed. The space was nice and the ""experience"" was good and the food was ok. Had the lobster ravioli and the seared scallops as an appetizer and they were great. If I ever went back, I would have them as a dinner. The filet for dinner was tender, but the strong smell of the smoked bacon when the plate was set down in front of me totally overpowered the steak. For the $200.00+ for 2 people, it was just ok. I would  say for me that it was a one time experience...great date night or to take someone out you want to impress due to the clubs exclusivity. The servers were knowledgeable and personable.",3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"I know it's all about the view, but the food is truly dreadful.",2,glutenanddairyfreefoodie,Chicago

Spectacular views and very good food.  Service was top notch.  Very happy with our experience.,5,OpenTable Diner,Philadelphia
We had the best experience with Victor as our waiter tonight. He was so sweet and had the best recommendations. I love personable waitstaff and he was so attentive and charismatic. It was my first time at the metropolitan club and I took my best friend for her birthday. They made it so special and perfect it was much appreciated. We will definitely be back.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago

This was one for the ages! An out of this world fine dining experience. Up high on the Willis Tower in Chicago. Yes quite a pricey meal to be done. Then again this something that is done on seldom occasion. In my case an adventure/sightseeing trip to the Windy City. If you come to Chicago be sure to put the Metropolitan Club in your bucket list of dining. You will be in for a great time!,5,CalebOinAustin,San Francisco
Enjoyed a very nice dinner Saturday night.  All 4 in our party loved their food!  Wait staff was very cordial &amp; helpful.  We were late getting up there as our Uber driver let us out at the incorrect door &amp; we didn't know we had to go thru security before getting on the elevator...  Staff was very accommodating.,5,shorty,Milwaukee
Service from all staff was exceptional!,5,Jandy,Chicago
What a wonderful evening!  Everything was perfect from the moment we walked in until the moment we left...including the security staff on the main level.  I recommend the Metropolitan Club to anyone who wants something more special than the average restaurant.  We are fortunate in Chicago to have so many choices for excellent dining -- the view from the 67th floor just adds that extra something.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Fantastic, picturesque, great value will renew my membership.",4,keitht,Chicago

"I was very excited to have dinner at Boleo because they had amazing reviews, but I was quite disappointed. The place is beautiful, the cocktails were good, the food was okay, but the portions were RIDICULOUS. The food menu is very limited, they have only like 10 options and for what it is, it is overpriced. The tuna and the ceviche were okay, but I literally ate it all in three bites. I would only recommend Boleo for a few cocktails. The waitress was very nice.",4,Mariana,Chicago
Great venue. Food was good but very small portions for the price.,5,OpenTable Diner,Minneapolis
We stopped here after the theatre. It is a lovey setting. Our drinks were amazing!  We tried a couple of small plate items and they were both very good. The best was our waiter Nick!  He moved a table for us so we could have a view out the glass roof into Chicago. It was a very nice jester. He also brought up complementary Champaign. We were celebrating our anniversary. Each time he came to our table he had a smile on his face!  The whole experience here was a wonderful ending to our anniversary day!!!,5,DeeCN,Chicago
Everything we tried was amazing.  The Chef even made us a specific dish based upon his appearance on Beat Bobby Flay.  Can't recommend it enough.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"I proposed to my now fiancé at Boleo, and I could not be more complimentary. They were incredibly helpful and accommodating, they worked with my friends to position everything for pictures (unbeknownst to my fiancé), and they provided great service throughout our time there. I always want to spend my money for good people, and I will definitely be back here.  Also, the prices were great and ambiance/décor was great. I did not eat here, but I am excited to.",5,Daniel,Raleigh
"Food selection was very limited. Food tasted great, however expensuve for what is provided, not good for a meal. Drinks and atmosphere is great for lounging and socializing.",3,Jeff,San Francisco
"Our family of four enjoyed a great early dinner composed of small plates before heading to see Hamilton.  All of the staff (maitre'd, server, multiple bussers) was very friendly and stayed right on top of everything to help us make sure we finished in time for the show.  The menu is rather small, but has fantastic variety from ceviche (my favorite) through melt-in-your-mouth steak (big hiyt with my son).",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Food was great, service not so much. I would recommend going during the summer when they presumably have more wait staff (and the roof is open).",3,EV5020,Washington DC
Great restaurant! We celebrated our 2nd anniversary. It was our first time at Boleo. We got very romantic table in a quiet place. Our waiter was very helpful and fast.

Great spot for happy hour tapas/dinner before a show!,4,Bean111,Louisville
"I found the food creative and delicious, especially the dishes recommended and / or served by the chef. My friend and I really enjoyed being able to choose from the tasting / tapas menu and the combination of ingredients in each dish was phenomenal. We each had two mezcal cocktails (Abuela), which we both really enjoyed. However, while I thought the pour was generous, the alcohol content could have been a little higher.",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Amazing place to eat. Everyone was so nice and attentive. Food was fantastic and the drinks are to die for! First time here and I will be coming back!,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago

This place is amazing! Great cocktails and really good food! The ambience is beautiful! I highly recommend it!,5,Fina,Chicago
"I didn't realise it was going to be so loud at 7:30pm, we were unable to talk without shouting but the food was flavourful and our server was very sweet.  The atmosphere and open roof made it feel very club / dance like. Which is perfect for after dinner drinks and dancing.  Luckily my nearly 80 year old Mom said it was an experience and could turn her hearing aids down.",3,Suzy,Chicago
"Expensive drinks for what you get, the cocktails were watered and iced down. My cocktail only had few sips since it contained 90% miniscule ice. Unknowledgeable waitress, she could not answer some of the questions we had about the menu. We ended up saying that we will google it. The ambiance was okay but it was empty on a Friday night. Overall unimpressed, we will not come back or recommend to anyone.",2,YSKT,New York Area
"Food was pretty good but had issues with service. Several times our waiter (Jason) just disappeared. Finally we asked for our waiter from the busboy and another  came and took our next order. We asked what happened to Jason and she said he was on break. No other explanation, no apology he was probably on  Break for at least 30 minutes.  funny thing and all this was the result two other tables that were having dinner at that moment. Bottom line, pretty good food, spotty service and the music was much too loud.",3,OpenTable Diner,St. Louis
"We had just gotten back from a trip to Peru and were excited to try some of their small plates. The food was very pretty, but didn't taste very good. Almost everything was bland. The cocktails were great and when the roof opened the fresh air was very nice.",2,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Excellent service and interesting, amazing food. Smaller portions. Great cocktails!",5,AshM,Chicago
This place is a hidden gem in the loop!! First time dining here.  Great experience! Food and service was excellent. Setting was perfect  at this rooftop bar with a Latin band. Drinks &amp; tapas were delicious. There were even a couple unexpected happy hour specials.   Molly was our waitress and was terrific in describing  all dishes (small plates). Made my friend's birthday extra special. Will definitely be back!,5,Lak6300,Chicago
"We had a great dinner at Boleo. We stayed for the featured DJs in the later evening. Beautiful crowd made for great people watching. Molly was an awesome server with delicious recommendations for food and drinks. I'd recommend the arroz chaufa, maybe two bowls.",5,OpenTable Diner,Washington DC
The Boleo is breath taking and the food was delicious and the service was equal to the taste of the food.  Can't wait to return.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"This was the second time we have been to Boleo and have enjoyed both times.  Love the food, love the DJ, love the drinks!",4,pcdiner,Indiana
"Loved the rooftop Bar. I meet there with my friend who came and visit from Mexico, We loved Rice it was delicious and all the handcrafted drinks. Note if you order pisco sour note that it has raw egg.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Boleo? More like Bole-whoa. This was my first time coming here for a dinner date. I was a bit unsure at first if this would be a good date spot since my first 2 times here were late at night and the music was super loud. However, coming at dinner hours, it was just right. Although the first two times I was here I enjoyed the energetic, live music! The service was wonderful. The authentic Peruvian dishes and a rotating list of creative, hand-crafted cocktails make a perfect combination and the environment provided a unique experience with the retracted roof as the sun set over Chicago.",5,TalaSol,Chicago
"I have been to Boleo a couple of times and I haven't been disappointed.  Energetic atmosphere, inventive drinks and wonderful food.  The food is small plates so you can try a variety of items.   The noise level it a bit high so don't go there for an intimate evening, but it does have a romantic/sexy vibe.  Added to all of that, is the open-roof with great views of the surrounding skyline.  Very unique and something to be experienced.",5,kaba,Chicago
"Not great food, ambiance was nice.  The menu is minimal so you may want to eat a bit before :)",3,OpenTable Diner,Orange County
The absolute best octopus I've ever had in my life! Came in for the new Tropical Disco programming every Wednesday night and I was blown away.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago

"Amazing service, beautifully decorated and every single dish stood on its own w delicacy and full flavor.",5,OpenTable Diner,Miami
The food was mediocre... we ordered from the happy hour menu... waiter said that the chicken kabobs were very hot however they were luke warm at best... we ordered the happy hour special of empanadas at 806 and when they were brought out we were informed that they would not be included in the happy hour pricing.  When ch is fine but maybe they should inform us when we order?   The music was great... service was slow,2,Chidiner,Chicago
"Boleo is a hidden gem in the city.  Great food and cocktails at a reasonable price.  Good place for all kinds of things.  Saw coworkers in large groups there, some of the space was rented out for a company.  There was a DJ then live music but not overwhelming.  Rooftop also although it was too cool for it the day we went.  Definitely recommend if you're downtown or before going to a show.",5,Chris,Chicago
"Great restaurant. The ceviche and the tiradito were amazin, and the cocktails too. A little bit expensive, but worth it.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Been coming here for years. Fantastic restaurant. The food is great. Service is awesome. Always a great experience.,5,CAPORELLI,San Francisco
Delicious  Will definitely go back,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Service was a little slow and food took awhile but they were full so as to be expected. Tried everyone’s food and everyone’s was good. My way chicken was great the cheese sauce with mushrooms was amazing. The stufffed shells special with sausage was good even though the vodka sauce was a little bland. My way ravioli- good. Chicken Marsala good.  Reasonable prices. It was a birthday dinner and we requested a high chair with our reservation.,4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"The wine list had apparently changed but the waitress was unaware. She poured the bottle of wine without presenting the wine bottle or pouring a taste. The bottle was not what we ordered and was not on the wine list. When asked she said she was told this was the same. When we pointedly this out to the owner he became angry snd said his wine man told him it was the same thing. There was nothing wrong with the wine except that we ordered a Sangiovese and Cabernet blend and the wine that was served was 100% Sangiovese. Rather than listen to our explanation of this fact, the owner walked off in a huff. The food was okay but the owner ruined the dining experience with his rude behavior.",3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Food is consistently excellent....seem to sometime rush you though ....,4,JoJo,Chicago
"Usually a good stop. Place was not full, however it took a long time to get our dinners. Portions seem to have been reduced since our last visit. Only has the house dressing for salads.",3,Chops,Chicago

"My Way Ristorante is like a quaint neighborhood restaurant with a little be of class.  The service was excellent, prompt, responsive, and knowledgeable.  The food was truly outstanding.  This restaurant is not close to us, but it is definitely worth the drive.   We will be back.",5,Davem720,Chicago
GREAT food !! BUT the tables were extremely close AND the noise level was loud we could barely talk. Definitely go back,3,MrMa,Chicago
The food and wine were both very good.  We have been there several times and have never been disappointed.,5,TrudyV,Chicago
Food was Great. Good Price. The owner walking around to make sure your food  was good and any thing else you may need. Small place but great food.,5,cspiz,Chicago
"I enjoyed the food , there was a good variety and reasonably priced.   The tables are a little close which raises the noise level.  The main problem was the owner is a pushy jerk.  He rushed us in ordering (he told someone at out table to make up his mind ) and was clearing away plates before we were even finished with them.   I ordered an additional glass of wine which never came but did appear on my bill.",2,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"This is a great place to meet friends for good food, good service, and good conversation.  We have never been disappointed!",5,Sigma,Chicago
I don't like giving bad reviews but I would not try this place.  Service is slow they had no busboys when we were there the waitress does everything it's very small so you are in your neighbors table or within 3 inches of it it's noisy and hot.  The food is so so.,2,Seedub,Chicago
"Food much better on previous visits. Salad was much smaller than previous. Veal was very chewy, not as good as before.",3,BOBG8610,Chicago
"We all enjoyed our meal very much.  Everything was delicious.  For appetizers we had mozzarella caprese salad, clams, and sausage and peppers.  Entrees our table enjoyed were ribeye, filet, lemon chicken and chicken saltimbocca.  It was all outstanding.  Desserts were also great.  It was a little bright for my liking, they seemed to turn the lights down later though.  One drawback was there are no GF pasta options on the menu.  The owner was super friendly and accommodating.  The server was very attentive.  Will definitely return.",5,ETolo,Chicago
Food is always delicious and hot! We have never had a bad meal at My Way!,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago

"We had another wonderful evening at My Way Restaurant. Our server was very kind and knowledgeable about the menu. She even brought over a dish for us to view that we were thinking about. The bottle of ""special"" wine was a great value and quite good and the calamari on special was to die for as well! The owner always greets us with a smile and makes us feel like family!",5,hurls,Chicago
"Good food at reasonable prices.  This visit lively outside dining area.  Inside sat by kitchen which was not my favorite location.  Smaller place so can be noisy.  Overall, I would return due to superior service and good, reasonably priced food.",4,OpenTable Diner,Los Angeles
It was very loud .  Our waitress was very inattentive.  We were literally ignored.   Table next to ours came in after us  and they were served before we were.  Item on the menu very pricey too.   Overall experience was terrible.,1,OpenTable Diner,Chicago

"Always enjoy eating with friends and relatives at""My Way"".  Service and food are always great! I happen to be hooked on their Whitefish francase that gives me lightly breaded whitefish on thin spaghetti surrounded by a tasty white sauce. Yummy! Also enjoyed the artichoke hearts appetizer to start the meal. We never go away hungry.",5,Charles,Phoenix
"Excellent food and service.  A little loud because of its cozy size and depending on the amount of diners, but well worth a visit if you enjoy great food.",4,RicMic,Miami
Have been to this restaurant several times and have never been disappointed. Nice and quiet with great food. Owner was very friendly and thanked us for dining there - shook our hand.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"We were very disappointed in this visit. It was so loud you couldn't even hear the person sitting next to you. The service was poor. The restaurant is way too crowded which contributed to the terrible noise. The temperature in the restaurant was either way too hot or way too cold alternating. The owner/host is rude and very strange. He kept coming by our table as if he was going to say something and never did. We watched him take a dirty table from the outside porch and bring it in to add for a big party and the table didn't even fit. We felt sorry for the people who had to sit at the ""kids table"". The food is good, but not so great as to make up for the terrible ambiance. Even though we had a reservation, we were put at a table by the bathroom which was practically in the bathroom. So we had to put up with that on top of everything else.",3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Enjoyed another wonderful meal at My Way Ristorante in Willow Springs, a gem in the southwest suburbs. Excellent - freshly made meals and desserts. Tiramisu made on site!!! Daily specials are phenomenal, including wine pairings, kitchen staff really knows their cuisine. The owner Ted and his staff are welcoming and attentive. Great place for couples, special celebrations, family, friends too! Consider making reservations on the weekend evenings in winter, but warm weather outside dining is enjoyable. Highly recommended, always a pleasure to dine at My Way Ristorante.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Celebrated my father in law's birthday tonight. Phenomenal food &amp; exceptional service. Stuffed mushroom app &amp; linguine with clams (white sauce) entree were absolutely delicious! Cannot wait to come back!,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Food is outstanding.....but feel we are always rushed!,3,JoJo,Chicago
Always good food and good service.  A great place to meet friends.,5,Sigma,Chicago
"This is an attractive neighborhood fine dining establishment. There are decent, moderately priced wine selections. Good food created with fresh ingredients! There are some alfresco tables, when weather permits, but the lovely woodwork makes the interior seem warm and inviting. Immaculately clean. Prompt, efficient service. We like it!",5,DoZe,Chicago
My way pork was super delish. Also whirefish limone; very fresh!,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"We drive 30 minutes to dine here!  In 4 years of dining, we have not had a bad experience!  Wonderful restaurant and staff!",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Favorite dishes: Whitefish is excellent  Ravioli Veal Marsala Dover Sole,4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Food was terrific but the appetizer special - though very good - was a bit pricey.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
The sausage stuffed chicken was wonderful!  Can't wait to go back and order it again!,4,MaryAnnK,Chicago
"The food was great and the service very personable, timely, and appropriate.  We enjoyed our first visit and plan to return very soon.",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"FOOD WAS VERY GOOD, BUT THE RESTAURANT IS IN A BIG RUSH TO TURN TABLES. OUR DINNER WAS EXTREMELY RUGHED, IN AND OUT IN 45 MINUTES. WE HAD WINE, ORDOURVES, ENTREE, BUT JUST HORRIBLY QUICK. EVERYONE WAS FOCUSED ON TABLE TURN. IF YOU GO TELL THEM TO GO SLOW.",3,BOBG8610,Chicago
The Lobster roll  bun was stale🤨,3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
First visit at Steadfast as part of Chicago Restaurant Week. The meal was exceptionally delicious. My server was incredibly attentive.  The Mango Cheesecake was divine!  I will be happy to go back and check out the rest of the menu.,5,AMV84,Chicago
"We were there at later dinner on Saturday for our date night. It was a great quite slow due to the fact that the financial district gets quite after 5-6pm and it was very cold night. But we really enjoyed almost private dining set up and the food, service and interior ambience was all top notch. We will definitely go back for a romantic dinner out.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"The food was too pretentious, too many ingredients and flavors.",2,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Went for restaurant week. The meal was very good overall and a good value. Service was a bit rocky at first, but the maitre'd was on the ball and got our service back on track. The pumpkin soup was good, but the standout starter was the veal neck with gnocchi - well worth springing an extra $11 for the 4 course option. The filet mignon was likely smaller than the normal menu filet mignon (hopefully so, because it was not a very large cut of meat), but was delicious and perfectly cooked to a medium rare as requested. The founder was great - nice crisp skin and moist flesh. Unusual to see flounder on a menu - haven't had if in years except in sushi form. The beignets were good, but the beet dessert was outstanding - very inventive, beautiful to look at and delicious as well.",4,GlennC,Chicago
"Great service, complex flavors, and overall delightful experience.  We tried the restaurant week menu for lunch, but I would go back for their lunch and wine pairing on a regular day as well.",5,JaneH,New York Area
"We had an excellent Restaurant Week lunch at Steadfast. My shrimp cocktail, salmon and coconut cheesecake were all delicious. My companion found her kale salad and beignets dessert very tasty, but thought her pork belly sandwich was just a bit too fatty. The accompanying French fries, however, were outstanding.",4,great2eatout,Chicago
"We had dinner before going to the Opera, the food and service were terrific. They veal neck gnocchi and pork chop were fantastic.",4,TAO4,Chicago
"Ours was delicious, especially the duck",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Fantastic service.,5,Jason,Indiana
Delicious food! Loved the lobster bisque &amp; bread plates the best. Fish was prepared really well. Everything was so pretty too as it came out! Definitely perfect for a celebration. But we also saw people there for happy hour which seemed like it could work for an after work hangout too.,5,jess,Chicago
Service was superior. Wonderful dining experience. Variety of food options. Very knowledgeable servers. Great overall experience.,5,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
"Wonderful lunch, great food, great host, great wait staff! I will return sooner rather than later hopefully!",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"The food was good but not great. The service was outstanding. We had to get out at a specific time and the servers made sure that happened. We never felt rushed just well taken care of. We had three course. The appetizers were great (pork belly and brioche), the entrees we ok (Salmon &amp; scallops) and the dessert was also ok (pistachio &amp; honey) but a very small portion size.",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
The service was incredibly slow. It took 45 minutes for our meal to arrive. The meal wasn’t great. We won’t go back.,2,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Service was quite slow - especially as we were there for a business lunch.  Took well over 30 minutes for food to arrive.  Portions very small, especially given the high prices.  And, really - $4.50 for an iced tea??  Disappointed overall.",3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"While staying at the Kimpton Gray we ate at Steadfast pre-Theater and, we liked it so much, we went back for breakfast the next day.   The menu was very creative and we ended up sharing a number of small plates and appetizers.  Our waiter Corin was fabulous.  The Amuse-Bouche was a delight for our eyes and taste buds.   My tip - get to the Steadfast before it becomes the cities toughest reservation.",5,OpenTable Diner,Indiana
"Had a business lunch there.  Volume was probably a little too loud to have a business conversation.  I have also been there for lunch with friends.  The noise level is better suited for a casual conversation than a business one.  Food was very good.  I have had the BLT and the Brussels Sprouts salad.  I would recommend both, especially the Brussels Sprouts salad.",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Weird and very limited menu, meh service, disinterested waitress, super loud patrons.  But at least it had good ambiance and very high prices.",3,Traveler,Las Vegas
Excellent food always - try the new chef's tasting menu. Seven generously portioned courses for $115. The dry-aged duck is a great dish to share with a group.,5,Amber,Chicago
"My boyfriend and I dined at Steadfast for NYE 2017. We were looking for a place with great ambiance and a remarkable menu offering, and Steadfast totally delivered. Deciding to go with the chef's selected five-course tasting (a standing option on their menu, with a seven-course route, too), we were absolutely dazzled by the finely crafted dishes presented to us and satisfied by the spectacular quality of the ingredients. Our server was friendly, knowledgeable, and courteous to our requests, and we were checked on by the manager more than once. In addition to the five courses we ordered (roasted beet app., lobster bisque, seared scallop w/ wild mushrooms, filet mignon,  and pistachio strudel), the kitchen and bakery sent us three complementary tastings -- a curry-coconut meringue to open the meal, a small sweet-cream topped with caramel corn after the filet, and a selection of five petit fours after the main dessert. Everything about the presentation and delivery was designed to stimulate the senses and offer a truly unique dining experience. There was a complimentary glass of champagne at midnight, and if you returned to have brunch with them on Jan. 1st, they applied a 20% friends and family discount to your receipt.",5,CatDempse,Chicago
Steadfast offered great presentation and great flavor.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"The service and food at Steadfast were phenomenal. Although we were not daring enough to try the Chef's Choice five-course meal, we did partake in the Chef's Choice bread basket. All of the breads and accouterments were fantastic! The filet that I order was cooked to perfection and accompanied by potatoes cooked three ways, as well as caramelized carrots. For dessert we took the pumpkin cheesecake to-go and I appreciated that our waiter was so concerned that the presentation of the dessert would change in a to-go container. Presented well or not, the cheesecake was amazing! Our post-show New Years Eve dinner was far better than I anticipated. Although the menu was slightly pricier than this suburban girl is used to, the atmosphere, servers, and food were well worth the cost! I would highly recommend this restaurant to people looking for a fancy night out with your significant other!",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Outstanding and attentive service with an incredible meal. The dessert program at Steadfast is something to come for alone. Great wine list and delicious food. Never disappointed here!,5,Jules,Chicago
Great place for lunch in the loop. Lots of options in the menu and have been there a few times and service is good!,5,Vicki,Chicago
The dinner was exquisite! The bread was so fresh and the accompanying butter and pickled set were so different and delicious. Must order the lobster bisque! The dessert came with a palette cleanser and petite fours afterwards. Each was elegantly crafted and quite unexpected. Service was quick and informative. Will definitely come again,5,Dina,Chicago
"The restaurant was absolutely amazing! We loved everything from the friendly host, our awesome waiter and right down to the last crumb of everything that we ate! The halibut was possibly the best prepared fish I have ever eaten! The drinks were delicious and not watered down at all like some places serve. Can’t say enough about how much we loved it!",5,OpenTable Diner,Tampa
"The atmosphere was quite nice and the staff was very attentive.  The reason I only gave it 2 stars is because the menu was too limited for my taste.  The only salad option was a beet salad the night that I went there.  I asked about a salad with greens and was told one was not available.  My girlfriend wanted a light (light in calorie) beer, and we were told they don't have light beer.  That's it.",2,OpenTable Diner,New England
"even though the menu seems to be limited, what they have to offer is spectacular. My wife and i shared the whole roasted duck and it came out perfect. The chef and waiter were conscience of our show  timing and were able to serve when they said they could. I saw a the fillet steak at the table next to me and i do plan to return as the steak looked perfect. a hot red center with little to no char. the bar has an extensive top shelf selection.",5,rical,Chicago
"+Menu selection was great, food was delicious, and waiter was knowledgeable about the entirety of the menu -- food, wine and cocktails.  Food arrived from kitchen orderly and timely. -Overall service could have been a 5 but sections for servers seemed too large or they were understaffed.  When the place became busy, we had trouble getting our server's (or anyone's) attention.  Also, even when it wasn't crowded, bar drinks took exceptionally long (even a glass of wine).",4,djt69,Las Vegas
"A very nice, upscale restaurant for a business lunch or larger party.  Food takes longer than one would expect, as we waited a good 40 minutes for BLT sandwiches.  They do not seem to be in a rush considering the restaurant is in the heart of the loop district.  Nonetheless delicious food and a nice lunch experience.",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Great food , the bread and desserts were amazing too and everything was flavorful.  Great service too",5,JellyBean,Chicago
"Good food, decent wine and beer list, strong service. Easy to recommend this as a good location restaurant, even at this price point",5,F1Rumors,Chicago
"A friend and I had a 12pm lunch reservation and were seated right away. I told the waiter that I needed to get back to work for a 1 p.m. meeting. He assured me that that would not be a problem, took our order and...I think the kitchen forgot about it. 40 minutes passed with no food and finally I had to ask to get our lunch to go. There is little sadder than sitting at your desk eating a reheated $22 sandwich and fries after you've had to sit through a meeting practically famished because the restaurant forgot to make your food in a timely matter. I may go back to Steadfast, as the food is delicious and the ambiance is lovely, but I will only go with friends, certainly not business clients. And I won't go if I'm in a hurry. Having your food go missing when you specifically asked to have it in a reasonable time frame is a one-strike-and-you're-out offense for me.  Very disappointing!",3,JennyS,Chicago
Service was personable and not at all intrusive.   Food was excellent as always.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Lukewarm coffee at weekend brunch should not have happened but it did.,4,MarilynW,Louisville
One of the best and most unique menus in Chicago,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The reviews I had read were all over the place, so our expectations weren't overly high, but we were staying in the hotel and it was convenient for pre-theater.  We ordered the tasting menu, along with the wine pairing (same price as the dinner).  The 1st course, a beet salad, was tiny but tasty, and paired well with a sparkling blush wine.   I wasn't impressed with the 2nd course lobster bisque - it was a bit salty and had an excess of sour citrus overtones along with a hint of a slightly burnt taste.  However, the well-paired chardonnay helped soften the taste of the soup.  I was loving the wine pairings, but not thrilled with the food up to this point, but that's when things started looking up.  The sea scallop course (one large scallop) was both a taste and texture explosion and again was perfectly paired with a lovely French pouilly fume.  The fillet ""main course"" (half of a generously sized fillet which had been perfectly cooked to a warm centered bright red medium rare and then cut in half to serve 2) was well seasoned and outstanding - and was paired with an exquisite Bordeaux-style Napa blend.  (We were so thrilled with the wine that we later searched for it online and found it to list at $125/bottle.)  By this time I was so impressed with the meal that I thought dessert would be a let-down, but their James Beard award-winning pastry chef didn't let us down!  The pistachio dessert (paired with a rather dry Reisling that complimented it well) was one of my very favorite desserts of all time - again with tons of flavor and texture dimensions!   Not only was our meal an incredible experience, the service was prompt with each course seamlessly flowing into the next as silverware, plates and glasses were cleared and replaced smoothly throughout.  We had informed our wait-staff that we were attending a play so they knew we were time-conscious, but it didn't feel rushed at all, and we finished with plenty of time to get to our show.    HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",5,RestaurantCritic,Cincinnati
"Food was disappointing. The items we wanted on menue was unavailable. Also, eatablishment changed chefs &amp; failed to update menue online. Had they done so, we wouldn't have dined here",4,OpenTable Diner,Philadelphia

"the waiter was not overly attentive.  dessert came 15 minutes after dinner plates were cleared and that was after getting up from the table and tracking down our waiter.  One guest's plate were cleared before everyone was one eating.    portion size was large, salad was good. tasting menu had many good options to pick from.  Oysters Rockefeller were excellent.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area

They tried too hard to make this place hip and the food was subpar and so was the service.,3,Kate,"Dined on February 3, 2018"
"LBT is a fun place, with friendly staff and solidly good, healthy food. We had the restaurant week lunch - great butternut squash soup, fabulous salmon, and a nice dessert. We added the olive starter on the advice of a friend -- a truly great recommendation! The many types of olives provided are served warm, which seems to lessen the ""squeakiness"" that so many find off-putting with olives. We'd go back just for the olives, but the rest of their menu looks interesting too.",4,JKChicago,Chicago
Wonderful menu!,4,Albfamily7,Chicago
We arrived on time for our reservation and were told they had no table for our party of 3 and they could push cocktail tables together or we could wait. We waited for 20 minutes. After we were actually seated we waited. We had no server until we had to ask someone after sitting for 35 minutes. Our appetizer took 30 minutes to arrive and our entrees arrived about 5 minutes after the appetizer. The food was good but the service was disastrous.,1,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Friendly greeting set the tone. Service continued to be great. So many delicious vegetarians options. Will definitely be back.,5,libra,Chicago
"Great food but the service was very slow.  We had to ask to have our first course cleared and dinner never seemed to come.  We hardly saw our waiter.  On the other hand, two of us are gluten-free and loved ordering ANYTHING we wanted.  The food was delicious.  I'll go back as it's in the neighborhood, but our waiter should have showed his face more often.",3,Bean,Chicago
"If I was asked what impressed me most about The Beet Table it would have to be the service. Our waiter was so gracious and helpful.  He was there when needed with suggestions.  I so wish I remembered his name, but all I remember is his beautiful red hair and efficiency.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"The food here is excellent. We truest loved every bite, and the mixed drinks are well balanced. It is sadly overshadowed though, by the very loud,  cacophonous, club like music.  This was at 6 o’clock on a Sunday.  We practically had to yell to hear each other across the table, and the more people that were seated the louder and worse it got. It looks like a quiet little place from outside, but it’s not.  We requested the music me turn down at one point. They said they would, but didn’t.  I probably won’t be back.",3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago

"Great food and service! The roasted cauliflower with green curry was a delicious, Whole30 compliant option for me, and the burger was a delicious, non-Whole30 compliant option for my boyfriend. ;)  There weren’t many other customers when we went on a Sunday night, and our server was prompt and attentive.   Good place :)",5,Anne,Indiana
"There is a lot to like here and a few not so great items.   First the good stuff. This is 100% gluten free. As someone who suffers from serious intolerance, it is great to go somewhere and not have to worry about what I am ordering. Even the beer is gluten free.   The location seemed okay, but I am not from Chicago, so not sure. It was well decorated and although it was basically one big room with the bar in the middle it seemed quiet and comfortable.  The staff was super nice answered all my questions and made good recommendations.   The food is mostly local farm to table which usually brings a higher quality along with it. The menu seemed good, but nothing exotic, mostly normal good stuff.   So, the thing that can improve. First is the hours, the kitchen closes at 9 and the place is a ghost town at 9:30.   Also the higher quality foods from the farm was not that evident given the cooking and preparation was very conventional and not healthy cooking practices. The burger was fried not broiled and they put it on an udi bun which probably makes you sicker than a gluten bun.   I really liked the place and hope they can improve some of their practices. This place has great potential. As it is it really should be a 3.5 star review.",4,GlutenFreeFoodie,Washington DC
The menu is totally gluten free which is amazing in and of itself.  And on the brunch menu they have french toast!  It is a vegetable centric restaurant and we had a great crudite and dip to start and a beet and chickpea burger that was delicious.  Great way to eat out and still feel healthy.,5,jc123,Chicago

"<strong>RESTAURANT WEEK</strong>   I think it is important to note that I went during RW 2018 and had that menu. For a $22 prix fixe lunch,  with 3 courses, the value couldnt be beat. I had the winter salad (great!), the King Salmon (PHENOMENAL!!!) and the Budino (tasty!). Holly, my waitress, was attentive and offered great suggestions.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Phenomenal food, great menu",5,AubreyL,Chicago
Soup was good and dessert was impeccable but the short rib cannelloni was bad enough to merit the meal a one star - pasta was raw and the short rib filling was just that - a filler - i had a great experience during last year’s restaurant week with the main course braised short rib or was it veal cheek a winner - worth coming back - not the case this year.,3,ArthurD,Chicago
"So we arrived for an 8pm Rez, decided to have a few cocktails with one of the best bartenders in the city: Clarence. After a few Martooooonis we took our seats. It was close to 9 and the place had 3 tables occupied. The busboy immediately came over and said the kitchen closes in 15 minutes. Ok cool, not exactly a warm greeting but I get it, they want to go home. After about 5 minutes the waitress walks over and the first thing out of her mouth was the kitchen closes in 5 minutes...wtf? Why seat us if you’re going to rush us? After we hurriedly ordered that was the last we saw of her....she obviously went home. Look, Fred’s is a pricey fine dining spot in an expensive department store. Don’t push me out the frikkin door. Whoever is the GM of this place needs to go back to his job as a doorman at an Olive Garden....",2,Lawrence38,Chicago
"A group of 5 of us came for Restaurant Week on a Wednesday night.  There were only 2 other tables of people in the entire restaurant!  It was so bizarre.  With such few tables of people, I would have expected our service to be 100%, top notch, but sadly it was not.  Our waters were always filled and our plates were always quickly taken away.  However, everything else in between was slow.  Everyone was friendly and polite.  During RW, you were able to chose two starters and both of mine were wonderful.  I ordered the ahi tuna and the cauliflower gnocchi which were amazing!  For my entree I ordered the rib and it was just okay.  My friends had the salmon and the chicken ravs, which were both much better than my short ribs.  Dessert was also wonderful.  Their Malbec, by the glass was so good that I had two glasses.   I still cannot get over how this place only had 3 tables of guests.  It is so bizarre to me.  While the good was above average, the service and ambiance was below average, especially for a nice upscale restaurant inside of Barney's.",3,Morgan,Pittsburgh
"The setting is lovely.  I wish the food could match.  My friend and I each had salads--one was a nicoise and one was topped with salmon.  The amount of greens was overwhelming and the dressing was tasteless.  The service was lackadaisical at best and we had to flag down the server for coffee.  While the salads were a bit pricey, the coffee was $5.00 per cup and we found that to be totally  overpriced compared to other lovely restaurants in the area.  There are better choices all around.",3,sibyl,Chicago
3 of us. Service was fine but each meal was mediocre at best.  Unlikely to return,2,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"We had a reservation at 7:30 pm on a Saturday night and we were the only people in the entire restaurant.  Not a good sign.  Our Caesar salad tasted off, like it was old.  Not good.  Our entree was delicious.  We were visiting from out of town and this was our last dinner in the city, sad it wasn't a better experience.",2,gavlindsearl,Chicago
"Went with some girlfriends for my birthday and we were very underwhelmed with the food. The ambiance was nice, the wine delicious ... but the food was just ok.",3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago

"Great food and service. Quiet, and love the fireplace. Will be back!",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
This is Fred’s of Chicago fur sure...not NY. Upon arrival the hostess who was training someone was unwelcoming. Our server was very nice and accommodating. We ordered fries to start. I ordered the chicken. My husband ordered the burger. The waiter kindly returned to ask if he would like vegetables or something else since the burger comes with fries. He substituted broccoli. When the food came out the burger had fries not broccoli. We told him it was okay and not to bother. Halfway through the meal the broccoli arrived. Good attempt but too late. All in all the food was delicious. If your going for anything other than that it’s blah. I’ve eaten at the original Barney’s of NY. This was mediocre compared to that.,3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Great food and great service. Loved the ambiance and the location. Can't wait to sit on their patio in the warmer months.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago

"Everything was excellent. The only reason everything wasn’t a five-star was that the manager cleared our plates before we had finished, and forced the server to dropped the check off prematurely-effectively telling us to leave. To be fair the restaurant had closed 15min prior, but her approach was still incredibly rude. John was the only highlight of exceptional service.",3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago

"This is a great spot for anyone who likes well-prepared, adventurous, healthy, tasty, and gluten-free dishes!  Especially if you have celiac disease or a gluten sensitivity, they are 100% gluten free and don't allow it on the premises.  We need more restaurants like this!",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Little Beet is one of my favorites. They have wonderful veggie forward dishes as well as plenty of options for the meat eaters out there. The food is thoughtful and sourced responsibly. My wife and I recently did Whole 30 and they were one of the few restaurants we found that were truly accommodating and left us feeling full and happy. I always look forward to dinner when Little Beet is the spot.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"My wife and I went two nights in a row because we liked the Little Beet Table so much.  There were so many creative things on the menu, we couldn't decide between them and had to go back the next night to try something else.  The manager noticed we were back and told us our dessert was on the house - he recommended a few items, emphasizing the brownies - so we ordered them and we both agreed they were the best brownies we had ever tasted.",5,OpenTable Diner,Salt Lake City
"It was unfortunate that the server waited until we asked about meat before he told us there'd been a refrigeration malfunction of some kind and there wasn't any grass fed beef to be had, or most of the other meat products too.  I'd never been, but the Little Beet Table came highly recommended from a friend who is 100% gluten free -- The Little Beet Table is also 100% gluten free ... but I assured my out of town guests from meat eating states that the LBT would have something to satisfy them.  Once we got that out of the way, everything was EXCELLENT! The waiter was attentive and kind and not afraid to give his opinion on the menu! The food was outstanding, and beautifully presented. The location was perfect. The decor was simple and comfortable -- I LOVED the fact that they had sturdy wooden chairs.  I'll definitely recommend them. And will try them again.",3,tucci,Chicago

Completely gluten free restaurant with good selection of vegetarian and vegan options. The watercress guacamole was delicious. The cauliflower steak was interesting though the curry sauce could have used more character; it was a bit bland to my palate. The Brussels sprouts were outstanding. Service was attentive and knowledgeable about ingredients. Typical big city prices make it not so much a value but it was a very good meal,4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Presentation was terrible. Taste was mediocre. All 3 of us spoke the next day and had stomach aches. The waiter could not have been more bored serving us. Terrible.,3,MDMT,Chicago
The Friday after Thanksgiving Barney’s decided to offer a buffet rather than their usual lunch menu. It was very disappointing as the food was below average and the service dismal. We had to keep requesting that our used dinner plates be removed and coffee refilled. Very disappointing! The charge was $45.00 per person ... a total rip off!,2,Pietro,Chicago
"I have been to Fred's several times and always enjoyed the ambiance and food. This last time I went for lunch the food was very disapointing. My sister in law and I both ordered the burger because my daughter got it the time before when I went with her and it was fabulous! This time it was like a completely different chef or something. It was a very average, ok burger. The bun was very boring, the lettuce was wilty and it just didn't have a lot of flavor. My other friend got the turkey club which she said was ok. It didn't look very good - seemed dry and just average. It's a bummer because I raved about Fred's and I love the ambiance however I will be hard pressed to go back after this last experience.",3,luncher,Chicago
"I really hate saying this because I love the location, love the environment and the service is really quite good. But the food needs some attention. Beautiful but no good. How can so many wonderful ingredients be combined on one plate and have little to no flavor? Please pay some mind to the actual taste and flavors served on the plate.",4,StreetervilleRes,Chicago
Wish fries were same as NY and Bev Hills,5,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"My wife and I decided to eat here for our anniversary, after she joined me in Chiacgo after my work obligation. Unfortunately the quality of food was extremely dissapoitning for what we paid for. The fish that I had was not great and something that I could have probably made at home and my wife’s crab cakes were fishy.  We ended up spending about $160 for this meal with (3)glasses of wine and an appetizer.   The service was prompt and attentive but the server seemed to not fully understand what the menu fully offered. Also at one time, I asked for a second glass of wine and the server proceeded to pour a small amount of the first glass that was left into the second glass. The problem was that they were two different types of red wine.  We don’t mind paying for a good meal as long the quality is there but unfortunately it was not there this time.",3,SO100,New York Area
Appetizers were good. Entrees average at best. One had to be sent back. Not much value for the price,3,RickK,Chicago
"Excellent food and attentive service in this upscale, low-key, stylish venue atop the Barney’s New York store at Rush and Oak. There were some minor lapses in communication with our waiter, but not a big deal. Very pleasant Sunday brunch with family. Steady crowd but by no means packed.",5,traveler,New England
We had a grand time. However it was raining and staff gave my umbrella to another patron and did not have an adequate solution when I was departing. I was never contacted about my lost umbrella despite leaving my contact info . Will return in future,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I was amazed to read such harsh comments here.  We've dined here multiple times with guests from NY to CA and Italy and they always want to come back next time they're in town.  The truffle fries and scallops are great with cocktails and the main courses offer everything from hearty Italian to interesting and very good salads.  The service is outstanding so do ask for Redding if you remember.   I have to admit we once had a less than stellar lunch salad experience with I believe a chicken salad with very scarce chicken, but in at least 8-10 years of dining experiences, it's a place you can count on with lovely views up Oak Street and a great sophisticated urban vibe without the intrusion of a meat market ambiance so pervasive at other area restaurants.  Plus, the noise is at a minimum so you can truly enjoy conversation.",5,fashionable,Chicago

"What a shame, to have a beautiful restaurant, but terrible food.  They don’t know how to cook salmon.",2,ChiFD,Chicago
"We went for lunch. I had the salmon--it was a solid okay--and my wife had the turkey club--she was unimpressed. We started with the caesar salad. It was fine but not nearly as good as the one I'd had the previous evening at at a nearby five-star hotel. The beverages were fine--wine at proper temperatures. Looking back, the menu seemed a little limited. The server was reasonably attentive but could shave been more cordial. Not bad, but there are better lunch options nearby.",3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Food was great. Service was wonderful. Ambiance was perfect. Will definitely go back.,5,Allie,Chicago
Very disappointed. It’s hard to get a chopped salad wrong but was not even chopped. Shredded chicken on top of an all together flavorless mess. Service and atmosphere are the only things going for this eating establishment.,2,Chichi,New York Area
food average and way over priced.  Service was just ok.,2,Jwg2,Chicago
"Terrible value for food - and mediocre food. My salad was poached shredded chicken, avocado mesclun greens (as if from out of a bag - not gorgeous fresh lettuce) and a few cherry tomatoes for $27?? Go to any of the other restaurants in the neighborhood to spend as much with better food. We did sit on their rooftop terrace which was lovely.",2,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Absolutely incredible dinner and service!  Husband had dry aged NY strip, and I had fillet and crab cake.  Pure crab, no fillers.  Fantastic! Cheesecake was like no other.

"We had a 8:45 reservation. We waited about an hour before we were seated. The restaurant was very busy, the waiter was good,but dinner service was very slow. I would like to attend again ( not during restaurant week and  experience regular service .",3,NickeyNicole10,Dined 7 days ago
"Had a reservation for 8:15 and promptly arrived at 8:10 . Upon arrival, we were told that our table was being cleaned and we would be seated shortly.  After waiting for 20 minutes and seeing many other parties of 4 seated, we checked again with the hostess at 8:30.  This time we were then told we were next on the list (so apparently we were either lied to or our table was given to another party after cleaning).  At 8:43 we checked back with the hostess who again told us our table was being cleaned.  We were finally seated at 8:50, well after reservation time with little apology offered.  Also, we spotted several other empty tables that sat 4-6 people which makes the fact that we waited 35 minutes after our reservation much worse. It then was another 10 minutes (9:00 pm) until a waitress even made it to our table.  Needless to say, we were not pleased with the service to that point.  Thankfully, the waitress that did come to our table was amazing (helpful, polite, and personable) and made the experience much better from that point forward.  Food was great but had to take a full two stars off for the terrible service/communication from the hostess before the meal started.",3,AndrewD,Dined 7 days ago

"Del Frisco’s is a Charm....  This is the land of friendly, attentive and chic. And you don’t have to be a steak lover to love this place. The Cake delish! Char Octopus delish! Champagne selection very good! When I commented about the temperature of my lobster bisque the Manager was already aware and apologized. When I laughed to Joey (our server) that my 2nd glass of Brut Rose from Alsace, France appears that someone has helped themselves to some on the way to our table, he fixed it royally. By the way my Beau joked I was being petty and I almost fell out of my chair in laughter.  This place is fabulous! Oh, did I mention the Champagne Room!?! No exaggeration, recently completed One Million Dollar Champagne Room.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago

"Superb! Dined here 3 times already and stopped by several times for a happy hour. Lobster mac n cheese is to die for, and the steak is just perfect. Craft cocktails contain clever combination of flavors and are not watered down in the least.  Staff is well mannered and trained.  I am a patron for life.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
I dined here before and than my steak was the best I had ever eaten.  This time around it was just good. Nothing special.  The only thing I can attribute it is the fact that I visited Del Frisco’s  during restaurant week. It was still a good meal and value but not phenomenal as it was before.,4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago

"We were looking for a real steak and the steaks were realy good, perfect to the point and good taste. What bothered a little bit was that the hugh place (three floors) was nearly empty at a prime time Friday evening. Altough crowed places can be sometimes anoying as well we felt it to be too empty. The atmosphere of these place lives by other people being there as well. Those places are not pretty when empty. Sorry, but altough the steak was great we will visit anonther place next time.",4,Philred,San Francisco
"De’eric you’re a great server very intelligent, very attentive, knew your menu and had recommendations thank you for your kind service.... Unfortunately the food didn’t stand up to the service in any way shape or form, we started with the crab cake and the Lobster bisque....... Crab cake a strong C letter grade (slightly overlooked) even though she enjoyed it.the Lobster Bisque was overly salty and we didn’t something we’ve never done and sent it back to the kitchen....... We decided on the Waygu ribeye (tomahawk) 32 oz. is massive so we decided to share... To my companion who is a steak lover she thought it was slightly too salty, while I disagreed on her opinion of it being too salty for it to be Waygu it just wasn’t as flavorful as other Waygu I’ve consumed in the past at a steakhouse the steak should really standout and it was a total miss..... The sides we had the lobster Mac and cheese and even though it had lobster it was very meh, the brussels sprouts weren’t very tasty either...... We decided on Del Frisco at the last minute and I wish we would have put more time into our thoughts.......",2,MeOhMe,Chicago

After returning both items our food didn’t come while all our other friends finished their food. The manager came and assured us she will fix it and we asked her to refill our sodas she said she will have someone bring them but that never happened. We asked again after 10 mins to the same manager again she said the waitress will bring it. But didn’t do it herself. We asked for a sauce three times and it didn’t come until after we were done eating. Overall experience was terrible with the service.",3,Faizashahid23,"Dined on February 3, 2018"

The hostess was quick and kind, but the server kinda left us alone (too much so). I would have ordered another drink had she come by our table, but by the time she did, we were basically done with our food. She left the check and then didn't come back to pick it up. Twenty minutes later my friend got up from the table and found the server to pay.",4,opentable94,Chicago

"We were seated about 5 minutes after arrival for our reservation, however weren't seen by a waiter for a long time. Maybe 20 minutes with no contact whatsoever and we had to ask the hostess for a waiter as we hadn't even gotten water or a greeting.  The manager did come by after and apologize along with comping our first round of drinks and our appetizer which was nice.  About half the table really liked the food, and half were underwhelmed.  On the steak and shrimp plate, the green beans (add salt) and potatoes were the best pieces. Shrimp was a generous helping but seemed just heated up and was barely seasoned. Steak was cooked perfectly but could have been seasoned better also.  Others enjoyed the California burger and Bibimbop very much and would recommend. Overall great ambiance, but unfortunately we didn't get good service that night even though they made up for it.  Would try it again but probably as a last chance and due to convenience of location.",3,onadate,Chicago
"This restaurant has okay food but is probably the best at New City mall where the ArcLight theatre is located.  The hostesses were not very organized but the rest of the staff provided great service.  I was with two friends and none of us really loved our meals; they were okay but definitely nothing to write home about.  It was also a bit pricey for what we got.  The restaurant is huge and can accommodate a lot of people which is a good thing, especially on a Saturday night.",3,CSSchicago,Chicago

Great interior design as well and located next to movie theater. We had late dinner and then seen a movie right after.",4,Anthony,Chicago
"When Earl's first opened it was fabulous, our last two experiences were average.  2 weeks ago before a movie we sat at the bar, we asked for our appetizer first and then our main course, within 2 to 5 minutes of our appetizer arriving our food came and the fries which were to be Truffle were not and already cold upon arrival.  This last Friday, we went with friends before the theatre, service was ok, I ordered a California burger which should have had avocado and extra mushrooms with a salad.  when served the person delivering the food had no idea whose food was whose, no mushrooms, no avocado, manager is now serving us.  She brings uncooked mushrooms assuming they're for my salad, no lemon which was ordered for my salad, by they time I got the extras ordered I had eaten most of my burger and we needed to leave for the movies.  I'm very sad that a place that was go wonderful when it opened has failed to provide warm food and good service to us within two visits in two week.",2,Resortgirl,Chicago

Great customer service and food! They had to call us earlier in the day to let us know they were closing last minute for the rest of the evening due to a maintenance issue - we were bummed because it was a special occasion.

Our out-of-town guests were so happy with our restaurant choice. Great team at Earl's! Thank you!,5,Jake,Chicago

In fact there was COLD air blowing on us, we asked them to at a minimum turn it off since what was blowing was cold air, but they said they couldn't.   Very uncomfortable, and we couldn't just leave as we needed to make a movie so didn't have the time.   It would have been helpful if they had told us before seating us.",2,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Food was nothing special. Bar food.,2,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
We were sat at a table in the bar even though we had a reservation. It was right by a door to an outdoor area with heaters and fireplaces.

They brought us s blanket! Ridiculous to eat like this!,2,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"After telling me ‘reservations’ don’t matter(I set one up on opentable) they sat us.

Ordered drinks(bottomless mimosas) after 10 more minutes I flagged down the same server (who I guess wasn’t the server in our section) he took our food order. Still no drinks delivered. 10 more minutes pass and our food arrives. Chicken and waffles were cold. Mid way through eating I flagged down the same server to ask were our drinks were. Defeated The whole purpose of bottomless mimosa. I finish my food before our first drink came out. The server for our section didn’t come to our table once. Then to top it off, my GF found a hair in her salad. So in short, HARD PASS ON EARLS.",1,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
We had a party of 10 for my birthday. They put together 4 huge 4-top tables together with 2 people across from each other at each table. Everyone was SO far apart. No one could talk to each other or hear each other talk. The service was absolutely terrible too. They messed up drinks for half the table and there was no bus boys so the food was never cleared. And it took forever.,3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Aside from our food taking FOREVER to get out and not getting our appetizer prior to the meal (someone messed up and delivered it to another table) everything was delicious and wonderful. The other mistake made was my side salad came out as a full salad but I guess I can't complain there ;),4,OpenTable Diner,Denver
"Granted it was a late afternoon lunch, so it was quiet. But, we were treated like royalty! My obnoxiously fickle guests were indulged and accommodated: ordered wine, sent it back, tasted 3 different other wine samples, declined them all then ordered ginger ale!  Our server,  patient and resilient beyond her years, made us feel right at home.  The items I enjoyed: jerk chicken wings, poke and swordfish tacos were nicely seasoned and well presented. I didn’t have any of the BBQ ribs, but one guest inhaled her ribs, tendered no offers for sampling and said, “That was good!” My wife, a vegan, really enjoyed her mushroom soup.  Overall, it’s a good place for a nice meal. There’s 2 hours of free validated parking in the underground parking lot to boot.",4,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
"Abnormally loud DJ for a restaurant. Made conversation difficult. Waitress was also the bartender so service was slow.  One guest needed to keep asking for one of everything, water, flatware, napkin, even though we’d made the reso for six.

Overall the restaurant is very nice and food very good.  My one suggestion is that the hostess needs to be welcoming and knowledgeable.

"Everything we had was delicious! The roast chicken with chicken sausage under the skin was amazing - fed three of us (and we are good eaters). The waitress recommended smoked beet tartare  - and it was amazing. Also the vegetable sides. In fact, everything was not the usual and provided unexpected pleaures. Service was attentive and friendly.  The restaurant is named for Somerset Maugham in honor of his Razor's Edge hero who returns to Chicago after WW I before moving to Paris. Maybe he would have stayed in Chicago if he could have eaten at Somerset!",5,fairview,Chicago

"This was my second visit to Somerset. The first time the food was great as was the service. Not sure what happened but my second visit seemed to be at a totally different restaurant. My biggest complaint was that our server was HORRIBLE! His name was Michael and he was incredibly pretentious. Kept walking around the restaurant with an air about him like he was the owner of the place not the waiter. We were seated, he handed us our menus, we placed a drink order, then we didn't see him again for 30 minutes. We sat there sipping our water wondering where our drinks were. Waiting 30 minutes for a drink order is incredibly unacceptable. I wish that was the end of our bad service. He kept walking around the restaurant back and forth not really doing anything, then came back and took our appetizer orders. Knowing how long our last drink order took, I then ordered another drink. after 15 minutes, I asked him where my drink was and he replied I didn't know you had ordered a drink, I thought you were complimenting me on how good the drink was. I watched as the bartender made my martini and put it off to the side. Again our waiter was just walking about, after 15 minutes I again asked him where my drink was, he went to the bar, grabbed the martini, brought it over and lied to me that the bartender had just made it, and I told the waiter I knew he lied. He just laughed it off. So twice I waited 30 minutes for a drink order, thankfully he does not bring out the food because I probably wouldn't have gotten it.   Sadly, the food on our second visit was not very good either. I ordered the same dish I had ordered the first time. A squid ink pasta with shrimp and calamari. My dish had 2 shrimp and 4 calamari rings in it (yes I counted). For a dish that was $28 it should had more than 2 shrimp. Also my wife had a short rib that and while she enjoyed the flavor, it was very tough.   I enjoyed this restaurant very much our first visit, what happened to this restaurant?",1,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"The wait staff, while amiable, repeatedly failed to get the right plates to the right people in our party and missed altogether the squid ink pasta. Removing that item from the bill was a nice gesture. The squid ink pasta then was a disappointment as was the Spanish octopus. Where was the octopus? Smoked beet tartare was the best appetizer by far. The beef tartare had mayonnaise. Not good. Venison loin was excellent as was the chicken although much hotter would make it much better.   Communication among the staff and better management is key here. No need to come back. Been there. Done that.",3,stevesrisk,Chicago
"This place was super cute inside, such a cool vibe with navy and gold decor that I loved. We did have to wait about 10-15 min past our reservation for a table at brunch but our server was very friendly and knowledgeable and we really enjoyed our food! The Madagascar latte was very yummy and I loved my breakfast sandwich with the turkey sausage. My boyfriend got the baked eggs which was also yummy. A little pricy for brunch but somewhat expected for a trendy Chicago spot. Would definitely recommend!",5,OpenTable Diner,Nashville
"Great food and service, terrible crowd. The next generation of Viagra triangle residents.",3,OpenTable Diner,St. Louis
"We had really high hopes for this place after seeing great things written about it. To be honest, our food was overly salted and cold, we waited a while to be seated even though we had reservations and felt rushed by the service. We chose this place to to celebrate an engagement dinner with a few close friends and were sad the experience didn't live up to the hype. Maybe we were just unlucky, as I know restaurants have bad nights, but unfortunately we did not experience it at all how we read about it.",2,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"Contemporary feel, with good service and very good food, but a bit too expensive overall.",3,thomask,Chicago
Every course at our table was outstanding.  Wait staff was knowledgeable and friendly.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago

"Excellent service, phenomenal food, 5 stars all around",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Food was very good - service a bit confused but pleasant,4,JohnG,Chicago
"The service was attentive and friendly.  Lunch menu was rather ordinary, but we chose the soup and sandwich.  It stood out because it was not the ordinary fare.  The soup was excellent.  The smoked fish open-faced sandwich was really tasty, and certainly not found in many restaurants. The dessert of coconut and lime sorbet was different.  The texture was more like ice cream than sorbet. Would definitely return for another meal. Only complaint is the noise.  Place was not full but the noise level was high.",4,Zoey,Chicago
Wonderful meal.  Good service and wide range of tastes.  Unique preparation of common menu items (Brussels sprouts and beer salad) makes them stand out.  Short rib entree and burger both fantastic.,5,DMoney,Chicago
"Great new location (3 storey building) , beautiful interior design, great food but a bit expensive.",4,Letti,Chicago
Great ambience coupled with top level service rounded out a spectacular meal. It lived up to the recommendation we were given. Roof top bar for a night cap is a must.,5,OpenTable Diner,Las Vegas

"Beautiful space and lively bar scene. The food was good, in particular the beets are phenomenal and make Somerset worth a visit. The service was okay, nothing standout.",4,e2sc,New York Area
"Have eaten here for lunch and dinner 6 times.  This was first brunch experience.  Lunch and dinner menu and food are fantastic.  Brunch was quite disappointing.  Menu was mainly breakfast items which at noon, is not what we wanted to eat.  Brunch menu is served on weekends only and until 4.  Preparation of brunch items was ho-hum which is in sharp contrast to the wonderfully prepared and interesting lunch and dinner items.  We felt as if we were in a completely different restaurant from the one we have eaten in for lunch and dinner.  Servers were less experienced than lunch/dinner servers.  We had to ask for basics like butter and jam for toast.  The restaurant makes all of it’s own breads so the English muffin and brioche were exceptionally yummy.",3,Embe,Chicago
"Outstanding on all fronts. We were celebrating an anniversary and everyone from the hosts, to our server, to the manager, congratulated us (multiple times). Our server took exceptional care of us. Complimentary champagne and house-made truffles opened and closed our meal. Shared dishes were split in advance and plated beautifully (plentiful portions, by the way!). I could eat the sunchoke soup every day, and really anything with sunchokes on the menu is incredible. Masterful octopus preparation, mouth watering venison, creative desserts (banana chocolate tart and bourbon ice cream!) with great variation in texture.",5,sofiadujour,Chicago
"Super pretentious and expensive restaurant with more staff than customers dining.  The ambience was lovely but the food was marginal at best and way overpriced. However, the staff were very attentive and the cocktails were delicious even if they were served in child size glasses.",1,TL1947,Chicago

Strange food combinations and weird flavors with a limited menu.  Salmon and Chicken seemed to be under cooked.  Ambiance is nice in the front space with lots of windows and cozy booth space.  Back dining area is a little strange with large booths for table of 6.,1,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Outstanding from beginning to end.,5,eagervoyager,Chicago

I decided that my parents needed to experience a different brunch spot in Chicago. When we walked in my dad immediately loved the decor. Once we received our food everyone agreed that this food was spectacular with huge portions!! Needless to say we will be back.,5,OpenTable Diner,Washington DC
"Get pancakes, forget everything else.",2,Vincenzo,Chicago
We took a group to the Hash House A Go Go and had a wonderful brunch. The staff was friendly and helpful. We enjoyed a variety of unique food items but the Chicken and Waffles were a hit and what we originally came for. So much food that we left with a to go bag . I was able to find some healthy and lighter options. The bloody Mary's with the bacon were wonderful and would go back just for the drinks. Some in our group had visited the restaurant in Las Vegas and both locations were great and highly recommended.,5,LoriT,Seattle
"This was my first time going to the location in Chicago after loving the one in LV. I must say our server was a pleasure as she was always checking up on us and had a great attitude. The food was amazing as well, even though the prices seem higher, you get a lot of food so it’s totally worth it. The only thing that sucks is the parking, since it’s downtown you gotta use spot hero.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Surrounding area offers MANY more much better options. Ordered a Tito's cocktail..... ""we don't carry that but we have 'Deep Eddy'....... it's made by the same company"". Never lie to someone in the industry.",3,michaelriesenbeck,Chicago
"You get plenty of food and came quick , the service was great I will be back .",5,thedrc65,Chicago
The food is way too much &amp; the presentation is just gross. No one can actually eat that much food at one sitting . Way too much sauce on the salmon Benedict with very little salmon. Lots of mashed potatoes &amp; huge biscuits. Think of Fred Flintstone portions with very little flavor.,2,MissyBug,Chicago
Christmas brunch was wonderful with a salmon scramble and an adult hot chocolate.,5,intriguing,New Orleans
Food was huge and amazing. Will definitely be back. My only complaint was they didn't offer the souvenir glass that was advertised with my drink.,5,OpenTable Diner,St. Louis

"I’ve heard a lot about this place and was excited to go, the food was okay, very few vegetarian options, mimosa was flat and didn’t have much flavor. The service was great just not sure if the food was worth the price",4,TinaP,Chicago
"I ordered the BLT.  It was really good, and very big.  I only consumed half, and took the other half home.   I pulled the leftover 1/2 BLT  out of the fridge later that evening and IT GOT EVEN BETTER!  The cold leftover BLT was THE BEST sandwich I've ever eaten.",5,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco

The food was awesome! Huge portions  two people could easily eat one meal!  The staff was extremely friendly  and very attentive.  Would  go back if in town again.,5,Carrie,Indiana
Had been to Hash House in San Diego and had a great experience (food/service was great).  Wanted to try here in Chicago....unfortunately didn’t have a main entre that we wanted to order. The most disappointing aspect was the service...in particular the server. I can’t temember the last time we experienced service as poor as we had here. Really disappointed as we were really looking forward to the evening.,2,Jona,Chicago
"Food was great, however crying baby in restaurant was highly irritating.",5,TeniaJ,Chicago
"The meals are way oversized for me, hard to finish just half.",4,DeeCee,Chicago
Great food options and drinks. Love the portion sizes and drink prices. Favorite place to eat hearty and chill.,5,Dinnerwithfriends,Chicago
More chain than farm to table cuisine.  Pretty bland and the portions tried to make up in size what the food lacks in taste.,2,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Great service,5,marylynnV,Chicago
Only complaint restaurant not busy at all n server had to be called several times!  Also had reservation for six but only five showed n we were stuffed in a Booth too small n a larger booth was unoccupied our whole dining time,4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"My wife’s eggs were undercooked and the chicken on my roast chicken hash was dry and flavorless. Taste and presentation was pedestrian at best. Service was above average so that spared the meal but we will not be going back. Oh yeah, spread the tables out or make it communal dining. One or the other so patrons have clear guidelines in regards to conversational volume and content. My wife and I were so close to the table next to us that we couldn’t decide whether to join in their conversation or speak/ shout over them!",3,OpenTable Diner,St. Louis
Restaurant was nice.  Front desk person could have been friendlier but her assist was. Seated us downstairs. Service was great. Music playing was a bit loud for my taste.  Food was good and pancakes were huge. Need to share. Overall a great place to share with a larger group.,4,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"This was a nice looking restaurant, however upon entering the door, the entire placed smelled like mildew or dirty mop water.  I informed one of the staff members.  The smell was over the entire place which kind of turned my stomach.  Other members of my party mentioned the smell also to me which confirms that it was not just me smelling the unpleasant smell.  The french toast was very good, however my eggs and potatoes were not recommendable to anyone.  The potatoes tasted as if they were previously frozen and then tossed in the oven and taken out way to soon.  No one in my party was totally happy with their food . I felt responsible because it was my husband's birthday and I invited his family.  I can not recommend this restaurant to anyone because it was not a very good eating experience.  The customer service was very good.",2,Shon,Chicago
"Just an OK experience. I think this place is trying so hard to be cute that the actual food suffers. The food is average and doesn't stand out, There are plenty of places with better food and prices.",2,DowntownDiner,Chicago

The menu listing is not accurate for this location.  Very few non-breakfast options  But food is excellent.,3,DonFromHP,Chicago
"Hostesses were rude. Not a good place to go if you are gluten free.  I asked for my order to be made gluten free and it arrived with a huge biscuit on the plate.  I've read other reviews saying their potatoes are not gluten free, but my waitress didn't give me a straight answer about them.  Definitely got sick after I ate here.",2,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"So Happy that our friends recommended that we go here.. We were on our way to a Cubs game and staying downtown, there were several places near our hotel we could have met but some friends who live locally suggested Hash House a go go.. It was half way between Wrigley and Downtown, and easier for our friends to meet us and park. We had a great breakfast, as everyone says the portions are huge.. We took the suggestion and split but then ordered a separate french toast because it looked so good :)  My Husband had the Hash and loved it, my friend and I split the ham, eggs, spinach and cheese scramble.. with potatoes and fruit, plenty of food and delicious!!! Tryi it you will like it :)",5,Lane,Orange County
The food is very sugar salt and fat.  Very Cheesecake Factory like.  Meant to appeal to the masses.  I can get a better pancake at a diner.  Setting fun but food a miss.,3,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
"Great food, excellent service. This was my first visit, but I intent on returning soon",5,lpdining4,Chicago
Delicious is the word! Really enjoyed our meal and a lovely glass of wine. Beautiful surroundings. Excellent service.,4,Mame,Phoenix
"We were excited to dine here after we got situated for a before-dinner drink in the bar. It's a beautiful space with great views of the surrounding area. The drinks were very tasty and original. Things took a turn once we were seated in the dining area (the bar signifcantly outshines the dining space). We started with the saganaki wings (they didn't disappoint!) and the tartare (standard). For entrees we did the boar ragu (good, but not special) and the risotto (good). The restaurant has a great selection of wines by the glass--would have appreciated a sommelier for bottle rec.The big issue here was the service. Our server had at least 6 tables which is too many for a place that should be providing 5 star quality. Probably wouldn't go back.",3,tjs6677,Austin
"This was my second meal at Travelle, and it was even better second time around. I'm craving the suckling pig right now. I also really love the chicken wings...crispy with that great aioli.",5,SallieAnn,Chicago
"Took a chance on hosting a business dinner here, and was not disappointed. It's location is non-conventional: second floor of old IBM building, in association with 5-star Langham. The decor is fantastic, very modern. I can't stand restaurants with throbbing music so loud you have to shout at the person next to you to be heard - not a problem here, happy to report. Noise level was just right. Crowd size on this Wed evening was very comfortable; can't comment on weekend nights. Service issues mentioned in other reviews appear to be ironed out - we were all pleased. Meals were fine, neither extraordinary nor lackluster. The lounge and bar set good vibes. Overall a great experience - you can have fun here.",4,docmartin,Chicago
The space was beautifully designed and creates a very relaxing environment. The service was slow but attentive. We ordered an appetizer that showed up after our entrees. The food was just OK. Beautifully plated but the portions were a little lacking.,2,Beth,Chicago
"Tried this for a business lunch. Slow and quiet but not in a depressing way. The space is large, open and bright with lots of natural light. Menu is inventive, food very tasty. Service was strong, with some wrinkles to work out - for instance, multiple people would approach us and ask us the same question. Will definitely return.",4,Neighbor,San Francisco
Hopefully kinks will be worked out. Restaurant was empty but service was very slow. Server was not very knowledgable about menu options. Hotel is very pretty though,2,ChiEater,Atlanta
"Travelle offers an unexpected and beautiful view of Chicago's most exciting architecture. The fact that the interior ambience, service and food is superb adds to the experience. This is certainly a new find for the city. I enjoy seeing the expressions on my friends/clients faces as I introduce them to this gem.",5,Alec,Palm Springs
Scenic view was only from the bar area but the space was beautiful. The suckling pig and Harissa Tartar were out of this world!,4,GeoF,Chicago
"...it's new, and there are many bugs to work out. Service was slow despite few customers. Bar is very nice, high end and good cocktails. Restaurant food was well prepared but not truly notable for a 5 star hotel restaurant that us charging full freight.",3,Alwayseatsout,Chicago
"Magic stuff with appetizers and a varied Mediterranean-style menu to die for. The chef came by the table to personally light our saganaki chicken wings, which were unique and may set the standard for wings. Beautiful open kitchen and window views. Only one small beef: We were welcomed by about three servers/staff people but after we got water none of them took responsibility for our table and so it took much longer than it should have for us to order food and wine. We were famished after a day at a football game and Travelle wasn't full, so the service gets only three stars. It would be two were it not for the chef's table visit to light the wings; he got back a star. I am confident this was an accident and the service standards are high.",5,Jeff,Washington DC
"perhaps the best service I ever experienced. Every member of the staff from somalier to busboy knew yur named and greeted you by name. Food was very good. pace was unhurried. Portion sizes just right. Excellant wine list and very knowledgeable somalier. After dinner the hotel car and driver, not a taxi, took us back to our rrsidence which was about 1 mile from the hotel.",4,casceo,Chicago
"We thoroughly enjoyed our evening! Chef Tim came to our table several times to ensure our satisfaction. The wait staff were incredibly attentive and helpful. The presentation and food choice was gourmet, yet ""real"" food that ""real"" people eat. The wine list was excellent! We can't wait to return.",5,hozee,Chicago
"Travelle opened just three weeks ago. It aims to serve Mediterranean cuisine in a friendly, convivial fashion, and thus encourages sharing of dishes between guests at the same table. The food is tasty, well prepared and well presented, but will not vie for Michelin stars. The service was attentive, maybe a bit too much so. The waiter though it necessary to read us the entire menu as well as to address us as ""we"" (how are we doing tonight?) which immediately downgrades the place by several notches in my mind. The wine list was interesting, first time I see Château Musar (from Lebanon) featured in a US wine list. All in all a decent new addition iun an easily accessible location.",4,VictorJ,Chicago
My husband &amp; I went out with friends to celebrate their anniversary. The Langham Hotel is extravagant and beautiful walking in the front door. The staff is friendly and helpful; you don't have to worry about finding your way. The restaurant is modern and tastefully decorated. Our waiter was exceptional in serving us and was so knowledgeable about every item on the menu and how foods were prepared. The food was delicious and unique.  I'll return to this restaurant again and again. Travelle of Chicago is definitely Chicago's newest and finest restaurant. I can't to try the hotel!,5,Shay,Chicago
"Bar and lounge spaces are beautiful, but the dining room is a mix between a high-end diner &amp; a banquet facility. It just doesn't make sense in such an upscale setting. Being open only two weeks, they are doing a lot right with service and the quality of the food is very good. There are other hotel restaurants that are better looking and more comfortable, though.",3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"A bit pretentious - it's not Per Se after all. How do you have a menu in August with no local peaches, local tomatoes, or other fruits of the season? Flaming Chicken wings not what i would consider a ""wow."" Difficult to get through the wine menu and too many $400 bottles of wine. A red Sancerre? Not sure this is what people want in a second floor hotel restaurant. Plus, we were practically the only people there and an offering from the chef - not just the watermelon basil water- would have been a nice touch.",3,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"We have dined frequently at the Langham -Huntington restaurants in Pasadena, CA, so we naturally had high expectations for our first visit to Travelle, in the Langham Chicago. Our high expectations were far, far surpassed! The quality and preparation of the food was exquisite, and the service was attentive, personable, and professional. We had breakfasts, lunch and dinner there. Each dining experience was just superb.",5,Jeff,Washington DC
"A wonderful meal in an elegant, sleekly modern and sophisticated dining room. A great spot for a special occasion or just an indulgent evening out. The food is great (the octopus was tender and perfect -- very hard to find) but the a-la-carte prices are not as steep as you might think. The red snapper en papiollote was excellent and the za'tar carrots and romanesco with romesco sauce are not-to-be-missed sides. A couple missteps by our server didn't diminish an overall great experience.",5,LakeviewNeighbor,Chicago
"The staff falls all over themselves asking if everything is okay but the restaurant falls short itself. The acoustics are so bad that you hear every conversation in the room. Our waiter wasn't knowledgeable-when I asked what type of salmon they were serving, he didn't know. Then when I asked what a particular liquor was in one of the drinks, he made something up. We waited too long for our entrees to come out, even though there were only a handful of tables occupied in the restaurant. The food is just okay-nothing special at all. Our bill was $220 for 2 people, one glass of wine each and a shared dessert. There are plenty of good restaurants... Skip this one.",2,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"The room is lovely and the wait and wine staff were quite good. We were, however, disappointed that 2 of our four dishes did not live up to their description and were quite disappointing. I hope that this failure of execution can be attributed to the newness of the enterprise (we dined on the first evening it formally opened). We will wait a number of weeks and try it again.",3,NikE,Chicago
"Great! We went here and had the Restaurant Week lunch menu, everything was delicious !",5,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco

The drink menu was wonderful and the waitress was extremely knowledgable about the menu.  Food wise, everything was delicious and perfectly prepared.  Food  and drinks came out in just the right amount of time every time.  You won't be disappointed at all!",5,Krashtest,Chicago

Wonderful food and great service. Would recommend when you have time to enjoy your meal.,5,Bday,Chicago
"This was our second visit to Travelle during restaurant week. Amazing experience both times. Wait staff was on point-friendly and efficient. Our server comped my glass of wine, much to our surprise. Elegant understated dining room. Last but not least, the food was a revelation in restraint with artistic presentation and layers of complex flavors. My wife and I plan on returning for dinner in the near future.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Excellent service. Appreciate the creativity of the Chef for providing very tasty choices.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Paul, our server, was phenomenal! Truly had an amazing experience here.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Service needs a lot of improvement as it seems very mechanical. Servers had no whatsoever small talk with the diners! This is not North Korea. Waiters seem to be in a hurry to remove plates. No complimentary Bread &amp; Butter. Leaves a lot to be desired.,3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
One of most elegant dining rooms in Chicago with imaginative menu and attentive wait staff.,5,Hoosier,Chicago

"The entire experience was excellent, from food quality to service and attention to detail.",5,OpenTable Diner,Seattle
"Travelle was fabulous. Great ambiance.  Great lighting and acoustics.  It had a busy feeling, but at the same time it was easy to have a conversation.  I had a dish that is not on the website menu -- raw fish in a sauce that included sesame, and had jalepenos sprinkled on top.  I'm still dreaming about it.  We also had the burrata and crispy brussel sprouts -- both excellent.  My husband had the spicy chicken and loved it. Great service. Highly recommended!",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"An absolute utter disappointment for a Christmas dinner. We arrived early and sat at the bar for a drink very friendly staff, superb drink making for a good first impression. We did have to check on our reservations and the bar waitress was prompt in letting us know our table was ready. We were the second table to be seated yet as the restaurant began to fill our waiter was no where in site. When he did come his disinterest was obvious. No I did not get his name he didn't offer it, nor did he offer to let us know anything about the menu or any specials. We ordered and waited a long period of time before our food arrived watching others order after us and receiving their food. In fact our waiter didn't even bring the food to our party of two, nor did we get it all at once. Worse service ever and we decided to not stay for dessert. The food was okay nothing special and certainly not worth price for an alleged upscale restaurant",1,Vikki,New York Area
Amazing xmas day with very pro staff. Totally worth it.,4,polo22,Chicago
The brunch was spectacular.  Salmon Eggs Benedict was perfection.  Location amazing!  The only improvement would be the service which for a slow day on Christmas Eve was average.  Slow and not as attentive as I would expect for a restaurant like Travelle.,5,OpenTable Diner,Philadelphia
"Paul was amazing as usual , made us feel at home. I had the bison which was really good and my wife the branzino and thought it was wonderful.   The blackened cod may have had something off because my Dad was not feeling great afterwards but on those things it is hard to tell.  The chai cheesecake is definitely something to try , pass on the pound cake.",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
This is how dining should be.  Amazing service from the entire team!   Cocktails and meal was excellent!,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"My first experience at Travelle was quite nice.  Every staff member was very considerate and helpful. I had the Risotto, and it was a good helping and delicious.  However, if you do not like mushrooms, I would stay away from the risotto.  My La Paloma cocktail was amazing! I would come back just for that drink alone.",3,Foodie13,Chicago
"Well, I guess I'm kind of sad about this review. Truvelle could be and should be one of the finer restaurants in Chicago. It is in one of the finer hotels in Chicago. However it is frankly simply a roller coaster. It seems as if the management continues to change in both the bar and the restaurant and every regime brings with it a change in the quality. It goes up it goes down it goes up it goes down. This level of inconsistency makes it difficult to trust that you can have a good business or personal meal here and therefore makes it hard for me to see it being a successful restaurant long-term. And if it's not a successful destination restaurant it will become even more lackluster as it genericizes itself as a basic Hotel restaurant. My most recent experience there was disappointing. The food was only okay and the service was fairly poor. We had a table of 10 which usually I would give quite a bit of leeway for. However the menu was fairly pre-selected with wine that was pre-selected and the restaurant was fairly empty besides our table. So in my opinion there's no excuse for the relatively poor service.",4,ALSWharton,Chicago
My food was a bit cold but it was tasty.,3,OpenTable Diner,Milwaukee
"Excellent food , relating ambience, and great service!",5,Karin,Los Angeles
Beautiful and relaxing environment!  Top Notch service with a personal touch!  Uncompromising attention to detail from hostesses to wait staff to impeccably made 5 star dishes.  Worth stopping by the Langham for this amazing restaurant esp. at night to enjoy the stellar atmosphere.,4,Cestlavie,Las Vegas
"First time visit for Thanksgiving Day dining. This is an annual tradition and we have dined all over the city, including the Ritz- Carlton, Sixteen, NoMI for brunch/dinner/buffet.. This was a wonderful meal, and not just because of the sheer diversity of items. The offering were well laid out, allowing guests to traverse freely about the room. Accompanied by a lovely quartet, we were able to pick from breakfast foods to a tasty turkey dinner ( with a delicious Filet for those non turkey eaters) to pasta, salads, and sweets table to satisfy any sweet tooth. The children's' table was also well stocked. The wine list was manageable and we had a beautiful Burgundy to accompany our delectable meal. The setting was very comfortable, soothing, and accommodated a wide range of diners. ( We saw everything from children in sleepers, to jean clad twentysomethings to dowagers in diamonds. Everybody looked relaxed, satisfied, and happy. The service was attentive, without being obtrusive. It was once of the best Thanksgiving dinners we have had because of the total package. Can't wait to return to try their regular menu.",5,Az2008,Chicago
"All I can say is that I had an amzing evening enjoying my two favorite things, family and a perfect meal. Thank you Paul and staff for a very special experience. I will return.- M",5,OpenTable Diner,Indiana
"The hostess sat us down, but the waiter didn't come over for 15 minutes. The hostess had to take our drink order and even came back to ask us if we were ready to place our dinner order, but we weren't ready.",1,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
Nice ambiance but my food was a little on the dry side. My other guests enjoyed their meal however,4,sheens,Chicago
Excellent  breakfast meal. I won't hesitate to return  to Travellers not just for lunch and dinner but also for breakfasts.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Very good experience. They were well versed in our reservation. Thank you for a wonderful night.,4,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
"New chef in past 5 months. We shared small plates for dinner: beef tartare, Brussels sprouts, shrimp tostadas. All were delicious, creative and beautifully presented. Airy, open and contemporary environment. Bar a bit noise but restaurant, very comfortable",4,OpenTable Diner,Seattle
The Moroccan Benedict is wonderful~~ my friend and I enjoy the brunch but seems like business area.. so many people take their computers and talk about business. Not really a relax atmosphere. Waiters are nice.,4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"excellent service, clean space and well designed dishes",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Inventive food, excellent service in nice surroundings. Awkward to find as it's on the second floor of the Langhan Hotel. Worth it once you find it.",5,Martin,Minneapolis
Great food with a lovely window.  The 2oz. pour of Rose for $14 was an issue.,3,cummingfoodie,Atlanta
This is one of most beautiful restaurants overlooking the river ! Inside the spectacular The Langham Hotel! Meet Chef Anthony and special thanks for a memorable night! This could be Chicago's best kept secret ! Locals did not know of this jewel!,5,OpenTable Diner,Miami
"We were in town for a conference and decided to try Boleo. Our concierge suggested it to us and we absolutely LOVED it! Wonderful drinks, food, atmosphere, and the list could go on. We would definitely come back again. The food was a bit pricey, but well worth it. We tried almost everything on the menu and would order everything again.",5,OpenTable Diner,Atlanta
"Very hip, young crowd. Great drinks but pricey. Small tapas type menu. Very loud, especially during happy hour. Live jazz after 7.",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Just  ok. I thought it was going to be a fun hip place, but maybe too hip for a fuddy duddy from the burbs. The food and drinks were good,  but the menu was too hard to decipher, especially if you have dietary restrictions. The main thing was the service it just wasn't that good. For instance we were there early and it was maybe 30% occupied, they gave us a table in a corner,  but then 10 minutes later they put this dude right next to us.  Really???? There were at least a dozen empty tables and you put this guy next to us, so close that he could hear every last word. Also when we arrived at the table the server made special mention of the happy hour specials, but then convienently charged us full price.   So just not that impressed overall,  doubt we will be back.",2,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"At 4:30 on. Friday, it was very quiet, with just a couple groups of 30 year olds gathered for drinks.  Maybe it warms up later, but it was rather cold. The cocktails however, were very interesting, and the small plates also very tasty.",3,Marcia,Chicago
Very cool place with rooftop that opens up on nice days. Great atmosphere and good food. Yummy cocktails!,4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Great ambiance, pretty creative drinks and good food!  Interesting variety menu.",5,montanheiroadriana0000000,Chicago
The service was really outstanding! The space is incredible and food was delicious. A great place to meet with a large group of friends.,5,OpenTable Diner,Los Angeles
This is a bar that serves food.   An awesome bar.....service was a cocktail waitress not a food waitress.   We went out for a pizza after several small plates.....  Great place to hookup or just party with friends...but not a place to have dinner.,4,Dylandog12,Key West
"Thoroughly disappointed!  We had reservations and were seated at a table in the bar - then proceeded to sit there for 25 minutes without anyone taking our order.  We ended up walking out and going elsewhere. A busboy did come and fill our water glasses (twice) and promised that a server would be over, but they never found their way over.  The bar was quite busy that night, and perhaps the waitstaff was overwhelmed - but to sit there for almost half an hour without even having someone take our order was totally frustrating!  The menu looks great - just wish we had the opportunity to try it.",1,OpenTable Diner,New Orleans
"This was our 3rd time here. First two were good (why we came back). This visit was not good. Biggest reason was that the server had a significant attitude (and I'm a long time Chicago diner). Food was ok (when they brought us the right dish), but did not have the pop the last 2 times did.",2,Offlaw,Chicago
"Fantastic food/drinks that had a Iive band easy to dance to, or just listen. This helped for both myself and my girlfriend to have a memorable weekend! I can't wait to come back when the roof opens up with warm weather.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"I went on a Thursday afternoon when they have live music and happy hour specials. The restaurant itself is trendy and lively (I am sure it is AWESOME in summer when the roof opens up).  Ambiance is slick and cool, with the lighting dimmed and the mod decor. It was good for people watching and meeting for happy hour with friends. I felt like the food was not really anything special though and the menu was quite limited for any substantial meal.",3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
This was my 1st time here and I'll definitely be back. The food was good and so were the drinks. Love the atmosphere and the live music. It was a little pricey but the overall experience was great,5,KatF,Chicago
Boleo's take on Latin American cuisine is a wonderful fusion of authentic tastes and complimentary accents. My date for the evening spent time in Peru and was suitably impressed by the plates we shared. Add the open roof setting with it's unique vantage of Loop skyscrapers and Boleo is a great place to spend an evening or stop in before a show.,4,OpenTable Diner,Milwaukee
Good tapas.,4,OpenTable Diner,Indiana
Very good Peruvian food and drinks.  Good service.  Limited menu.  A little pricey.,4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"The acoustics in this place make it impossible to hear each other with the music playing. And it takes forever to get your food and drinks. But when they do come, it's great. But they definitely need more staff at the bar and in the kitchen and decide if this is a bar or a restaurant. Shame bc it's pretty. But not a repeat in my book.",3,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
Definitely more a bar than a restaurant. Exceedingly noisy. My wife and I had to fashion tissue into earplugs to not be in pain. They were out of most of the wines listed by the glass. Food was obviously designed to be prepped by amateurs at the last minute. The breading on the lobster tempura rolls did not seem to have been cooked. The ceviche was swimming in what seemed like just lime juice with very little fish.,1,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
I would love to come back with a group. Great atmosphere. The band was fantastic.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"I am a big fan of Boleo. I went when they first opened and loved the South American vibe. It's such a sexy, hot, chic space. I love the ambiance along with the live music. Plus service is excellent and food and drinks are great.   I booked this reservation to celebrate my birthday this week and Boleo went above and beyond for me. I arrived early with a cake and they kept it in the fridge in the kitchen for me until later in the evening. They escorted me to my table where they had framed celebration signs for me to celebrate my birthday and candles to set the mood.   My friends and I had a great space with couches and table with plenty of room for everyone. There were about 15-20 of us. From 4:30p-8p, Boleo has an excellent Happy Hour deal. They offer 8 food and drink items for just $8 that include several of South America's most popular bites and sips. There were delicious and refreshing piscos (pineapple cinnamon or strawberry guava), fernet and coke, red and white wine, empanadas, chicken skewers, and more all for just $8!!!!   Service was top notch. Our waitress constantly checked on us and took care of us all night. When it was time to bring the cake out they had candles lit and ready to go. Then they sliced the cake and made sure everyone got some. And they did a great job packaging up the leftovers cake for me to take home. And they also gave me a personal birthday card with notes and signatures from all staff.   The music was great, too, and everyone had a blast. The whole group really enjoyed the place . All of my friends loved the food, drinks, service, and atmosphere. I can't wait to go back. I hear the ceviche is excellent and I cannot believe I didn't order any!!!",5,NowYouKnow,Chicago
Great vibe!  I was surprised more people were not there at the time.  The food was delicious.,5,OpenTable Diner,Columbus
"The food was good, especially the veggie empanadas. The Manhattan I ordered from the bar was spectacular! Best I ever had.",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Well- I wanted to be able to make this a rave but... their advertising made it a rather confusing experience. We went downtown for New Year's Eve at the Gray (the hotel which houses Boleo). We made the reservation on open table, and it noted there was a $100 fee for a New Years party with music and hors doevres. It didn't ask for a credit card. The day before the event, we got a call from Boleo saying that we would only be guaranteed a table for 90 minutes- and then we'd have to move to the bar, with no guarantees of a spot. When I went back to the hotel website, the party was noted as being $175!  So, when we got to the hotel, we had the desk call Boleo. They assured us we could stay until midnight. They were nice to us, served us from the menu , and we got to see the band and other entertainers. In fact, I think they handled it well. But, it was a whole awkward scenario which could have been avoided by updating their open table listing to match their website.",4,C1959,Chicago
"The food was excellent however we were the only guests dining. The drinks were also very good, but under poured. We mentioned this to the bartender and instead of remedying it immediately he argued with us.",3,Jennifer,Chicago
"Love Peruvian food and very happy that Tanta has a competitor in the loop area.  The cocktails are fun and creative combinations.  The food, all tapas, was limited in its scope.  This is not a sit-down dinner spot, but rather a place for a cocktail and a small bite, or two to share.  We were hungry and had to repeat a pair of dishes to leave satisfied.  We would return for a cocktail and light snack, but not for dinner.  The ceviche de conchas was the star player, indeed, the only menu item that could compete with Tanta's amazing cuisine.  Tanta remains the only Peruvian spot for dinner in the loop, but this is a fun cocktail option and so happy it is south of the river.",4,ChicagoDiner,Los Angeles
Disappointing. It all could have been better.,3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Had one of every food on menu with group of 4. Best was rice and also ceviche. Salmon Xavier excellent. Drinks were very good had drink with ginger like Moscow mule very good. Rest of group enjoyed old fashioned. Service nice-very thoughtful and attentive. Brought friend who had a cough tea without even asking- nice touch. Noise level very loud and music not really different over the 3 hours we were there. Very dark atmosphere was relaxing but also hard to see menus. Would go back again.,4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"My husband and I went to Boleo because they had empanadas on the menu.  I spent some time in Argentina, and it's not often, even in Chicago, that you can get an empanada like I came to love when I was there.    We make fabulous food and craft cocktails at home, so I don't say the following lightly.  Boleo has these awesome complex and delicious cocktails that I would not even attempt to recreate at home.  I had a tequila cocktail that had smoked tomato water, and it was fabulous.  All the dishes we had were great, including the conch ceviche, beef heart skewers, the carne empanadas (the reason for our visit, and very authentic!), and the trio of potato purees.  The flavors and textures were very bold.  Everything was delicious and surprising.  It was not a cheap meal, and  we were totally happy with the cocktails, food, and service.  This is a great place to spend a special evening with a fellow adventurous eater.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Service is very good and the food combinations for the most part are fine but a little different and not recommended for trepidatious diners.  Not recommended for children and in fact they have a prohibition on children.  Best suited for night life crowd.    The music is creates a nice South American atmosphere, but... they would do a lot better if they would turn the music down by a few notches as you can't hear the person next to you it is so loud (and I like loud music); it is uncomfortable.",3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Amazing atmosphere, very sexy, dark, perfect spot for a date. Amazing food, small plates, shareable. Great wine and cocktails. Highly recommend.",5,OpenTable Diner,Las Vegas
"The food was interesting, delicious, unique -- and somehow it all added up to a spectacular experience. All four of us found it to be the highlight of our Chicago weekend.",5,OpenTable Diner,Cleveland
"The space is very cool and the food was delicious but the portions were incredibly small. The waitress recommended 2-3 dishes per person. In reality we had to order 5-6 per person, which resulted in a high bill at the end of the night.",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
The menu was different than what was posted online,2,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"The hostess was super rude. More than half of the tables were empty and refused to seat us without a reservation. I made an open table reservation and then she finally seated us at a DIRTY table next to 3 clean ones. The food was decent and our server was nice but a little slow considering it wasn't that busy.   If you're at the Kimpton Gray, do yourself a favor and go to Vol 39 or head around the corner to Cochon Volant.",2,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Great food and excellent drinks.  The food menu is a bit sparse and there were some hiccups with the service.  Nothing that would prevent me from going again though I would recommend it for drinks and shared plated over a full dinner.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"The loveliest experience. Delicious food aside, the service and attention to detail, and genuine warmth shone through. We were celebrating my friend Bryan's birthday, and the entire restaurant staff seemed to take it upon themselves to make sure he had the best birthday dinner (and dessert!) possible. They even gave him a signed birthday card! &lt;3",5,vtan,Chicago
Ambiance was great. Music by DJ was amazing and bartenders were incredible and very attentive. Looking forward to coming back.,5,OpenTable Diner,Milwaukee
We will return to this cool Argentine hip place. Glass roof a plus but honestly everything else was good too.,3,toronto55,Chicago
"More suited for cocktails and appetizers, not dinner. The menu is very limited and overpriced. You're paying for the location and the view of the city through the roof. I would only go for cocktails.",3,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"Very pleased with the addition of Boleo as a restaurant option for people living in downtown and anyone visiting downtown Chicago. Unfortunately,  it was too cold for the retractable roof to be opened, but our food was wonderful and the service was excellent. Having the good fortune to have traveled to Peru and enjoy their cusine, I can state without reservation, their Pisco Sours were better than even the Peruvian piscos. The food was fresh and wonderfully prepared.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Excellent food! Great choices to accommodate all tastes.,4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Love this place, brunch is fabulous!",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Great food with great friends, awesome environment. Happy hour was a hit",5,SarahB,Chicago
The menu descriptions did not match the product and the waitress kept trying to up sell when we said we were in a rush - not genuine.  Decent for bar food.,3,AngelaT,Seattle
"I took a chance on booking this restaurant through Open Table by the reviews. The occasion was my daughter's birthday and we wanted something casual but nice. Earl's fit the bill! Food was very tasty and served well. The only problem was that my daughter and her boyfriend ordered a pitcher of mango Margaritas and received regular Margaritas. I assume it was the manager who brought a little glass of mango syrup to add to the drinks/ pitcher. I feel that he should have taken back the whole pitcher and made it right. The server was very pleasant and helpful although probably new because she was unsure of several things and had to come back to our table several times for clarifications of menu choices.  Overall, I would go back in a heartbeat for the food and ambience.",4,JMBE,Chicago
"Earl's is always good, for couples or a larger group of friends.  We like the tuna tostadas and those chopped up ribs!  Entree choices are interesting and varied.  Steak, Salmon and Chicken are all good  as are the Asian offerings.  Dinner salads are also great.  Outdoor seating is fun.  Price is reasonable and the crafted cocktails are a hit with my wife!  A keeper for sure!",5,JohnandCece,Chicago
"Everyone loved their food, drinks were great, and the boozy freeze-pops were a bonus hit!",5,Al868686,Chicago
"I have been to this restaurant 3 times. The first time , it had not been open long but the food was good. The second time we sat outside &amp; something was off about the experience &amp; I didn't like the food. However, last evening went with a friend &amp; we sat outside under the curtain . It was a pleasant experience. I don't think the menu is much. And the food ok. Our waitress last evening was wonderful.",2,Deni,Chicago
"The fish tacos weren't anything special, the tortilla tasted generic and bland. The waitress brought my drink and it was the wrong drink. She then realized this after I drank from it and preceded to take that drink spill it out and give me what I ordered. I feel like that is a waste. I would've happily kept that drink at no charge. I requested outdoor seating at the time of making the reservation and was seated indoor even thought I could see open seating outside.",2,AndyB,Chicago
Everything I have ordered that Earls has been awesome so far. Looking forward to going back!,4,Lovehiddengems,Chicago
"This was a wonderful pre-movie dinner spot.  Grabbed a nice meal with apps and steak before a lovely movie date night.  Our server seemed a bit new to the industry but she was absolutely wonderful.  Genuinely nice, caring, and sweet.  This will now be our go to place before any movie we see at Arc Light.",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"The ladies at the hostess station were very polite when we told them of our reservation.  We requested to sit outside, were directed to our table, then sat for almost 20 minutes.  No one came to our table, brought us waters, asked for any order, etc.  We saw several waitresses go to every table around us, even two that were seated after us, but never stop or even say they'd be right back to get our order.  I went up to the front hostess station to see if they were unsure if we were in their section or something.  Immediately after, a waitress came over and got our order and brought us a drink menu.  The food was great although a little expensive.",3,Emily,Chicago
"Went there for a bite before seeing a movie. We were seated outside and were not warned that a radio show was taking place directly outside the venue and it was SUPREMELY LOUD. Secondly, the waitress took forever with our food, and when it did  come- it was grossly over-seasoned and not well prepared. We wound up leaving and walking over to Nando's to have dinner after our disappointing appetizers and drinks.",1,Confused,Chicago
Lovely outdoor space. Great wine list and menu. Have enjoyed every meal I have had there! Wonderful addition to the neighborhood!,5,Kathy,Chicago
"Service was horrible. Nice staff, but SO slow. Waited 20 minutes to even be approached and given water. Another 30min before drinks arrives. Food order was taken by our server. Then 20 minutes later the manager comes back over to take the order AGAIN. We weren't in a rush and staff was apologetic. BUT there were 2 hostesses up front doing nothing that could been helping if the servers were short staffed like they claimed. Our server said he was the only server that day! For inside and outside. On a holiday Monday (Memorial Day). That's crazy! Food was tasty. But I won't risk going there again if I'm ever in a time crunch..",2,Jojo,Chicago
Great menu!,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Loved the patio experience.  Food and service were excellent!  Definitely going back soon.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
I was there for a work dinner with some out of town guests. I had been there before and knew the food was good and drinks even better. Service is great and the outdoor dining is wonderful. Will be back.,4,cw1984,Chicago
"Service was great, food was great. Enjoyed the experience and look forward to going back again soon.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Thank you for a great brunch! Large groups are easily accommodated!,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Overall, we enjoyed our time at Earls.  The food was good and atmosphere was lively.  The service was fair, but not great.  Our server was very friendly and nice, however we had to ask for our water to be refilled a few times.  There were a couple of things we requested that were forgotten, so we had to ask more than once.",3,Abby,Chicago
I've been to Earl's a bunch of times and am never disappointed. Food is consistently good. Love the Dynamite Roll (always order it).  Steaks are great and cooked just as you order them. Leroy's Crispy Ribs are a nice twist to the usual heavily sauced ribs. Service is attentive and friendly.  Definitely one of my favorite spots.,5,rickey,Chicago
Service was painfully slow. Fish &amp; Chips looked anemic and had no discernible taste other than under done coating. Ribs were good. Coleslaw for one person in.our party had no dressing...It was simply shredded cabbage and onions clumped on the plate,2,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Honestly? I have no complaints. The decor is nice, not too loud, service was great (thanks, Anita!), food was tasty, price was good. Drinks were strong.   What more could you possibly ask for?",5,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
"Love this place! Ambiance and menu are phenomenal for the value. Lucky to have a reservation because the place was packed shortly after we were seated. Service became slow towards the end as far as getting packed and getting the check. We were worried we'd been forgotten, but other than that, everything was wonderful. And parking was compensated for ten dollars worth.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Perfect place for after-movie dining.  Large menu with small eats or large.  Great service!,5,OpenTable Diner,Cleveland
"Crispy ribs were over seasoned with salt, and then 2nd attempt too much pepper...as if to make up for the salt ? Burger was ok but avacado toast was tasty with a slight kick.",3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Our Restaurant Week meal was delicious.  There were two choices in each of three categories, with something for everyone.  While I had the combo of back ribs and chicken, my husband had the steak and sushi.  The other couple who joined up also split on the dinner choices, with everyone feeling that he/she had made the best choice.  Our server Anita was glad to provide guidance with wine choices as well as food selections.  The service, decor and food were all terrific.",5,restaurantweeklover,Chicago
This place really surprised me!  Huge restaurant with awesome staff and delicious food.  I will definitely be back when the weather gets warmer!!,5,JaclynD,Chicago
"This restaurant was magnificent. Everything from the appetizers to the desserts were fantastic! The four of us had 3 different dishes ranging from steak, to ribs and chicken, to salmon. Everything was great. The peanut butter cookie skillet was the literal icing on the cake! Fantastic. Can't say enough good things.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Excellent choice during Restaurant Week.  Lots of food for the special offering.  Service was outstanding.   Seems that very beautiful and intelligent people are employed to take care of guests needs.  Will return.,4,JoniG,Chicago
"Earl's was a good spot, nice restaurant and quality service. My wife and I went for restaurant week, and they had just run out of their signature dish steak and sushi. We both wanted to try that, so were bummed they had run out. The appetizers were solid - avocado toast and tuna tostadas! The dessert cookie was a little dry, but still tasty. The drinks were good as well. We had great service from our waiter, so all around good date night!",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Moist and deliciously seasoned salmon. Great ambiance (booth seating,  soft and warm lighting ) Attentive service.  Love watching the open kitchen activities.  Reasonable price. 1/2 price bottle of wine on Thursday is a plus! Will continue to return to Earl's.  Highly recommended! !",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"We came here during restaurant week because it's about a 5 minute walk to the Royal George Theater.  All the other close places were booked.  Wow,   am I glad they were.  I had the tuna tostada.  Fresh, clean, crisp good.  The entre  was the Steak + Sushi,  marinated steak, ponzu sauce, dynamite roll, unagi maple and sriracha mayo. Zowie my taste buds danced to this surf and turf combo. I'd never think to pair steak with sushi.  I'm sure glad the chef did.  Btw, the atmosphere was swank, but not snooty.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Went for restaurant week.  Good energy, fantastic service, and great food.",4,AMH1,Chicago
Loved yhe food. I wanted everything on the menu... ended up going with chicken and ribs andf it did not disappoint. I dont even like coleslaw but theirs was so fresh and tasty I couldnt resists. Will be returning to check out more of the menu.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Came to Newcity mall for a movie and bowling so stopped here for lunch.  The food was decent.  Service was Ok.  The place overall is very modern in design and probably will come back to try dinner where it could be a better overall experience.,4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Earl's Kitchen and Bar exceeded our expectations.  From the warm welcome at the hostess counter to our very attentive server, Matthew to the fabulous gluten free items we were delighted.  My wife being a Celiac is always cautious at new restaurants, but she was assured that her GF choice were indeed gluten free.  I believe this is the first fish and chips she has had in many years.  We will recommend this restaurant and we will return. Thanks for the wonderful discovery.",5,RobertN,Chicago
Service and quality of food never disappoints. Have been there several times and the staff is great!,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"We had a large party (8), but scheduled an early reservation. We were seated right away, but our service was incredibly slow, and my food came out cold. The salads ordered by guests in my party did not look appetizing. It was very loud. The server did not take our drink order before our food order. I would not return for more than a quick cocktail before a movie, and maybe not even then.",3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Delicious!  Great appetizers, salads, entrees, and yummy desserts. Had to give it 5 stars for great prep and carefully sourced ingredients",5,europa,Chicago
Our waitress was one of the best I've ever had! Yummy food!,5,MeganH,Chicago
The food took forever.  The waitress disappeared for a long time.  She did give us a complimentary appetizer because of the delay-- which was a quarter loaf of  bread and olive oil-- not exactly filling or satisfactory for the six of us.  I ordered soup as an appetizer and it came with the meal-- which was just annoying.  I asked the waitress to give me the check which she plopped in the middle of the table.  It was also loud.  Not a fan.,2,JWC1,Chicago
One word...yummy!  I love this restaurant and the cocktails are outstanding! I love the Bees Knees and the Marilyn Monroe. Delish! The tuna tostada thing and truffle fries are my personal favorites. Can't wait to go back!,5,Bags,Chicago
"What a great find!  We found Earl's on OpenTable while looking for Mothers' Day options, and it was a perfect afternoon.  We got to sit outside on couches around a fire pit, they have heated umbrellas and overhead slats for shade if you want, and the ambiance is nice -- off-street in a kind of upscale square that reminded me of some of the places I've eaten in Europe.  Varied menu with a lot of fresh and healthy options, great drink options, large modern bar area opens to outside, and our server, Taylor, was a gem -- friendly, knowledgeable, upbeat, efficient, genuine.   Thanks!",5,CD32,Chicago
"We had a very enjoyable brunch experience. The outdoor seating is great for a nice Sunday morning. Although the brunch options were somewhat limited, all of the food was really great.",4,DGAR,Chicago
"Went on a Saturday at 1p. The double mojito drink deal is awesome - I had two and they were strong.  I ordered the sausage and mushroom hash. It was really tasty and I would order it again.  My friend has gone multiple times and enjoyed all of her choices there. I gave them a 4 out of 5 from a value standpoint - some portions seemed a little on the small side for the price point, but the quality is there.  The space is huge and open and great, and the staff were very friendly and attentive. Thank you!",5,NYCtoSLCtoChi,Chicago
"Earls was an amazing dinner from the appetizer, to the dinner, to the dessert. I also love their outdoor seating with the fire pits. I will definitely return.",5,FoodieNista,Chicago
"Love this place! They have an awesome outdoor patio, food was great, and service was even better. We'll be back for sure.",5,Janowsk,Chicago
"I ordered the salmon and green beans. Both were bland. Caesar salad also bland. I'm not that hard to please, but this was really bad.",1,Lynda,Chicago
We found the food creative and pleasing.  We had an exceptionally enthusiastic waiter who made our visit enjoyable.  I'd come back.,4,Mike606,Chicago
"This was the 2nd time my wife &amp; I had dined at Earl's, but the 1st time for the other 2 couples in our group.  All enjoyed the diverse, interesting menu items.  Service was good and the atmosphere is bright &amp; airy.  The drawback was the noise level.",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Title says it all.  I love walking to Earl's, the food and scene are great.    Additionally, they have a great selection on non-alcoholic drinks, my pregnant wife loves being able to still have a ""drink"" with her meal.",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Something for everyone. Affordable. Validated parking. Good location.,3,Lisa,Chicago
"I had the Cajun chicken ( I think that's what it was called)as my main course.  The spice rub was so strong and over bearing that it was pretty much inedible. I left most of my plate untouched.  Also there was no mention of bacon in the potato salad.  I, like a decent segment of the country, don't eat pork.  Typically if a dish is going to have bacon in it there is some mention of that.  I would have said something about it but the rest of the dish was so bad I didn't feel there was any point in trying to have it fixed.  My friend had the rib and chicken combo and said the same thing about the chicken.  He said the ribs were ok, that was pretty much all he ate from his dish.  The tuna tostada and the fish tacos were pretty tasty.  The ""sushi roll"" appetizer had so much rice, which was so al dente it bordered on raw, you couldn't taste anything else in the dish.",1,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
The food is way too salty.  Very nice ambiance and good service.,4,Rosie,Chicago
Awesome cocktails. Great food and service!!!,5,Jess,Chicago
"This can really be summed up as average. The food was OK but our service was quite poor. Bit of a strange and mixed up menu. Their steps of service as missing (forgetting silverware, no plates for shared apps, not refilling waters).",3,Hannah,Chicago
"We started off with the spinach dip.  Divine.  The warm kale salad was delicious.  My husband had the fettuccine Alfredo, which was rich and saucy. The service was professional and quick.   We will definitely return.",5,OpenTable Diner,Cleveland
"It's a great atmosphere,  and the drinks are exquisite.  I had the strawberry sprits, and it was refreshingly delicious.  Mug friend had an old fashion with a hint of root beer....  The chicken Santa Fe salad is awesome and the dynamite rolls are a must.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Fun and the server was friendly and knowledgeable  The rice bowl was good   Happy hour was decent   The tuna tostadas were delicious,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
We go to Earl's often and we like it.  The staff is great and the location is perfect for a pre/post movie meal.  The atmospherics can be a bit loud on a weekend evening but it's still the best option among restaurants in the New City shopping center.   Reservation recommended during the weekend...,4,Cyrano,Chicago
"My review is really not a ""valid"" review, for my friend and I did NOT end up eating at Earl's!!  We made a 6 pm reservation and planned to dine at Earl's, but when we sat down at one of the high tops near the bar, we found that the music was too loud for us to talk!!  So we left and ate elsewhere.  The menu looked great and service seemed good, but if you want a nice quiet play to talk, this is NOT your place!",2,JBChicago,Chicago
"Very posh interior, good food and attentive staff; when an order of eggs came out cold they re-made the dish and comped it.  Get the Bibimbap!",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"We always have a great experience at Earls, great area, friendly and prompt service, and always great food. Do not be afraid to expand your pallet here, I've never ordered something I didn't like.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Poor quality food; was our second try, wouldn't repeat.",2,LincolnParkDiner,Chicago
We love this place! The Brussels sprouts salad is our favorite.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
The Filipino Breakfast Bowl is my favorite at Earls. It's a weekend brunch item that they luckily also served all week during the holidays. Service is great and prices are reasonable. Great location too...near CTA train station for those taking public transportation and validated parking for those driving. It's never crowded the three times I've been there so the noise level is just right for conversation.,5,allegressive,Chicago
The restaurant was very understaffed.  The server told us the kitchen was swamped and would not accept new orders for 20 minutes.  He took our order 30 minutes later.  I ordered a burger which was tasty (although instead of the brioche bun it was supposed to be served on it was on sliced bread with no explanation).  Hopefully it was just an off night.,3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Group of 7.  Brought one entree and nothing else for 10 minutes.  No explanation. Then came back and said that they had run out of buns for burgers. Comped desserts.  Unacceptable.,2,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Great meal! And a great deal on half of bottles of wine. Can't beat that. ;) I'm actually going again tonight!,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Very friendly and nice service.  Food is always a little more creative than you'd expect from a chain.,5,Mike606,Chicago
Very good food with healthy options for a good price. Our server (Taylor?) was very friendly and helpful regarding information on all menu items.,5,JonChicago,Chicago
Interesting menu. More vibrant energy in high top section,4,KByum,Chicago
"My friends and I came here for dinner before a movie. It was a great spot and we definitely want to come back. The menu has quite a variety of options including: salads, burgers, sushi, tacos, etc.",5,chicagofoodie89,Chicago
"Drinks were decent..... ordered a Tuna app but for the price &amp; getting 4 chips with about 2 chunks of tuna per chip &amp; a tasty sauce.... meeeeh. The first ordered medium rare bacon burger had the bacon medium rare noooo bueno. The second one came out well done.... we decided not to send back. The Cajun cheddar sandwich ordered had the skinniest piece of chicken..... for being off the beaten path and the multiple places chicago has to offer it's hard to recommend this place. 2 drinks per person one comped drink, one app, and two sandwiches $100.plus with a non deserving 20% tip.  Soooooooooo not worth it! #sorrynotsorry",1,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
We've dined here many times and have always been happy with the great food and friendly service.,5,Devo,Chicago
"Outstanding service, nenu was carefully carctwd with great balance of flavors. I will return very soon! Keep it up!",5,OpenTable Diner,Miami
"What's the point of going to a restaurant if you can't hear you need to shout to you partner?  We're there for 20 minutes and left, searching for a different place/",1,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Food was delicious, and the small plate concept allows us to try more things without either feeling too full or wasting food.  Server accurately guided us with how many dishes to order.  Service was friendly and knowledgeable.  First cocktails took a long time - maybe hire an additional bartender for this restaurant which features craft cocktails?  We enjoyed our visit and will return.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"This is a classic example of a place that really is a cocktail bar, that happens to have food. It's not a place to eat and have cocktails. Small portions, flavorful food, very loud and solid cocktails. I can't recommend this place for a meal. But, if you want grab some drinks, this will do.",3,AdamK,Chicago
"Service was awful. First drink order came 40 minutes after we ordered, and came with our food.",3,RB566,Chicago
"The experience was wonderful. The food was great, service was great, and the ambiance was awesome.",5,Chitowndiner,Chicago
"Super fast kitchen, service was excellent. A great place to eat before a show in the theater district.",5,Capdineout,Chicago
"Very good service, lovely ambience. Food lacked flavor and was quite expensive for a not so tasty small plate. Cocktail was fine, nothing extraordinary. Dessert was the most enjoyable. Overall a pleasant experience but not worth the cost.",2,BKBK,Chicago
"The great room at the top of The Grey, with its retractable roof and mood lighting and pumping beat, is serving up creative Peruvian small bites and small plates, the food well-spiced and beautifully plated. The vegetarian and beef enchaladas, the skewered beef hearts, tuna tataki and a wonderful lobster tempura roll were highlights. Service was professional and friendly with a great knowledge of the total menu. The beers, drinks and wines -- all top drawer.  What a night.",4,WexOne,Chicago
"I love sharing small plates and this place was perfect for that. Amazing food, great service and nice atmosphere.",4,OpenTable Diner,Washington DC
Fabulous ambience.  Good food. Excellent drinks,4,jwillie,Chicago
"The ambiance was nice and unique. I thought the open roof was really cool although overall you don't really get a true ""rooftop"" feel from the space. The bartenders were great. I would come back for drinks mostly because of them. And the birthday recognitions were a very nice treat for me as well.",3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Boleo is a great date spot with small plates and a great bar scene. The plates are small so for 2 people you probably need 4-5 plates depending on what you get so the cost does add up.,5,Mikey,Chicago
Very nice cozy place to stop for a drink or good dish . Live music makes vibrant bar atmosphere.,4,gosia,Las Vegas
Great addition to date-night options.  Opening the ceiling adds a wonderful atmosphere  but it's not crucial to the overall ambiance.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
The drinks were ok but the food was not good i ask for a ceviche  they give me 4 medium shrimp and 5 peruvian corn swimming in almost a cup of tomato liquid  with a lot lemon and salt  not good taste and rest the food was to small sizes not recommend if are hungry....,3,RobertL,Chicago
"Good tapas, great drinks and fun atmosphere. Not a huge menu but done well.",4,OpenTable Diner,Washington DC
"Our server was so friendly and informative, her recommendations were perfect. We loved everything!",5,OpenTable Diner,New Orleans
Great girls night or date night out. Drinks were really great. Food was delicious too!,5,GOAT,Detroit
"Food was wonderful, if paced a little quickly for my preference. The location is fabulous, so dress up a tiny bit.",5,KristinS,Chicago
"Not just another new roof-top, Boleo provides a gorgeous setting, creative mixologists, friendly staff, and wonderful Peruvian-themed food. The service is prompt and friendly; the two of us could have been in and out in an hour or so, but we ordered ""a little more of this, a little more of that"" because it was all tasty and we simply didn't want to leave yet. We'll go again and again, especially for the tuna tataki and to try out the many interesting drinks - pisco, cachaça, fernet, and other unusual alcohols adding unique spins to traditional coctels.",5,JKChicago,Chicago
"New place trying hard to make themselves ""hip"". Excellent drinks (both mixed and straight) and amazing food. High price point. Seems target audience might be older. But music very loud and casual seating more for bachelorette parties and younger weekend party crowds.",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Within the first week and a half of opening, I came to Boleo 4 times!! Steadfast was delicious, the Gray is stunning, and now Boleo is truly the cherry on top. Creative and delicious drinks, a DJ that plays Lambada, well-executed food, gorgeous design, variety of seating options and the best part: continuing to enjoy yourself without having to cram into a smaller space around 11:45 when the retractable roof closes in.",5,sofiadujour,Chicago
"I noted that this was a birthday celebration and Boleo presented a birthday card, signed by the servers wishing my friend a great birthday, plus their delicious shortbread cookie with candle!  Boleo' Old Fashion Drink is the best ever!",5,3sisters,Chicago
"The service was amazing.  The staff went above and beyond to accommodate us.  We were celebrating our friends engagement, and they made it extra special for her.   Offering us drinks to celebrate and a special note for the bride to be!  This restaurant is perfect for large parties and unique cocktails.  Beautiful restaurant.",5,DDJ1,New York Area
"Ceviche Classico/Anticuchos/empanadas were a noble representation of Peruvian cuisine, beautifully plated as well. Fun ambiance, yet still able to have a conversation. The only downside was the overly syrupy cocktails, but may have been poor choices on our part. Great for a date.",4,ConciergeTim,Chicago
"Loved Boleo! Really excellent small plates and wonderful Peruvian (and Argentinian) flavors. Everything we tried was great. Keep in mind it is small / sharing plates. Cocktails were fantastic and I had the best Pisco Sour I've had outside of Peru itself. The retractable glass roof is so cool for either sitting under the stars with Sears (Willis) Tower views above in warmer weather and I'm sure it will be a fun / bright atmosphere in the cooler months, too, with that glass ceiling overhead. Service was great, atmosphere was vibrant but not obnoxious. DJ was spinning latin music that was just loud enough to create a fun ambiance but not annoying and hard to hear your dining partner. I highly recommend this spot and look forward to returning.",5,Mason,Chicago
"So fun! Really a unique place to bring friends/family, especially out-of-towners. Amazing drinks and food and vibes! Retractable roof makes the place extra special, not to mention the DJ on select nights!",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Was expecting a menu with more than just appetizers and drinks, and our party of 4 was hungry for real food, so we made a meal out of myriad appetizers.  They were tasty, but it made for some expensive dining with drinks!  Nice venue, and gracious hosts and servers made it a lovely evening.",3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Service was a little slow to begin with, we had to flag down a server after 10 minutes. The space is marketed as a roof-top bar, but there really aren't any views from the dining area. It just has a retractable roof. It was still a beautiful space, and the food was excellent.",4,OpenTable Diner,Columbus
"Given the low floor, I was concerned this ""rooftop"" would be a tough sell but boy was I wrong. What Boleo lacks in rooftop views it makes up in everything else. And actually, you can see the Sears Tower and a few other high rises from the atrium-style retractable rooftop so there's plenty of fresh air while surrounded by highrises.  In love with the decor, spacious layout with a variety of seating options, stellar Latin beats, and creative cocktails. I've already been twice and can't wait to keep coming back.  The cherry on top is not having to move somewhere else at midnight when the rooftop closes - just stay put and keep enjoying yourself while the roof retracts and encloses.",5,sofiadujour,Chicago
"Loved the atmosphere. Food was fabulous, other than the lobster roll (which is a good idea but misses the mark). Service needs some work; we were there within the first two weeks of opening, so there is time to improve.   Music is loud but you get used to it.",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"More of an open air atrium.  When we arrived there was a brief rainstorm that caused them to close the roof, and although it was sunny and in the 70's minutes later, the roof remained closed, which took away from the ambience.  All the cocktails went a bit too far on the sweet side and there were limited beer options.  Food was okay, bit on the pricey side for the portions.  Not sure I'll return.",2,JKM81,Chicago
The cocktail menu was exceptional as was the food.  Highly recommended for a high energy environment and rooftop experience in Downtown Chicago.  Servers were very accommodating and friendly.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Terrible service. Reservation was at 8, and we then asked for outside seating. We were told it would be 20-25 minutes, but if we waited at the bar, they would text us. No one texted us, so at 8:30 we asked about the table, and they said they could seat us now (no apologies/explanation). We were seated outside and then waited 20 mins before we finally asked someone to bring us water and take our order (no one acknowledged us). Then the manager took our order, with no apologies/explanation for the delay, so it took an hour to get attention. The food was mediocre - chicken sandwich and sushi were fine, but salads were drenched, and the truffle fries had some oniony taste (not just garlic/truffle oil). Rest of the evening had poor service, no explanations from staff, and the only redeeming factor was a discount on cocktails. It is a 10-min walk from our apartment, but I will not go back.",2,SF34,Chicago
"Great place! Location, the people, staff. Must def try",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Earl's is becoming increasingly popular. Had a 6:15 PM reservation on a Saturday and the place was already strating to get busy.  The food was ver tasty. Our server was pleasant but seemed a bit overwhelmed.,4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Not my first time there but the food and service are always good. Great menu selection depending on how much you want to eat and there's a a good selection of custom cocktails if that's what you're in the mood for.,5,HerbM,Chicago
The music was too loud and unable to hear dining partners conversation,4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
That Korean sauce is the bomb!,4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Quiet for the lunch hour, food was excellent - quality and preparation excellent, left full.  Nice bar and social gathering area.",5,LFC77,Chicago
Perfect date night place especially if you are going to the theater. They offer 20% off if you have your movie ticket and a free popcorn.,5,Bill,Houston
"The restaurant was fairly empty, and we still had bad service.",2,DCfoodies,Washington DC
"Loved the atmosphere, ambiance and the service was fantastic. The only thing I do wish they use less ice in those mohito pitchers. Everything else was great! Our server Mathew was awesome!!! 👌👌",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Waiters forgot drink for 1 in party 2x,3,Bags,Chicago
Looks cuter in the pictures - inside is nice and there is a lovely patio but it has sort of a mall location which I wasn't looking for.,3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Server was not really around. Food took almost an hour.,2,Scooter,Dallas
Great service and wonderful food.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
We have been to Earl's 4 times and it never fails to impress.,5,GP1986,Washington DC
The food took a while to come out but everything else was amazing!!!,5,CMD1,Chicago
"Earls has a good menu selection of food and drinks.  It also has a cool vibe and outdoor seating.  The food was good, service could have been a bit better as Our waiter forgot our second round of drinks.  It is in the neighborhood so will go again.",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
We eat at Earl's frequently. Service has always been great.  The avocado toast and wings are yummy appetizers. We love the Korean wings for their spicy flavor.,5,luvchicago,St. Louis
My friend was in from out of town and earls was a perfect place to go that's upscale and fun.,5,Mary,Chicago
"This was my third visit to Earl's.  The bibimbop and warm kale salad were good.  It wasn't that crowded but it was very loud and difficult to talk to the person across from me.  There was a huge crash behind us as a server dropped several plates of food off of a tray.  I felt sorry for that table because not five minutes later, we heard a glass break, and when I turned to look, a woman at the same table was wiping food/liquid off of her husband's back.  I hope they got their entire check comped.",3,Cindy,Chicago
My and my friend try the super avocado brunch and was amazing the mix of flavors and one single dish including the spicy touch which chirracha sauce and perfect pouched eggs and the side salad simple but great.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"We went to Earl's for the first time on a Sunday evening.  Parked in parking garage (ticket validated - 1st 2 hours free), party of 5  - everyone ordered something different and everyone was happy with their food.  It's an interesting environment with tables in the bar area, tables and couches in the restaurant area, and also a small outdoor area.  It was not busy being a Sunday at 7pm so noise level not loud.  I am sure that it gets super busy at prime times.  I would recommend this restaurant!",5,mbeaj,Chicago
"Johnny, our waiter, was terrific! The food was really really good.",5,Tammy,Chicago
"So I really like Earls. I fell in love with their warm kale salad back in the fall and then they took it off the menu. But when I went back a few weeks ago they put it back on. Yay! However, I went this past Saturday and apart from them kind of screwing up our reso and having to rush through our dinner at the couch which was not really that comfortable, the salad was not as good as usual. It was not as ""warm/cooked"" as it usually is and not as flavorful. Plus, the salmon, which I had asked for medium rare, was not and was not as good as usual. Interestingly when someone else went to order salmon they were told that the kitchen had determined the salmon was not up to their standards so they were not serving it. Hmm was mine a substandard piece? I did have the worst stomach pains all night so who knows? So I will go back and hopefully things will be back to usual.",3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Good food but the music is fairly loud so it may not be appropriate if you have members of your party with hearing challenges.,3,Auntie,Chicago
"The food is amazing, 5/5. Unfortunately the service consistently has been poor. And randomly their soda is always flat.",3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Only issue is that the music is just too loud... Conversation with more than the person next to you is impossible,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Took forever to be acknowledged by the hostess and the service was sllloooowwww.,2,OpenTable Diner,Milwaukee
"We've always been delighted with Earl's...so glad they're in the neighborhood.  Food and drink –great selection across all price points. Spring and Summer outdoor dining is wonderful...even heated fire pit areas in colder months.  We've never hesitated to take friends or suggest Earl's. New City may have added traffic congestion to our neighborhood, but it has brought excellent dining and cinema.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
This was my second time at Earl's.  The food was good each time.  We especially enjoy the atmosphere of the enclosed patio.  It's a nice spot to talk with friends or a date.,4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Only about to review based on cocktail, and overall experience. I really liked this place! The service was great; we had a bubbly, attentive and helpful waitress. We each got a drink; I tried an old fashioned which was quite strong....it wasn't the best old fashioned i'd ever had, but it was decent!  One notable feature about this place is the size; it's a huge space, and despite the number of tables, it still feels cozy. The restaurant also has a very open feel and flow to it. I really enjoyed it!   I will definitely be back for food; drinks were decent, but not spectacular, and the good service and atmosphere certainly didn't hurt.",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Honestly, I was so pleasantly surprised after dining here before catching a show at Arc Light in the same New City complex. The food was fantastic and not super expensive given the area.  The drinks were delicious and $2 off on the weekends! It was so great we actaully went back after the show to grab a night cap at the bar. Highly recommended!",5,FreakinFowler,Chicago
We really liked that the waitress asked if anyone at the table had any good allergies. That's was a plus for us since 3 out of six of us did. Great service.,5,NycoleRussell17,Chicago
"Hi, This was my first time here! I loved the fish and my Mom enjoyed her fried chicken! The food was wonderful and the scene breathtaking! It's hard to find parking there.",5,QueenJacqueline,Chicago
"Outstanding service, great food, and great drinks!",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Unfortunately, the food was mediocre. The variety offered meant no type of cuisine ever came to the forefront. While the appetizers our group shared were good (Korean wings and truffle fries), the drinks had little alcohol and my entree (bibimbap) was far from authentic. The venue decor and space was also fairly boring. Modern, with no actual personality.",3,Joselyn,Washington DC
Not enough food for the price. The waiter never ask did we want water the Cole slaw was too creamy the ribs was not a full slab the place was nice .,4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Overall good but a few things I would have expected from a restaurant of this caliber.  We went for a birthday and specifically asked when I made the reservation if it was an occasion.  I noted birthday and the hostess and waitress were aware.   There was no fanfare.  I don't know if I should have asked for a candle or something but we ordered dessert and it was just brought out and there were no spoons.  We couldn't find anyone to ask so we ended up eating the ice cream with a fork.  Our entree arrived with our salad and we would have liked the salad first but it was all brought out at one time.  These are minor things but I just expected a little more from a restaurant like Earl's.  Our server was good; in fact we made a revision to our order and she was able to take care of that so we didn't want to keep complaining so we ate our salad while our food sat and got cold.,3,TheresaM,Chicago
This place was just okay. Pricey bar food.,3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Hostess was really good. They accommodated our last minutes changes to reservation without any delays. Food was delicious!,4,Dita,Chicago
Picked this place after seeing it on a TV show a couple years ago and finally decided to go. Portions are huge and the food was very good. Many people in my party were disappointed because the dinner menu that's posted online is no longer being served.  Our server was primarily working alone and was also taking care of the bar too so the service wasn't the greatest.,4,Keis,Chicago
Food not as good as the Hash House in Florida and the menu is different.,3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"We looked at their menu on their website, which included both a brunch and a dinner menu. However, the dinner menu no longer exists. Stick to brunch or lunch unless you don't want dinner fare. The fried chicken was excellent, but only available in the brunch format.",3,BillB,Chicago
"I've had brunch in a lot of places in Chicago, but Hash House is something else! The portions are MASSIVE, the food is delicious, and prices are very reasonable. For 4 people we ordered 2 dishes and flapjacks and we ended up not finishing and of the plates!",5,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
"The food and atmosphere was really nice. The service and our server was relatively quick. The only complaint was that the food wasn't 'It was just cooked hot'. Our biscuit was cold &amp; hard, so we know that it had been sitting on a tray.",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Just ridiculously good on all fronts. Highly recommended.,5,Dill,Chicago
"Fantastic room, decor, food and service.  Really couldn't ask for better in terms of a really nice meal.  Well done!",5,EricG,Chicago
We had a very large sampling of the menu and everything was very delicious! Chef Ricardo has done a great job with the menu.,5,ChefStevenQueen,Washington DC
Loved the ambience and drinks. Food was mediocre and majority had too much sodium. Food selection was also not the greatest.,3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Travelle is the kind of place you bring a date, it's pretty, quiet, great food and great service. It's not where you come for a vibrant bar scene. It's got simple decor and great food.",4,Resa,New York Area
Fabulous small plates. Prepared perfectly. Described well by server. Chic and inviting.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Best mussels ever!,5,dek116,New York Area
"Had a great visit!  Enjoyed multiple items and our server, Naomi, was amazing!  She had great recommendations and was a pleasure to have at the table.  She even surprised us with a complimentary champagne toast to celebrate our recent engagement!  Can't wait to come back!",5,Perfect,Chicago
Miss the original menu. I hate when a restaurant gives up and dummy's down.,3,Erik,Chicago
"Fabulous cocktails, supper, and dessert! The restaurant takes advantage of the river and Marina City views, while the modern decor complements Mies van der Rohe's architecture. I'll be back for at least a cocktail next time I'm in town.",5,OpenTable Diner,Milwaukee
The service here is amazing--from the matre 'd calling me by name to our server acknowledging that we were celebrating our wedding and the maitre 'd wishing us congratulations as we left.    The served brunch was perfect and the buffet looked beautiful too.  We will be back very soon to have dinner or another brunch here.  In a word: lovely.,5,WindyCityDiner,Chicago
"The food here is amazing, creative and delicious!  I would definitely dine here again.",5,Kathy,Chicago
"Absolutely stellar. We enjoyed food from both the breakfast, lunch, and dinner menus. The Travelle Eggs Benedict was the best Eggs Benedict any of our party had ever tasted. The lobster portion was not at all stingy, the truffle smell perfumed the whole table, and the sauce was incredibly balanced. Amazingly, the Norwegian Eggs Benedict was almost as good--even when compared immediately after. Both had potatoes tossed in a preserved lemon that made us pause in appreciation.   The prawns were earthy and delicious. We used the toast with lemon aioli to mop up the prawn jus.   The rabbit sausage flatbread was delicious, particularly if you got a sizable piece of artichoke in your bite.   Special thanks to the cook for the off-menu preparation of deckle and morels.   All was superlative. I will definitely recommend Travelle.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"The food and service were outstanding!  You really get a sense that they are invested in their customers.  I had the lamb and it was fabulous. - best lamb chop I've ever enjoyed.  The wine list (the one for wines by glass) was robust - many options but not overwhelming.  Did not look at the full wine list.   Ambiance is very good and has a more modern, open look.  I tend to favor more cozy environs but the space grew on us over time as it was very thoughtfully planned.",5,Hobsnob58,San Francisco
Lots of seafood on Buffett (brunch) Waffle was amazing!!!,5,Indygal,Tampa
"The environment was fantastic, and the food was amazing.   Some incredible choices.    The price is what you expect for the area and the quality/service provided",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago

Met a client for dinner and we both really enjoyed the food and the restaurant I would definitely come back when I am in Chicago next year.,5,mauidiner,Houston
"A most excellent experience, from the moment we entered, until the time we left. A beautiful space on the second floor, off the lobby of the very modern The Langham CHicago hotel. The restaurant in style &amp; service &amp; experience fits the location. Everyone treated us exceptionally well, professionally, &amp; pleasntly. The cocktails, wine, &amp; food were all noteworthy &amp; delicious. We started with the delicious Asiago bread with nduja butter (made from a spreadable Italian spicy sausage), &amp; continued with delectable wild mushroom sauté as our 2nd appetizer. I had the incredibly  pillowy gnocchi with  rabbit sausage, fava beans &amp; cippoline. Outstanding! My husband had the lamb loin with grilled vegetables (the only slight minus was the undercooked carrots). After our meal, the manager offered us complimentary cocktails in the bar! An incredible setting &amp; wonderfully inventive &amp; tasty cocktail menu. We'll definitely return.",5,DinnerDiner,Houston
The food was outstanding and the ambiance was amazing,5,OpenTable Diner,Seattle
All around exceptional dining experience!,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Pleasant space, nice view, very nice staff. Comfortable benches, good champagne by the glass. Patagonia prawns appetizer is good; pricey, but large enough to share - 5 headed shrimp, toast (a bit overdone) drizzled w/ lemon aioli. The halibut special was excellent. Branzino good too. Cheesecake dessert is a fresh presentation; light and not too sweet.",4,Aaargh,Chicago
"The food at Travelle was fantastic.  I was with a party of 5 and folks raved about every single dish.  The presentation was really great, and especially the Spring Verrine on the dessert menu - the most unique dessert I've ever seen.  Also, I eat Paleo which makes for some challenges eating out.  The server worked so well with me to modify the menu items and was extremely accomodating of my needs.  Everyone else ate straight off the menu and no one was disappointed.  I would absolutely go back to Travelle.",5,OpenTable Diner,Raleigh
"Nice upscale setting. Very attentive service, v good food, taste and presentation. Would go back next time I am in Chicago.",4,Dandan,New York Area
Hands down this place was AWESOME!! Great space with an amazing view Fantastic service in both the restaurant and bar Great menu  Would HIGHLY recommend this place. For locals or out of towners (we are from Chicago),5,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
"Great service - Noami was great and it has been awhile since we met someone as attentive and knowledgeable about the menu.  The food was amazing and though the chef has changed, the experience was still amazing.",5,Naum,Chicago
"As we had a theatre event scheduled for 7:30pm, four of us were there at 5pm when they opened.   Highly suggest having a drink in the bar area, pre or post dinner. The 2nd floor bar area overlooking the river with floor to ceiling windows, one gets a view of the buildings as well. Unfortunately we arrived just before 5 &amp; didn't have time.   Bread &amp; butter - bread are dinner rolls, the pillowy dinner rolls that are served at a good diner. Butter is whipped with honey &amp; a bit of dijon mustard, sprinkled with sea salt. Enjoyable.   We started with: Crispy Octopus w/pork belly, salsa verde, harissa, sugar snap peas  Gnocchi w/rabbit sausage, fava beans, pea vines, cipollini onions Tortellini w/lemon mascarpone, asparagus, parmesan butter, frico Hamachi Crudo w/avocado, tomatillo, cilantro  The crudo and gnocchi were outstanding. Tortellini was good. Crispy octopus was not crispy at all, in fact the octopus was mushy.  Entrees: Pork &amp; Clams - Berkshire pork chop, manila clams, morels, ramps Pistachio Lamb Loin - spring vegetable fricassée, citrus jus The Fish Guy's Whole Fish for two   Pork &amp; Clams was very good, cooked perfectly, LOTS of morels, I was very pleased. Using those pillowy dinner rolls to soak up the broth was my favorite part.  The fish was sea bass, pan sauteed with thyme/herbs. Expertly executed, cooked perfect. Served with white asparagus &amp; shaved parmesan cheese.  Lamb was well executed but just didn't pop with flavor.   Service was very good, some small mishaps when our primary server wasn't around but we were very pleased overall.   Travelle was very nice &amp; provided a complimentary dessert in honor of Mother's day, while the Banana &amp; Peanut Butter Pot de Creme (nutella, malted milk ice cream) was calling out to me, we all decided on the Spring Verrine of blackberry sorbet, lemon black pepper ice cream, w/toasted meringue top. The lemon black pepper ice cream was amazing.",4,SweetWillie,Chicago
"Truly outstanding! Excellent host and superb food.  We started with the Hamachi crudo and the sweet English pea tortellini - both set a high bar, but the tortellini was like eating spring; great flavours.  We chose the Lamb and the steak as entrees - perfectly prepared and the sous vide lamb prep was perfect.  Dessert blew us away! We shared the blackberry sorbet with lemon pepper ice cream and meringue - truly wow. The addition of micro basil was genius.  Highly recommended!",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
Food came very quickly for a high-end Saturday evening and therefore felt rushed.  Quality of food was good - interesting - but not great.  Wine selected from list was said to be not available after a twenty minute search and well into our first course.  A substitute bottle was offered and -although accepted as a better alternative than going back to the list for another potential search -felt like a bait and switch afterward.,3,OpenTable Diner,Philadelphia
My risotto was luke warm as was grilled shrimp. Bronzino serving was scimpy,3,OpenTable Diner,Los Angeles
"We orders the octopus app, tuna tar tar app, and seared tuna on a bed of greens (I have allergies so some things were altered). Every bite was outstanding. They were also very accommodating with my restrictions without sacrificing taste. They also gave us complimentary champagne and a cupcake dessert, as we were celebrating a birthday. Will definitely be back!",5,TrendyDining,Chicago
"Food was delicious and fresh.  Chef was able to handle food allergy with grace and not forfeit recipe.   Space is handsome and comfortable. Staff was personable, informative, generous and accommodating. Great for treating out-of-town guests as well as oneself. I look forward to going again soon.",5,sexxy,Chicago
"For a sophisticated  early morning breakfast it is great.  Wonderful service, good food and a beautiful room to start your day.  Have been before and will go back.",4,LorettaL,New York Area
Rob was a fantastic server with tons of great suggestions and patience.,5,MissCubbie,New England
Travelle is one of my favorite places to enjoy a nice lunch in the city. The ambiance is always fantastic and the service superb! I will always come back for more.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Entree's were a bit off the mark. Maybe we just ordered wrong..,3,APPPP,Chicago
"The room is lovely, the food was absolutely delicious. Not an extensive menu, however, everything was so delicious that we looked forward to returning. The bar scene is lively with a live three piece combo playing music. What a treat!!   This place is wonderful for a special occasion or a great night out.",5,DiDi,Chicago
Always a great experience. A great place for lunch - and New Years Eve-,5,JustAmom1,Chicago
"Three of us had a breakfast meeting, and they sat a family with an infant directly beside us.  The baby cried most of the breakfast, and we could not hear ourselves to converse.    There were other open tables where they could have accommodated the party of 6 with 2 children other than beside the 3 of us.   It did not leave me with a good impression of the staffs awareness of their guest's needs.",3,Divagourmet,Chicago
Beautiful view... Breathtaking  Top notch service .... Incredible wine... Fabulous food. Wonderful special date night destination!    We will be back for sure!,5,OpenTable Diner,Grand Rapids
"Everything was very good, other than my salad and entre were served at the same time.  I didn't touch my salad since I didn't want my entre to get cold.  Took the salad home.",4,Hollou,Chicago
"Ordered a the California chicken sandwich. Halfway through eating it, I noticed it was actually undercooked with visible raw sections.  The manager came over with a meh apology and it was eventually taken off the bill but the overall dinner was spoiled at that point.",2,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
They did not care about reservations they made us wait for table and did not acknowledge my birthday,3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"We were seated early in the evening outside, but not off the square, which would have been preferable.  Did not like hip hop music blaring in my ear when trying to have a conversation.  Sauce on salmon was too rich and overpowering.  Good toffee pudding and drinks.",3,Olive10,Chicago
"Our waitress was so accommodating  to our large group. We asked to sit outside and even though the hostess said it could not work for our group size, our waitress found a solution. She was attentive and even brought a special drink from the bar compliments of the bartender to celebrate our bride to be. We greatly appreciate it!",5,KellyK,Chicago
Great restaurant overall! Have been here several times. Our waitress misunderstood our order and brought the wrong dish. Management was very generous and offered the dish on the house. We will be returning 👍🏻,5,OpenTable Diner,Toronto
So-so for dinner if are looking for a quick bite after a movie at the Arclight Theatre.,2,Chicagotarheel,Chicago
"We went to Earls before a movie and although our server was very attentive and friendly, the food did not make up for it. There are so many terrific restaurants in Chicago that bland, boring food just doesn't cut it. The food was unexciting and tasted bla. My boyfriend always loves tacos and thought they were bad. My salad was also extremely boring. To top it off, the drinks were weak. The ambiance was nice, but all in all, experience wasn't great due to the food.",2,foodiegal22,Chicago
"Good food but a real glitch in the usually competent service. We waited a good 15 minutes for drinks. Appetizers never came and the waiter let us know that the entrees were on the way and he forgot to put in the appetizer order, and did we want them after the entrees. Pretty odd and surprising , a disappointing experience especially because we brought an out of town guest. We live in the neighborhood and have been to Earls multiple times. They need to pick up the pace  and level of attention to detail.",2,CookieJar,Chicago
"I had my Birthday celebration there with friends and family this past weekend. We were a large group of 13 and our table was ready when we arrived and Erin was our server from start to finish.  She was fabulous! She gave us service with a smile and nothing we asked was ever a problem for her. Our food and drinks were brought out in a timely manner and everyone enjoyed their dishes and tasty drinks! June is Margarita special month and we had plenty of those as well as some signature cocktails, all delicious!  We shared a few orders of the crispy ribs and Korean BBQ wings, those were amazing!! They kept my Bday cake in the fridge and brought it out at dessert time with a candle on top! So nice of them since we forgot candles!! I love Earls and we'll all be back soon!  Thank you for a wonderful Birthday Celebration!",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"We ordered the ahi tuna salad, kids quesadilla, wine and Korean wings.    The salad portion was small.   Considering it's mostly vegetables I don't get it.   The Korean wings were marginal.  The kids meal was really underwhelming.   For some reason we barely got any French fries and the apples were warm from being under the heat lamp.   I dont plan on returning.   It is really  convenient to Arclight theatre and the inside  has cool decor.",2,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
The outdoor patio was a great place to sit and have a drink and eat food.  Some neighborhood people brought their dog to the out door area which was nice.  Indoor seating seemed very cozy as well.  The food was excellent and cocktails were fun and very reasonably priced.  I will definitely go back.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Food was tasty but the service was almost nonexistent. Had to keep wrangling people to give our order to and the delivery wasn't well synchronized-for example one order of drinks came in 3 rounds. Food is tasty but took a while to get it.,2,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Had a great time (party of 8), the food was delicious, liked the ambience.  The only drawback was some of the steak was of lesser quality.  I had steak and sushi.  It was the tastiest dinner ever except for the sliced steak was some kind of cheaper sirloin, but it was really really deliciously spiced to go along with the sushi.  Loved it.  My husband's NY steak was fabulous, he said.  We took another couple to dinner and it ended up being quite pricey with cocktails but it was worth it.",5,LouiseS,Chicago
"Went on a date here before a Metallica concert..decked out in Metallica Tshirts so we wanted to find a place that was nice but not too fancy to where we would get weird looks. This place was the perfect mix of fancy and casual. The outdoor seating is very cozy and the service was very fast and polite. They went out of the way to make sure a meal we shared was on two separate plates. The food menu was fantastic, a mix of a lot of different foods so perfect for people who can't decide on just one thing. We had moscow mules and they were fantastic. I'd come here again in a heart beat.",5,OpenTable Diner,Indiana
"We met our family for Father's Day. We selected Earls because we have had good food and service there before. Food was good, as always. But the service became chaotic and our order was delayed and confused. First time we have experienced an issue with the service. But I will be going back for another try because we like the food.",3,Grandee,Chicago
"The host reported to open table that we were not there, though we checked in. We were seated but had no server assigned to our table. Not typical experience at Earls...",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Great time. Hostess and management was super accommodating when our ""patio"" reservations on Open Table didn't turn out the way we wanted it to be. Thank you!",5,teatimebarbie,Chicago
Anita and manager were both outstanding. Steak cooked perfectly! A kind adjustment to my husband's entree made it perfect. Really a good experience.,5,WestLoopHawkeye,Chicago
I made a reservation for 4.  A friends night out to catch up. We choose and outside table the service was great. The food and drinks were very good. I can't wait to go back soon.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Food was only average. Server suggested some things, none were great. The ""pan bread"" was awful. Horrid. We sent it back and they tried to heat it (aka burned it). No improvement. It was a tasteless hardened sponge. Drinks were over poured, so taste was terrible. Made several comments to the waiter. Nothing was done. A manager should have stopped by, but nope. Too many good places in the area to chance earls again.",3,KByum,Chicago
We were not able to be seated until 20 minutes after our reservation.    The waiter forgot to take the order for one of our guests at the table...,1,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Waited 40 minutes to be seated while 15+ tables remained empty during the entirety of our hour and a half visit. After being seated, it took another 15 minutes for a server to take our drink and food orders, after which the food took nearly 45 minutes. Hot wings were mostly bones, my salad was undressed, and entrees were overpriced for what they were. We left as quickly as we could.",2,Tori,Chicago
Service was beyond horrible.,1,Albl,Chicago
"We always enjoyed Earl's but the latest trip there really ruined it for us.  We had friends and family visiting that day and wanted to take them to Earl's. It was a beautiful day so we made a reservation for outside seating (Earl's has separate reservations for inside/outside seating on Open table).  We get to the restaurant and they tell us it will be a few minutes wait for our table. After waiting over 20 minutes they informed us that our table was ready and they lead us into the restaurant. I informed the hostess that we had requested outside seating. At which point the hostess tells us that outside seating will be another 30-45 minute wait. Then what is the point of separating seating on OpenTable if you're just going to seat people wherever the staff wants?   At that point the people in our party were too tired and hungry from a day of sightseeing to want to wait for outside seating. Once they get us to our table we get seated next to the bar, which is the loudest place you can be at. So holding a conversation with anyone was almost completely out of the question.   Needless to say my guests and I did not leave very happy with our experience.",3,Igloo1,Chicago
"Earls is a great place to eat whether its a date, a group of friends or a meal with the family. The signature cocktails are awesome, the curry reminds me of my time in Asia, and my wife can't stop ordering the Bibimbap! Portions are all sizable.  We also were made comfortable by management and staff with our kids' allergies to tree nuts and peanuts.",5,RogueFinancier,Chicago
We have been at several times and never been disappointed. We try new items for us every time we go there and have been never disappointed and and our servers are always great so as the service they give us.,4,Erinnut,Chicago
"Amazing service, amazing good, amazing place! Highly recommend it!",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"This is a solid choice of the New City restaurants to hit up before or after your movie. The drinks are good, and the food isn't bad, but some of the choices were a little lacking in flavor.",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Loved the back patio. Great for large groups. The food was great and so was our server!,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"The food was tasty but nothing to really come back for. Sushi (cooked) and steak combo was ok, but the meat, ordered medium rare, was chewy and hard to eat with just the chopsticks. My friends vegetarian Kung Pao was good. 5$ bloody Mary was ok, couldn't really taste any booze, and they were out of one of their specialty mimosas.",3,Klud,Chicago
"Service was really slow, but they made up for it by taking an item off the order. Curry was not as good as the waitress suggested. Salad was very good.",4,OpenTable Diner,St. Louis
The bacon cheddar burger was decent.  The new queso appetizer had good flavor but very greasy.,4,EdK8,Chicago
Thankfully another server fixed the issues but our food and coffee came out cold. We had to wait 15/20 min for someone to even pay attention to our requests. When everything was brought out the 2nd time the food was hot and plating was done perfectly. Wish it had just been the first time around. Not sure I would go there again for brunch.,3,IsaFoodie,London
Earl's is a fun place and i love the space but the food and service are iffy.  we had a terrible waiter.  had to practically beg for a waiter to attend to us and then it took 25 minutes to get drinks!  Some of our food was cold and had to be sent back to the kitchen.  The food was not as good as i remember it.  We were there for 3 plus hours to have a burger.   They really need to get it together,2,Rosie,Chicago
"My food was pretty good,  I had the Atlantic  salmon with rice and green beans.  The Clam  chowder was great and the peanut butter cookie with ice cream was also tasty. My husband's food wasn't as good, it was an Indian curry dish. Should probably stick with American food at this restaurant.",4,FoodSnob06,Chicago
"Didn't have any of there signature menu items on Mothers Day because they ran out by 430pm. Waited at the table for 15+ minutes before we were approached for drinks, although they seemed understaffed. Cool atmosphere, but steaks were ice cold, one of the worst cooked steaks I've ever had.",3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Love my whole experience! It was my first visit and was happy with everything. I will definitely recommend and be back. Loved the food, atmosphere, fire pits and the wait staff was the best!!!",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Great food, even better service. Very fun place! Their patio is awesome. Clam chowder is the best.",5,Janowsk,Chicago
"The food is ok, nothing special about that part....but the waitress we had was sweet and knowledgeable with the menu!   My family might be back, not sure if it that much worth it.",3,LessLee,Minneapolis
Amazing food and amazing service. Outdoors is great for spring and summer time,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Really enjoyed our dinner. The leek and potato flatbread could have been a meal by itself. Lamb chops were perfectly done as was the asparagus. Look through the entire wine list as those on the first few pages were pricy but there were more reasonable options towards the back. They need to add a nice Spanish cava as prosecco just doesn't cut it and the other sparkling wines by the glass were very expensive. Our only disappointment was the dessert selection. I rarely skip it but nothing here was a must have. Our waiter looked like Mark Consuelos' younger brother and was very accommodating with all my special requests. We will definitely go back.,5,G8rAna,Washington DC
"I had lunch here with a dear friend and it was one of the best meals I've had in a long while Suberb gazpacho, risotto, lamb, chicken and panna cotta. We had wonderful virgin cocktails with mint as well. The service was impeccable and they addresses me by name as soon as I walked in.",5,RedRedWine,Chicago
"After reading such a stellar review in the Chicago Magazine, we thought we would celebrate our special anniversary at Travelle.  We were disappointed in our dining experience here.  The hostess was gracious when she greeted us with anniversary good wishes.  The view was out to the parking garage - but the dining room was lovely.  The Mediterranean Portugal and Greece inspired was interesting, however the items we sampled were not on par with other fine restaurants in the city.  The suckling pig was fatty and tough.  The scallops tried to do too much with a combination of flavors.  The risotto WAS excellent.  Overall, we were disappointed and we will not return.",2,Tars,Chicago
"Excellent food that was universally loved by a group with diverse tastes and requirements (including vegetarians). Very helpful and friendly wait staff, good wine list, and an open, spacious ambiance with very well-controlled noise levels.",4,specracer,Chicago
"We generally steer away from restaurants in hotels, but on a work trip to Chicago decided to try Travelle. We are glad that we did. There were three of us, and we split a number of small plates and one entree among the three of us. All of the food was quite good, and the small plates afforded us an opportunity to taste six different dishes (plus two soups) before we were done. ",4,MichaelK,Washington DC
"I can hardly wait to go back to try the white tuna with sea urchin. Fabulous risotto with fresh peas and morels.  The seacuterie, chef's seafood take on chacuterie, was imaginative and fabulous, with octopus and tapenade, salmon terrine, scallop mousse, fresh rhubarb sauce, large capers, and whole grain mustard, plus charred bread, delicious! Whole grilled bronzino with charred asparagus and lemon was simple and lovely as a main dish. Elegant, understated decor with wrap around views.",5,NewCanisFans,Toronto
The noise level was so high you could not hear people talk across the table.  My entree was room temp upon arrival and I had to send it back.  Another guest at my table ordered soup and it was cold and had to be sent back as well.  I would not recommend this restaurant based on the experience I had.  ,2,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"I was actually highly disappointed in the service Open Table provided --- was trying to find reservations for 7 pm on saturday for five people, and, no matter what restaurant I searched, Open Table informed me that there are no reservation available other than 5 pm or 9 pm; I was forced to make a reservation earlier at Travelle for 5:15 pm. When we arrived to the restaurant, it was 90% available till 7:30 pm --- had I called the restaurant directly, I could ve made a significantly later reservation, which would have been way more convenient for all. ",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"We had an incredible lunch at Travelle.  The staff was extremely friendly and informative.  The atmosphere was terrific but most importantly, the food was delicious.  The lamb burger was out of this world.  It was hard to chose from the dessert menu because there were so many choices but we had the Nutella Baklava.  Too die for!  It was a terrific dining experience overall and I would recommend it for business or pleasure.  ",5,ColDan13,Chicago
"Really great food and drinks. Cool atmosphere with city views and kitchen in middle of restaurant with clear windows for full viewing. Really, really knowledgable and friendly hostess, waitstaff and servers. They go out of their way to make sure you're enjoying the food and overall dining experience. I will definitely be back!",5,Hardwl,Chicago
Room is very quiet and I enjoy the smaller portion sizes for lunch.  Cost is average but the dishes are unique (maybe too unique for a conservative eater) and the room is quiet enough for easy conversation.,3,Businesslunch,Chicago
"Lunch was perfect, Nicole at the front desk knew exactly what I wanted and the experience was awesome. From visit to visit though there are great differences in preparation but they generally are fantastic",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago

"My friend and I stopped in here for lunch the other day because I've been hearing amazing things about their burger and, since my tag line is ""burger inspector"", I figured I had to verify the claims about this creation. I was not disappointed. It was extremely juicy but had a nice crispy finish. The Mahon cheese (reminds me of Austin Mahone!) and the pickled onions brought some different bright flavors to the combo. There were also dried tomatoes, lettuce, and a secret sauce of some sort. I think it was a pepper aioli. The french fries were well seasoned and on the crispy side, just how I like them. Although it was pricier than my normal lunch, it was such a nice treat to enjoy a great hamburger. ",5,MsLoyel,Los Angeles
"Service was awesome, best Lamb burger ever , and salad was fantastic. This place is a gem.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"The food and service was outstanding. We were somewhat skeptical for breakfast, but were very pleased! ",3,ShaveyStraw,Chicago
"Always treated wonderfully and food was delicious , Evette at the front desk is spectacular at making me feel welcome. The only suggestion is that the waitress was a bit over the top in checking in to the point where conversations were interrupted too many times but she was still great.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Noisy not energetic.  Strained to hear dinner companion. Silverware clumsy.   Rushed service.  Annoying pretentious habit of waitstaff only addressing me throughout dinner, not my friend.  Ms.--- would you like,  Ms.--- may I take your order? We were two women dining.  Food only so so, main course not hot. Open table review site required a specific recommendation to process this review.  None applied.  But I had to click one.",2,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Travelle is an excellent restaurant but you do pay for this excellence.  I would recommend it, however, as a special occasion restaurant.   Also, must say the lobby and the bar are great - view is excellent all around.",4,Jude,Chicago
Terrific meal   Have recommend it to several  who have already  made reservations,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Excellent service and good fabulous kitchen scene great also in the bar area for a drink and appetizer,5,Debi,Chicago
"A total disappointment for a business lunch. Had to order three different bottles of wine due to being ""out"". Finally a white wine which the waiter overpoured. Ordered my entree which was also, ""out"" even though it was noon. Believe they put the wrong menus out. The Bento box lunch style was just wrong. Food was over salted. A horrible experience for such a pretty place. More disappointing is that the manager looked nervously on as the waiter had to tell us they were out of 3 selected wines and my entree. They should have made some accomodation. Will not return. ",1,Chitownfoodie,Chicago
"As a travel advisor, I am always looking for new hotels and restaurants for my clients.  Travelle is a real find.  From knowledgeable,  friendly servers that are highly attentive to an outstanding and very innovative menu, dining at Travelle is a wonderful experience. Everything that my party of four ordered is highly recommended; lamb chops in a yogurt sauce, gazpacho, soft-shell crab, risotto and a great selection of oysters in 3 different options called waves as an appetizer.  Get there early for cocktails and enjoy the great views in a sleek and artsy lounge.",5,OpenTable Diner,Los Angeles
"The best brunch of my life.   It was great for mother's day brunch, amazing place and the food it's outstanding.   Everythign in this place is beautiful, service, music, food, believe me everything.   HIghly reccomended for a romantic or special ocassion and for brunch.",5,Papitas,Chicago
"We were celebrating a big birthday.  Room and visible kitchen are great. Our Server was condescending all night, stopped by 10 min after our main course arrived. Didn't ask how things were, only said 'good, your food arrived' and left.  Restaurant has an odd habit of serving over the shoulder of the diner seated against the long banquette--this led to startling delivery of our wine glasses and a large spill of red wine at the table next to us. Piri Piri Chicken very good; Scallops cooked perfectly but poorly seasoned--just 'spicy' no Moroccan nuance. Small eggplants on side had inedible hard skin. We ordered Chocolate salted caramel dessert, delicious;but waiter brought a terrible cupcake 'for free' --insulting--no need to say 'free'.  ",2,Luvin5,Chicago
The restaurant had a great ambience. But the service wasn't too good. Had to wait a while for are waiter to come to are table and take are orders. And finally once we got are food we didn't see the waiter again till the end. We where also there celebrating a birthday that the restaurant was aware of and didn't get what we had asked for in a reservation. ,4,Chicagoeats,Chicago
"We enjoyed every dish (curry soup, beet salad, Piri Piri chicken, grilled octopus, baked cod, grapefruit brulee). They were also very accommodating.  Since my gf doesn't like artichokes, they substituted a medley of vegetables with the Cod. Overall, a very positive experience.  Oh, and i was stuffed walking out, so the portions were generous.  ",4,owenmeany,Chicago
"I hate reviews. None of it matters. What matters is the description; what you sensed, described succinctly. Watching our chefs prepare the blood-red merguez while drinking an '82 Bourdeaux was not any highlight. Biting down on a slice of fresh-baked, nasal passages are saturated with organic molecules releasing copious amounts of endorphins to get digestive juices ready. Ceviche clam soaked in cinnamon-licorice-bergammon spices spiked with pureed garlic takes away the nasty guilt trip from the crispy fried, quarter-pound bone-in porkchop, sides carmelized by the boar's darkened blood, smelling of lightly-burnt rosemary, the sting of lemon hangs the deadly dish in a delicate balance; life, death, wine, celebration. Highlights? Not needed.",4,Pelagius,Chicago
First time at restaurant. Excellent food and recommendations from waiter were fantastic. Had theatre tickets and made sure we were within our timeframe. Will definitely return. Appetizers that we chose were outstanding.  ,5,OPfoodie,Las Vegas
The suckling pig dish was not juicy at all and was too salty; the skin was too thick and not crispy at all.,4,OnlyTheBest,Chicago
"The menu is a tour of the Mediterranean with longer stops in Greece and Italy. The ""shareable"" section of the menu is unique, especially the pita balloon. The seafood selections were al very good. The nutella baklava and the chocolate terrine deserts are worth a visit in themselves. Excellent, well informed and friendly service. ",5,Buckthorn,Chicago
"I had very high expectations for Travelle and intend on returning, especially for drinks in the beautiful bar.  The service is top notch.  For the prices and reputation, however, I expected the dining room to have a much richer feel.  The ""open"" kitchen is a nice touch, but the cream banquettes were slightly stained and the overall feel was almost cafeteria-esque.  Also, the hangar steak was slightly underseasoned which is always unfortunate.   ",4,crispie,Chicago
Frequent diner in city.  Cost for 4 salads and non-alcoholic drinks $170!  Without tip!! Please?,2,Emgee,Chicago
"Great food with a wonderful eclectic menu. Service was outstanding on all fronts. However, the ambiance was like eating in an airport food court, too noisy, stark surroundings, and resembled a cafeteria. You can tell they spent a lot of money on decor and high end tables and chairs, but I don't think it comes together well. We went for a special occasion and it felt like we were having a great meal while waiting for our flight to be called.",4,Chewbear,Chicago
"Travelle I found to be wonderful. cozy seating by the window if you just want a bit of privacy and a drink with appetizer, or the energetic bar area for more engaging conversation , the kitchen is very nice centered in the center of the dining area all glass and steel full view of chefs in action. The servers very friendly and knowledgable about the menu. I would recommend this gem for full dining or just a appetizer and drink.",5,Debi,Chicago
"Service to food is always unique and just well made , had a great meal in a beautiful setting.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Very nice view and they knew all my favorites and had the table setup that way.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"It's a very splashy place with nice views and a nice bar area. The food was quite good but the service was disappointing. It was very casual, impersonal and a bit on the short side. Perhaps our waiter was overwhelmed. The available dishes were not nicely described. The wine brought to the table was not the one I ordered and luckily I caught that right away and got the right one. It was just an overall lack of finesse. And by the way, the washrooms were overdue for some routine cleaning.",3,Jaxon,Chicago
"Their braised beef cheeks, scallops, spiced acorn squash and chai cheesecake are all phenomenal and excellent choices!",5,Madeleine,Chicago
The octopus and the tar beef was excellent. Very disappointed with branzino.,3,Maggie,Chicago
"What a great meal!  We hit Travelle prior to the theatre and were looking for a quick bite - what a pleasant surprise!  The service was incredible, the menu interesting and without all the "" usual suspects"", and the food was INCREDIBLE.  Fabulous flavors put together in a way that was entirely different but utterly delicious.  Every shared plate was better than the last.  Great wine list with a large variety by the bottle or glass.  Loved the open and unbelievably immaculate open kitchen.  This is a must do!",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Well done. Nice choices, somewhat expensive however.",4,Mike,Indiana
Hotels don't often get much traction from the outside at their restaurants unless they're very good. But Travelle is very good and Ricardo served up very delicious food! that so impressed us we're excited to be returning this week.,5,HubHubb,Chicago
"Travelle has a new chef and he has introduced some options with a little more spice than previously.  Our server, Rodrigo, was excellent in recommending dishes to us and explaining the menu.  Overall the food was very good but a little too much salt was used for our taste and the main dishes were brought at a tepid temperature--whether that was intentional or not was not clear.  The beverage manager, Tomas, was very attentive and a pleasure to encounter and his wine list was extensive.  The overall experience was a pleasant one but it was greatly enhanced by the very amiable and knowledgeable staff, especially Claire and Tomas, without whom I think the meal would have been a tad disappointing.",4,GourmetAlba,Raleigh
"Went for an anniversary dinner date with the intention of having the Farmer's Market Tasting Menu (which looked delicious).  But when we saw the regular menu, we couldn't resist putting together our own ""tasting menu"".  We had the Burrata, Butternut Squash Pasta, Brussels Sprouts, Beef Cheeks, and Crispy Potatoes.  I don't have a single bad thing to say about any of it...everything was beautifully presented, rich in flavors, and delicious!  I would also like to state that the service (everything from the hosts to our server) was outstanding...so friendly and helpful - our server even kept us updated on the NLCS Cubs game throughout the evening, once he found out we were interested!  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for an elegant (and scrumptious) night out!  I know we would like to go back to try some of the things we couldn't fit in our tummies this time around!",4,pegasus,Chicago
The food and service were excellent.  The setting is very nice and my wife loved the fact that the server was able to serve her (she was sitting on the inside of the booth) and did not have to reach over me to serve or clear her dishes.  The noise is very loud and made conversation quite difficult for the 4 of us.  We would go back but would be somewhat reluctant given the noise level.,4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
This restaurant continues to be underrated. The beef cheeks and gnocchi were standouts. The pastry chef continues to amaze!!!!,5,RPM1,Phoenix
"Ordered a simple quinoa salad.  Turned out to be the best, freshest quinoa salad i ever had.  Watermelon gazpacho was excellent too.",5,Sunil,Chicago
"We went on a Wednesday night where they have a Farmers Market Menu. For $45, we got 4 courses of flavor packed, delicious food. Our Menu consisted of First Course: Roasted Fall Squash, Chamomile Poached Pears , Vadovan Pepitas, ricotta, Second Course: Seared Black Cod, Mushroom Consomme, Carmelized Bok Choy, Onion Oil, Third Course: Adobo Braised Pork Shoulder, Tomatilo Salsa, Habanero Picked Onions, Charred Poblano, Dessert: Chai Cheesecake, Pumpkin cake, Candied Kuri Squash, Walnuts.  The Cod was cooked to perfection. Everything was delicious.",5,polaris,Chicago
"I , and 5 of my friends, were at Travelle for Green Market dinner that happens on  Wednesdays.  Chef creates a menu from the market ingredients available that day. We had salad, fish, pork  and desert. Portions are tiny, so its more of a tasting menu. You really don't feel full unless you normally eat little. No bread. The food was tasty however. The pace of the dishes coming out of the kitchen was incredibly slow. The dishes were lukewarm at best by the time they reached the table. I am not sure what the cause of the delay was, as the restaurant was not that busy. Our waiter was pretty slow, and after I requested separate bills (which would only differ by drinks ordered as dinner is fixed proce), it literally took ages to get it back. Apparently,  the manager had to split the bill. The waiter was not paying attention to who ordered what drinks, so 2 bills we incorrect. Our dinner reservation was at 7, and we did not leave till 9:30, not because we were having such a great time, but because of kitchen/waiter delays. Though the food was good, I will not be back, as the whole event was disappointing.",3,Kate,Chicago
"We've been to Travelle several times and always have an amazing experience.  This time was the Green City Market tasting menu.  The $45 menu is excellent, seasonal and satisfying. The $20 wine pairings were excellent.  Service was fantastic, they even fold your napkin when you get up.  I will keep coming back to Travelle!",5,OpenTable Diner,San Diego
"Great ambiance and service, and a delicious farmers market 4 course menu, which is served every Wednesday.. also a great value!",5,damjan,Chicago
"Was there for our 39th wedding Anniversary with friends. Relaxing, great time.  We skipped the dessert  because we were full, but they surprised us and brought out 3 desserts as a gift for us to share.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Fine dining without the stuffiness. Excellent service, very flavorful dishes reasonably priced.",4,mjmtss,Chicago
"Pretty, quiet dining room with many healthy and tasty options for lunch.",5,Mary,Chicago
I go here because it is convenient to my office. The service and food are unpredictable. The add on salmon for my salad came in two portions are separate plates and the fish was raw.,3,guanabana,Chicago
"went with 4 friends to Travelle to check it out, and we were all very pleased with the place, esp the service and the generous wine pours.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Beautiful space to dine for a Saturday lunch. The service was wonderful and the food was delicious from the crab appetizer, our various sandwiches and dessert especially the peanut butter/banana.",5,DCvisitor,Chicago
We tried the chef's farm fresh menu and everything on there was fantastic.  My favorite was the arctic char that was cooked to perfection such that it melted in my mouth like no other seafood has before.  The beef cheek was super tender with a brown sauce that complemented it like the old school roast beef with mashed potatoes and gravy my mom used to make.  I also think you definitely need to try the choc doughnut - it was made fresh and came out hot with vanilla icecream and berry compote - we were so full and still wanted to order another one!!,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"I dined alone. Perhaps this influenced the service. I found the service sub-par and inattentive, the waiter argumentative. The wine list/cocktails are over priced for the level of restaurant. I went for dinner and I will try a brunch--just to be fair. All in all a mediocre experience.",3,ChicagoFatPiglet,Chicago
Handsome decor. Excellent service. Food not special.,3,Foodquest,Chicago
"In the beautiful Langham Hotel. A sophisticated but casual restaurant. Great for lunch, dinner and a nice drink at the bar",5,Newtoem,Chicago
Was there for a business dinner.  Everyone ordered different dishes.  I ordered the halibut it was delicious.  the portions were generous and the service was attentive without being disruptive.,5,breakfastlover,Washington DC
Had the market meal and it was wonderful. Great fresh foods prepared from market selected ingredients for a four course meal that day.  The servers were great and the chef came by to see how we liked the selections and the paired wines.,5,Jman,Chicago
"We were treated to such a lovely and special experience! Our server was knowledgeable and treated us to a special appetizer for our date night when he heard us debating about what to get. I would return for special occasions, date nights, and so much more! Wonderful ambiance and amazing food/ drinks, too!",5,Michele,Chicago
"Found out about this place through a Chowhound message board.  I think it goes unnoticed because it's a hotel restaurant. The quality of service, food, presentation exceeded our expectations.  Highly recommended.",5,Castelmar2,San Antonio
Great service and nice wine selection. Food was very average but everything was plated nicely.,2,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"The food was amazing and the service was excellent! My husband is not very adventurous and pretty much always ""goes with the chicken"". However, there was nothing boring about the spicy chicken he order at this place! The texture, flavors, and vegetable pairings were on point.  I ordered the fish special that was recommended by our server (I don't recall what kind) and was not disappointed.  Overall wonderful dining experience!",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Great farm to table menu on Wednesday. Great service.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"A wonderful, elegant and amazing experience - as usual. Started with Lyndsey going out of her way to check our needs before the experience and Peter following through at the table. This was a gift for a friend and we all agreed that this was once of the most amazing experiences and the food was unlike any other.   Everything was impeccable.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
We stumbled on Travelle Kitchen merely by checking for highly rated restaurants near our hotel in Chicago.  It was the greatest find!  We entertained clients who will never forget that evening.  The bar area and service there are impeccable including extensive (and some exclusive) offerings.  Every aspect of our meal was amazing.  It's difficult to recommend one dish. They were all prepared with great care and creatively flavorful ingredients.  One particular dish that was a hit with our table was the pork and muscles.  It was served in a broth that you could drink with a straw although dipping bread into it was equally enjoyable!  I can't say enough about this restaurant.  Just sorry I didn't get to go there a second time on that trip!,5,LScoble,Indiana
My wife and I celebrated our 37 wedding anniversary. It was our first visit to restaurant. The seating and food were perfect. I especially liked the way the waiter showed genuine concern for my wife's food allergy. The egg on a skillet was delicious.,5,OpenTable Diner,New Orleans
"Service good, however asked for entree without dressing and dressing was on entree when received.  Did not have time for them to remake.  Huge disappointment on such a simple request and such a high end hotel.  Also had to give direction on who was to receive what dish - would think this would have been better organized.",3,Lynn,Chicago
Great restaurant for foodies looking to have a calm evening with great views overlooking Chicago.  The ambiance is mellow and made our group feel relaxed while we nibbled on great food.,5,MplsEater,Minneapolis
Every bite and sip was outstanding. Kudos to the chef and dessert chef. This was a meal you didn't need to pretend to love.,5,SimChicago,Chicago
"The food was excellent, as was the service and the low-key, relaxed but elegant ambiance.  The only negative that the wine was quite expensive, especially by the bottle.  However,  it was worth the splurge.",5,Annabella,Chicago
"Beautifully designed restaurant in beautiful Chicago Hotel . Food was fresh ,delicious and creative .",5,gosia,Las Vegas
"Delicious, creative, imaginative menu. Service was impeccably good and friendly. The small plates for sharing are amazing (try the crispy octopus with pork belly) and the entrees are just as good. I had the most fantastic, perfectly cooked Halibut. My wife had the scallops with truffle sauce. Wine list has a great range and some really good values. Although set in a very chic hotel, the ambiance is bright, elegant, energetic, modern, not pretentious at all. Next door is the bar, with spectacular views. A great option in the loop. The downside is, it's across the street from the Trump tower ;)",5,Spice39,Chicago
"Had a fantastic breakfast! Ordered buttermilk pancakes and bruschetta eggs. The service was very attentive, food was prepared quickly and the result was incredibly delicious. We also received complimentary mimosas because of our anniversary, nice touch. Sat by window which offered entertaining view to city street (near Marina City). Lovely decor and lighting. Perfect for a quiet start to the day. Excellent experience, will definitely return.",5,Trath,Las Vegas
"We came back for the English benedict, ask for extra Hollandaise, 3 days later. Not crowded and a classier place to eat.",5,LausanneO,London
Great service. Had the Wabash Express option which all comes at once. Very good!,4,Asquared,Chicago
Wonderful experience. Recommending to all. Food and presentation were outstanding and made it a very special evening. Price was a good value for quality of food.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"The restaurant is beautifully designed. There was hardly anyone there on a Monday for lunch. The menu was all over the place with Indian, Italian, Greek. The theme of the restaurant wasn't immediately apparent, so we had to ask, and the answered left us more confused. Wait staff was okay, but the host who greeted us was awkward and distracted. The food was tasty: a friend and I shared the kale salad, an octopus appetizer, and the lemon risotto.  I hope they get their act together, because the location has great potential.",3,Betsy1212,Chicago
We entertained clients at Travelle recently and had a wonderful experience. The food was incredibly thought out and the service was excellent. The flaming chicken wings are a must have - incredible layers of flavor and perfect seasoning.  It was a bit quite the night we were there but overall we would definitely go back.,5,ChicagoBizTraveler,Chicago
"Went to Travelle after reading the review in the Chicago Tribune. The server was very knowledgable and made great recomendations, and the gluten free choices were plentiful. We had the kale salad and it was big enough for our group of four to have a nice small salad. The hanger steak was flavorful, but nothing out of the ordinary and if you are seeking a steak, there are probably other places to dine. The suckling pig was very good and was a recomendation of the server. The lamb shank was also very good. All of the Mediteranean menu items looked delicious and I think that the best way to experience Travelle is to order several tasting items or half orders from the Mediteranean specials and share with a group.",4,bfun,Chicago
"My wife recommended the Travelle for my 63rd birthday celebration. I was bit underdressed (having not thoroughly read the article from the Tribune that she gave me). None the less I was treated as a king by the serving staff. The food was well presented, delicious and unique. Our server was well acquainted with the exceptional wine list. The view of the river and Wabash is romantic and very Chicago. We will return and have already recommended our find to others. For the younger people the bar scene was was great.",5,Albert,Chicago
"Wonderful buffet selection for early morning breakfast. Loved the smoked Salmon, chilled shrimp, fresh fruit.",4,wineANDdine,New York Area
"Everything about Travelle is pleasing. The doorman who intuit your need instructions. The gracious greeting up front. The exquisitely designed mid-century modern interior, including views of the meticulous glassed-in kitchen. The professional and friendly service. And the exquisite, fresh, freshly conceived, and expertly prepared food! It was so much better in all respects than I expected, an upmaket value, and a welcome addition to the Chicago dining scene. Travelle also offers a great place for an after-work or after-theater drink. I look forward to returning.",4,Chicagofeedback,Chicago
Very special setting to have lunch. A perfect escape from the urban bustle yet still seeing the setting from a unique vantage point. A wonderful place to go for a drink or afternoon tea. A true treasure and asset to our city.,4,KPICK,Chicago
"After reading the reviews when Travelle opened, in the Tribune and Chicago Magazine, I thought, why bother? Both reviews led one to believe that the food was pretty poor at best. Our experience couldn't be more contrary. I'm guessing there's one experience for food critics, and one for the rest of us. We are considering the Langham for our daughter's wedding and wanted to check out the food before we commit. From beginning to end, pretty stellar. The service is impeccable, in the old school British manner. And the food good too! We loved the plates shared; octopus and hamachi. The chickpea fries should be tried! Loved them!",3,Karenlee53,Chicago
"Food -- delicious! Kale salad exceptional. So were the steak and lamb shank, tiramisu and nutella baklava  On the whole good service but not the top notch level that the Langham prides itself on. Dinner arrived and my champaign glass was empty but no one came and asked if I needed another drink. Didn't wipe out the bread crumbs from the table. Needs focus on the finer details for such a beautiful hotel.  The manager was great, very attentive and charming. However, the maitre'd (a woman) not very attentive. For instance when we were leaving-- she gave us our coats hurriedly. But was more interested in talking with her friend/coworker. This is definitely not the Langham Hotel standard for sure!",4,Bdaygirl,Chicago
Dinner selection was unique but delicious. Pricing was more than fair for a city place,4,Fooddude2,San Francisco
We dined here for our anniversary. My husband really enjoyed the kitchen that was enclosed in glass so you could watch the chefs at work. The staff was great. Very attentive and knowledgable. The food was fantastic. If you are a seafood lover this is definitely a place you want to check out.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Service in the bar (Kevin F) was phenomenal, as was Andrew in the dining room. The brussels sprouts were incredible, but the quality of the food overall was somewhat disappointing, and lacked flavor, and even the presentation lacked inventiveness for a high end restaurant.",3,CASmith,Chicago
How many hotels remember your favorite tea and have it waiting when you get to the table. Was meeting a business client here and that touch and respect made the whole meal amazing. Evelyn and the gentleman with her on greeting and our server were so professional and just plain excellent.  Try the Moroccan benedict - hard poached and just amazing health and perfect size breakfast. Some places are expensive for below average items and this place is not inexpensive but every dollar gets your the finest ingredients.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
One of the best meals we've had. The leek flatbread was to die for and the steak tartare perfectly seasoned and super fresh.  The presentations were fabulous. The server was always there at just the right moment. A bit pricey but worth it. Beautiful dining room and bar,5,pammy,Chicago
My wife and I decided to celebrate Valentine's Day on Sunday. This turned out to be the best option for us.  The team was extremely attentive to us. I felt like they had come to our house for a private dinner.  Thanks for some wonderful food and ambience.,5,Deadphish,Chicago
Great Food.... especially the variety for us vegetarians.... Carlos was a Great server... ambiance is like from a 60's restaurant... but the bar area was good...,5,Krx007,Chicago
"Ambience - nice/quiet w/o being silent. Food - pleasantly and surprisingly spectacular. If the meal we had is consistent with their everyday quality it's on par with the Michelin-star Sixteen across the street. The filet was incredibly tender &amp; cooked perfectly - red in the middle and juices retained w/o leaking. The fish with lobster sauce also cooked perfectly &amp; the sauce complements the fish nicely w/o overpowering it. Though the staff was cordial &amp; accommodating there are certain things I would not expect of a 5-star hotel restaurant. Our table needed an additional wipe down as part of it was sticky &amp; when they squeezed the blood red orange on the fish, some of it splattered on my wife's white sweater. Otherwise, good experience.",3,DKluvsfood,Chicago
"Travelle gives the diner the sense of being whisked away to somewhere else. The restaurant shimmers on entry and the food does, too. The food was spectacular, with phenomenal flavors and beautiful preparation.",5,MLucas0122,Chicago
"Another downtown hotel restaurant, rather out of the way. Nowhere near Michigan. Only a few diners were present on this weekday night. In spite of this, service was unenthusiastic and slow, distributed among several waiters, none of which seemed to know or care about us. As one might expect in an underutilized hotel restaurant, selection was not fantastic. Two types of oysters (we had to ask waiter their types). Fancy dishes, not very well pulled off. Suckling pig -- a good try. Appetizer cerviche -- left it on the plate. Desserts unexciting. Wine (malbec) was fine, but a little puddle in the gigantic glass. All in all, good place if you are ""hard up"" to find a place to eat in downtown Chicago. Doubt it is every busy.",3,Professor,Chicago
The lobby of the Langham hotel is beautiful but somehow they stopped the beauty once you enter the dining room. There was a feel of an upscale corporate cafeteria. The food was delicious. The service not so good. We waited over 15 minutes for the waitress to take our drink order and the restaurant was less than half full. We ordered a flatbread which never came.,2,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Visually, it's a lovely place. It's elegant, quiet. Had a drink at the bar first and liked that very much. The restaurant itself is quiet and a bit low energy. The kale salad was great, but you need to like kale. Also, a special flatbread with pickled mustard seeds and several cheeses and leeks was absolutely outstanding. It should be a regular on the menu. Their chocolate dessert was o.k., but not terribly exciting.Our particular food server was so good, I mentioned it to the manager. Yes, I would go back, perhaps for lunch.",4,MSJSL,Chicago
The food and wine were fabulous. It was a night to celebrate with friends so we splurged! Great time,5,Barb,Chicago
"Finally!! a Mediterranean restaurant that is not afraid to venture out of the typical Mediterranean items. The meal was outstanding and service to match. Prices are very approachable, don't be afraid that it is in a hotel, not a typical hotel restaurant at all. Falafel was the best I have ever had. Piri-Piri Chicken was amazing, one of the best half chickens in the city. Lots of great options to choose from. They are also making some great pastas from scratch, Boar Ragout Pasta is a must order. New Favorite Restaurant.",5,InTheBiz,Chicago
"My wife and I spent the weekend and the Langham hotel and one of the reasons was to try Travelle. The food was above average, but we just could not get over the space. Immediately when you walk in you notice how noisy it is. I am all for a noisy restaurant, but Travelle is intendned to be a bit more intimate. Secondly the lighting was brutal. There is a beautiful wine cellar but it is lit up like a Christmas tree. all of the harsh lighting then lights up the dining room. Add in the glass enclosed kitchen and you dont even need to have lighting in the dining...but they went ahead and added more lights.  Please get a lighting consultant to review the space. the bar space is beautifully lit so I know you can make the dining beautiful.",3,dprr,San Francisco
Beautiful restaurant but the food is only fair at best. Skip the restaurant and just check out the bar.,2,SouthSubReviewer,Chicago
"The food was great! Based on all the reviews I've read in the past, that was not a surprise to me. We had an octopus appeitzer along with the 3-item ""sea-cruterie"" - both were spectacular. My girlfriend has the lamb (fall off the bone, delicious!) and I had the seabass - perfectly cooked with an amazing cauliflower and hazelnut base. What did surprise me was simply how good the service was. Our waiter (Carlos) was very very friendly and knowlegeable. He was a true professional and also just a very friendly, enjoyable person.",5,OysterLover,Chicago
"With the blonde wood tables and large lights over the tables the restaurant felt too bright, like a cafeteria. Food and service were very good. I had the suckling pig, which was quite tasty.",4,Steve,Washington DC
"A sleekly soft, understated, classic dining experience with some global culinary overtones; The Langham's fine dining room mandates a starting cocktail at the chic riverview bar. Try the Winter. Our dining room, with its international style, features a beautiful glass box display kitchen as a backdrop. Our server had great menu knowledge and all his recommendations proved true upon delivery. Signature apps drumsticks- a flaming homage to Greektown, the lamb shanks and piri-piri half chicken were super. A side of sprouts need a little work, however the pastry department has a beautiful hand so both our treats were just that. They are currently without an official sommelier, but our the educated servers recommended a fantastic wine for us.",5,HostessMostess,Chicago
"Have lived in Chicago for 7 years and didn't know about this place until restaurant week but so glad we decided to try it. One of our new all time favs now! Service, ambiance, food, drinks all impeccable!",5,JustynaC,Chicago
"The Langham is a beautiful hotel. My only complaint with Travelle was the service. It was average, at best. It took over 5 minutes to get a cup of coffee and the restaurant wasn't even full. The waiter never asked if I wanted a refill and our dirty dishes sat at the table until we paid our bill. I will try it again because of the atmosphere and the menu was very extensive.",3,VALK,Chicago
"I have stayed at the Langham several times now since it opened and absolutely love this hotel. It is definitely my new favorite in Chicago. We have even ordered room service which was very good. So, I had expected Travelle to be at the same service level as everywhere else in the hotel. The food is very good, just don't plan to dine here unless you can have a very leisurely paced meal. Service is often very slow. I booked for a lunch meeting and arrived after my team. Was told that it took 10 minutes for them to get water and a menu. Not what I typically expect from Langham and felt bad after I had talked the place up:-) Fortunately the food was very good. It will be a great place once the service kinks are worked out.",3,JeannieR,Chicago
Seemed like the staff made a big effort to make you feel very welcome. Food was very tasty and great gluten free options!,4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Wonderful food, knowledgeable and attentive serving staff, but not overly so. The busier equally knowledgeable as the server. The server had extensive knowledge of the food AND the wine. Nice touch on having Chef Graham bring out the entrees'. Also note that the Sheree who met us was charming and attentive. Using my first name as a guest, but appropriately. Having our coats ready when we were leaving. The hotel itself was also stunning as we used the restrooms we got a look at the tea room, the bathrooms. Finally, as we left, we walked through the lounge which we will visit in the future. Great view of the Chicago River and nicely appointed.  Truly, one of the best restaurants this year I visited. Exceeded expectations.",5,Womanoverboard,Chicago
"I found the menu offerings uninspired and frankly average. For the price and location I had high expectations, I was met with food that I could have made myself and would have enjoyed more. The service was terribly slow, the waiter needed 20 minutes to process my credit card to complete the bill. This was after only seeing him to place the order, he didn't bring the food, didn't check in to ensure everything was good and didn't provide refills. Overall I was completely disappointed and will not be back.",2,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
"Absolutly the best meal i've ever had. Was there on superbowl night, so it was pleasantly very quiet. Service, which we consider a veryimportant part of dining experience, was professional, very well trained, invisable except when needed and then attentive. A huge must to try. Ted Thompson.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Great service. Formal but friendly. Great food. Nice spacing between tables. Conversation friendly. Nice find for restaurant week.,4,atwoodfan,Chicago
"Decided to try this hotel spot for lunch during restaurant week - still trying to find that awe inspiring meal….. well, this was pretty great! tables were uncomfortably close together but enjoyed speaking a bit of french with our waiter before enjoying the amazing squash soup, risotto and choc dessert. the portions were just right not too big and not too little. would love to come back and try out the very cool looking bar at sunset or later.",4,36whitelands,Chicago
I tried the Langham's Restaurant Week menu and was very pleased. Each course was delicious and the service was great. I can't wait to go back.,4,Beverly,Chicago
"Tried out the restaurant for lunch during Restaurant week. The portions of the food were small, but not sure if they are always small or because it was restaurant week. The dessert was amazing. I had the chocolate, hazelnut, caramel torte - delicious! I would definitely go back for high tea or dessert and wine. The Langham hotel is beautiful. I used to live next door and I'm disappointed that I moved.",4,ChicagoRN,Chicago
The food here was excellent! Such amazing combinations. Chef Tim Graham is very creative and you will find Travelle worth a visit. A restaurant you can treat as an experience not just a meal.,5,OpenTable Diner,Philadelphia
"This place hasn't been open very long, and when we came in for a birthday lunch during restaurant week, it definitely felt young. The staff were friendly and helpful, but didn't seem very knowledgeable about the restaurant week menu- which is only 6 items long. The meal itself was tasty. I had the Char on the most amazing bed of spinach. It was so garlic-y and really grounded the lighter fish. The the mustard-seed salsa thing on the side brought the brightness. In short, it was a very balanced plate. The soup and dessert were also very well thought out and balanced. A few people said serving sizes were small, but I thought it was the perfect amount for lunch.",3,birfdaygirl,Chicago
The service is attentive and the food is excellent! It makes a great destination when you want to feel pampered and enjoy your food and company.,5,MPatM,Chicago
"I have been here 4 times and each time the service was excellent and try some of the unique benedicts for breakfast, the portion sizes are reasonable and the fresh carrot juice is really good, way better than the ginger apple cider.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"we asked to come in 45 minutes earlier of our reserved mealtime-and it was a yes! restaurant was busy. dishes were presented just right and simply beautiful! we enjoyed the chorizo bignets, beef benedict and the perfectly temped fish. dessert was skimpy but was wonderful! staff made us feel so welcome. casual ambience fit for foodies; nothing pretentious. we shall return- very soon!",5,lynne,Chicago
"Just amazing place at night, food was so good and service knew when to step in and when to leave us alone.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Pico chicken was very good , the seachauterie plate, service was excellent",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"I meet monthly with a group of women, all professionals that love great food. This was our first visit to Travelle. Beautiful dinning room, nice live music in the bar , yet on the 6 degree night was a bit cold.  Generous salads were nicely presented and the staff accommodated our request to share. One of the choice fish entries was not available, but our selection was good. Possibly a tad over cooked, but nice preparation with mustard grains and tangerine.  Wonderful selection of interesting wines by the glass, and after dinner teas and coffees.",4,Artling,Chicago
"The restaurant strives for excellence in every aspect. The food was very good, especially the "" Forest Mushrooms"" Tagliatelle dish. Vegetarian. The wine list is very nice. Love the decor, simple, elegant. The bar is fun. On Thursdays and Fridays there is a two person band ( one is singer) playing jazzy music. You cannot beat the view, of course, of the city at night !!",4,Grace,Chicago
"From the arrival at the ground floor of the IBM building to the walk through the stunning Langham Hotel, going to Travelle is also a feast for the senses.Travelle on the other side of the floor is casual and chic in the best Chicago tradition. The service was superb and you get to watch the chefs at work through a glass wall. the views are classic Chicago but Marina City can be a little grubby on a winter's day. Better is the view in the bar area of the Chicago river and the promenade. The lunch boxes are a great deal and I had one of the best risottos I've ever had. The waiter was good humored and made it very breezy and casual (while still professional). My new favorite lunch spot in the city.",5,RedRedWine,Chicago
Tasty brunch in a nice room with mimosas. Great way to start a Sunday.,4,AAaa,Chicago
"We had an enjoyable lunch at Travelle. We started at the bar, which was a GREAT experience. Great specialty cocktails, great view, and the bartenders were very friendly and accommodating. Lunch was just okay. Probably wouldn't go back for lunch since the weekend menu is limited to a small lunch selection. The waiter treated us to a birthday dessert...the espresso cheesecake was yummy!",3,Thought4Food,Chicago
"We very much enjoyed our dinner at Travelle on Saturday evening. The space is lovely, the food was very good but we were most impressed with the service. From the hostess to our waiter to the wait staff in the bar - impeccable! It truly made the evening special.",4,Mars,Chicago
"I loved every bite I had at Travelle, and the ambiance was quite lovely. I loved the coriander beet salad, the lamb shank, and the grapefruit dessert. Yum! The waitstaff was very attentive, but they tried to swipe my dessert wine glass 4 times before our waiter had a chance to fill it with wine! Overall, lovely experience!",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"From ambiance to the service, from the delicious menu to the outstanding wine selection, Travelle exceeded our expectations. I travel extensively and enjoy fine dining all over the country as well as abroad…I would put Travelle up against any restaurant outside of the absolute top tier establishments in any city! Cant wait to go back!!!",5,Mark,Chicago
"As many other reviewers have previously stated, the food is the weak link at Travelle. It was bland, boring, disappointing, and served tepid; I expected more from Tim Graham's kitchen. That said, a fantastic place to ""Rent a Table"" for the evening and people-watch.",3,hamiltonwatch,Indiana
"I picked this restaurant for my birthday dinner after reading lots of great reviews, including the Chicago Magazine hot list that spoke of the amazing views. I was disappointed to find my amazing window seat view was of a street and parking deck - turns out the views are from the bar, not the restaurant. The food was really great, except a poor suggestion to try the char (that was really awful) but the restaurant completely made this up to us and all the other food brought to the table was wonderful. It was a good experience, but we would not send friends/family here for dinner. Drinks at the bar, though, would be a great spot here.",3,winnetkamom,Richmond
"Booked a reservation here  because it was close tot the theater we would be attending later in the evening.  we ordered several small plates and all of them were delicious.  Service, Food, Ambiance was all very good.  I'll go back.",4,Kevin,Chicago
"The menu is a departure from other restaurants. The food was delicious, great cocktail and wine list, and we could converse with our friends over dinner. The service was excellent. We look forward to returning to this fine new restaurant.",5,Madge,Chicago
"Confession: when we first sat down and looked at the menu we decided to leave. We didn't see enough that interested us. Then the server told us about the specials and we stayed. I'm glad we did because we had an excellent meal. The background is that we stayed at the hotel for two nights. We ate the standard hotel breakfast at Travelle that morning so we were dubious about dinner. We had an excellent and creative beef tartar, followed by a generous and reasonably priced tagliatelle with parmesan and half a white truffle shaved on top (the chef came out himself to do the honors). That was followed by a vegetarian eggplant special that was very unique and creative. All in all an excellent meal. Creative, great tastes and reasonably priced.",4,HadAGreatMeal,Chicago
"I loved my most recent meal at Travelle. The kitchen has rapidly improved since my first visit shortly after they opened. The menu is a little more focused, and everything we ordered was delicious. Next time I hope to dine at the chef's table for the ""la dolce vita"" menu. Chickpea panisse are a must-try snack, like the lovechild of French fries and polenta. Really enjoyed the arctic char and the grapefruit ""pithivier"" for dessert was a light and fun option. Lots of components, but it all worked well. They have an excellent wine list as well, very impressed by the geographic diversity. Most of all, though, the service is fantastic and they anticipate your every need, from purse hooks to pulling out chairs the instant you want to get up.",5,Amber,Chicago
Great place to relax and enjoy somew interesting entertainment. Good cocktail and wine service.,5,GKonie,Chicago
The service is top notch and the chef is fabulous ! The restaurants atmosphere doesn't match the quality . Having a view of the kitchen is cool but the ambiance of the restaurant reminds me of a typical hotel lunch room. I would suggest adding table cloths to dress up the room. The bar is beautiful and the tea room off of lobby should be the dining room. Bottom line is the food is creative and will be back again but please add table cloths!,4,Luv2dine,Chicago
"Best way to summarize our recent dining experience is the following: excellent service (exceptional, really), impressive wine list and great cocktails, but the food left us wanting more for our money (and time). The $35 lobster risotto was sour (too much lemon juice perhaps?), too salty (to many parmigiano crisps?), too runny and the green olives should be eliminated. The suckling pig was good, but there was hardly any meet. Again, they should loose the olives (this time they were black). We did enjoy our appetizer (pita balloons) and salads (beet and kale) and dessert was nice too, but the entrees left us disappointed.",3,LuckyTangerine,Chicago
"Great menu -- has vegetarian options, which I really appreciated. The food was delicious, and the service attentive without hovering. Just right! Very enjoyable dining experience all the way around.",5,DJM1244,Atlanta
"Travelle, in the Langham Hotel, is just right. The design is great, food outstanding and service was perfect. Can't wait to go back.",5,twroths,Chicago
We were greeted in a lovely manner and the hotel in general is stunning...clean lines yet not cold. Our server seemed bit awkward and did not approach table for about 10 minutes...he did apologize however and his service was efficient. Manager stopped by and was quite efficient...not really warm...but pleasant. A second server stoppd by and was the antithesis tothese other two..warm lovely and engaging. Overall a nice brunch food was very imaginative and tasty.,4,Mark,Chicago
"I was so excited to try Travelle especially after reading it waslisted as one of the 10 hottest restaurants. I now think that must have been a marketing ploy. It was a beautiful bar and view. However our dinner was not good. The emulsified olive oil on the table didn't translate very well with the bread, we order the octopus which was chewy and the caponata...it didn't go. There was also a dessert we ordered, it was the white chocolate mess. It tasted as if it was in the refrigerator too long, and the feta cheese and sesame seed sugar did not complement it well... Not to mention the waiter was sarcastic. I will not be dining there again. I will say, the Nutella baklava was out of this world... So all was not lost on a $400 dinner.",2,Eatatniceplaces,Chicago
"Atmosphere was trying to be minimalistic chic, but just reminded me of a Holiday Inn restaurant. Food was creative in approach - but not overly outstanding in flavor. Caesar marine salad - fried smelts with bacon on a Caesar salad - should have been amazing. But the salad dressing had no garlic/lemony flavor, just bland nothingness, bacon was wilted &amp; greasy (undercooked) and smelts were over-fried. My entree, the hangar steak &amp; bagna cauda, was delicious, but the steak came out luke warm and just got cold by the third bite. Left half of it on the plate, although it tasted great while it lasted. Server was nervous and a fast talker, just not a pleasant experience at all. Staff was friendly and tried hard to please (my steak was comp'd).",3,TrishtheDish,Chicago
"The attitude of the employees may be the most positive I've seen anywhere. The decor is light-hearted contemporary. With a modern twist to Mediteranean cuisine, the chef has managed to come up with many very original dishes that are almost like comfort food. Portions were a healthy size without spilling over the edges of the plate. We shared a 3-flight cheese course, the pita balloon and red pepper dip, and then each had our own entrees and desserts. It was just the right amount of food. Delicious! Our server was very knowledgable and eager to assist. The Nutella Backlava was out of this world! We are anxious to return to Travelle. It was a delightful night out. Terrific food, without taking themselves too seriously. Can't wait to return.",5,SueF,Chicago
"The entire restaurant lives and dies on the fact that its in a hotel. The food is fair at best, mass produced, and flavorless. Wine pours are pathetic.  Would never go back, and will never recommend to a friend.",1,AParks,Chicago
Lovely find for late night as well as possible dancing. Very loungy but also can be upbeat. Great food and definitely something different,5,antonovaval,Chicago
Birthday fun,3,OpenTable Diner,Minneapolis
"Great food, and ambience!  Small plates are way too small for price.  Do not go there hungry or you could drop a small fortune.",3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"I was very excited to have dinner at Boleo because they had amazing reviews, but I was quite disappointed. The place is beautiful, the cocktails were good, the food was okay, but the portions were RIDICULOUS. The food menu is very limited, they have only like 10 options and for what it is, it is overpriced. The tuna and the ceviche were okay, but I literally ate it all in three bites. I would only recommend Boleo for a few cocktails. The waitress was very nice.",4,Mariana,Chicago
Great venue. Food was good but very small portions for the price.,5,OpenTable Diner,Minneapolis
We stopped here after the theatre. It is a lovey setting. Our drinks were amazing!  We tried a couple of small plate items and they were both very good. The best was our waiter Nick!  He moved a table for us so we could have a view out the glass roof into Chicago. It was a very nice jester. He also brought up complementary Champaign. We were celebrating our anniversary. Each time he came to our table he had a smile on his face!  The whole experience here was a wonderful ending to our anniversary day!!!,5,DeeCN,Chicago
Everything we tried was amazing.  The Chef even made us a specific dish based upon his appearance on Beat Bobby Flay.  Can't recommend it enough.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"I proposed to my now fiancé at Boleo, and I could not be more complimentary. They were incredibly helpful and accommodating, they worked with my friends to position everything for pictures (unbeknownst to my fiancé), and they provided great service throughout our time there. I always want to spend my money for good people, and I will definitely be back here.  Also, the prices were great and ambiance/décor was great. I did not eat here, but I am excited to.",5,Daniel,Raleigh
"Food selection was very limited. Food tasted great, however expensuve for what is provided, not good for a meal. Drinks and atmosphere is great for lounging and socializing.",3,Jeff,San Francisco
"Our family of four enjoyed a great early dinner composed of small plates before heading to see Hamilton.  All of the staff (maitre'd, server, multiple bussers) was very friendly and stayed right on top of everything to help us make sure we finished in time for the show.  The menu is rather small, but has fantastic variety from ceviche (my favorite) through melt-in-your-mouth steak (big hiyt with my son).",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Food was great, service not so much. I would recommend going during the summer when they presumably have more wait staff (and the roof is open).",3,EV5020,Washington DC
Great restaurant! We celebrated our 2nd anniversary. It was our first time at Boleo. We got very romantic table in a quiet place. Our waiter was very helpful and fast. He explain for us all menu and was is the best. The food was very delicious as well as cocktails. Definitely we have to go there one more time!,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Amazing drinks, great food, awesome service!",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"The food was interesting and delicious. Our waiter, Nicholas, was wonderful and made the experience accessible and fun. We had our teenage boys with us and they loved the whole experience, as well. We will definitely be back as a family in the summer to enjoy the rooftop dining!",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Great spot for happy hour tapas/dinner before a show!,4,Bean111,Louisville
"I found the food creative and delicious, especially the dishes recommended and / or served by the chef. My friend and I really enjoyed being able to choose from the tasting / tapas menu and the combination of ingredients in each dish was phenomenal. We each had two mezcal cocktails (Abuela), which we both really enjoyed. However, while I thought the pour was generous, the alcohol content could have been a little higher.",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Amazing place to eat. Everyone was so nice and attentive. Food was fantastic and the drinks are to die for! First time here and I will be coming back!,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Friendly staff and great food.,4,OpenTable Diner,Denver
"Service, cocktails, and decor were great. Food was mediocre.",4,JayC,Chicago
This place is amazing! Great cocktails and really good food! The ambience is beautiful! I highly recommend it!,5,Fina,Chicago
"I will say that the service was excellent. Really top notch. But the noise level was out of control. Could not hear anything at my table of 4 people which really made it a frustrating evening for such an expensive dinner.  My Tuna appetizer was delicious (deconstructed Nicoise salad) but a bit salty  My boar pasta was mixed. Pasta tasted fresh, but the boar was incredibly tough.  Deserts were good and the drinks were good.  Can't say I'd hurry back .... it's a new ""see and be seen"" place so I think that the food is secondary... which is too bad.",3,David,Chicago
"The Langham has done an excellent job in this fine dining, get not stuffy atmosphere. The menu is very creative and will tantalize your taste buds, The waiter Andrew obviously new the food and even the wines by the glass. Having said that, the sommelier, Richard, has created a first class wine list with priece points for all. My dughter is a foodie and thought this was one of the best restaurants she had ever been to. To sum it up, top notch food and wine as well as attentiveness by all. We live in Chicago and will be back.",5,Educatedpalate,Chicago
They had a couple of larger tables but we waited a good amount of time for anyone to come to the table. All of my other experiences have been great...an off day perhaps?!,3,Jeremy,Chicago
"The service was attentive. Great space. The decor was modern, chic and and comfortable. Our group thought it might be pricey but we were pleasntly surpried to find reasonable offerings. We had the sausage flatbread which was delish. We also had the saganaki wings which were just ok. The mixed greens salad was huge and could be enough for two people. There was some interesting dishes like a boar meat ragu pasta which was tasty. I suggest they expand out their menu. Overall very good.",4,local,Chicago
"The service from entry to finish was excellent. The menu took some explaining but in the end great choices were made. the food was very delicious, well prepared and thorough.",4,SDM424,Chicago
"We enjoyed our dinner at Travelle. The service was outstanding from the minute we walked in the door until we left. Only wish the food had been up to the level of service. While the food was good, it was not as good as the service. Suckling pig seemed like it was the rib from a larger pig, though it was delicious. Every other dish was tweaked to just beyond where it needed to be. Less is more! Overall, an enjoyable experience. Superbly comfortable dining room with view of the kitchen and, as mentioned already, fabulous service!",4,Happycooker,Chicago
Travelle is now in the Top 5 for my favorite restaurants and this includes places like NYC &amp; Napa etc...,5,Charly,Phoenix
Met three friends there for birthday dinner. Bartenders knowledgable friendly generous with tastings til we found our wine. Hostess lovely. Wait and wine staff attentive friendly. Food delicious portions reasonable. Only con was wine list too focused on hi end. Puts entire restaurant into expense account territory for me. Too bad I don't have one. Was happy to find great by the glass.,4,Birthdaygirl22,Chicago
The bright florescent exposed kitchen gives this otherwise sophisticated space a cafeteria feel. Food was very good and service was very poor. Hopefully they will improve and we would try it again.,3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"I didn't realise it was going to be so loud at 7:30pm, we were unable to talk without shouting but the food was flavourful and our server was very sweet.  The atmosphere and open roof made it feel very club / dance like. Which is perfect for after dinner drinks and dancing.  Luckily my nearly 80 year old Mom said it was an experience and could turn her hearing aids down.",3,Suzy,Chicago
"Expensive drinks for what you get, the cocktails were watered and iced down. My cocktail only had few sips since it contained 90% miniscule ice. Unknowledgeable waitress, she could not answer some of the questions we had about the menu. We ended up saying that we will google it. The ambiance was okay but it was empty on a Friday night. Overall unimpressed, we will not come back or recommend to anyone.",2,YSKT,New York Area
"Food was pretty good but had issues with service. Several times our waiter (Jason) just disappeared. Finally we asked for our waiter from the busboy and another  came and took our next order. We asked what happened to Jason and she said he was on break. No other explanation, no apology he was probably on  Break for at least 30 minutes.  funny thing and all this was the result two other tables that were having dinner at that moment. Bottom line, pretty good food, spotty service and the music was much too loud.",3,OpenTable Diner,St. Louis
"We had just gotten back from a trip to Peru and were excited to try some of their small plates. The food was very pretty, but didn't taste very good. Almost everything was bland. The cocktails were great and when the roof opened the fresh air was very nice.",2,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Excellent service and interesting, amazing food. Smaller portions. Great cocktails!",5,AshM,Chicago
This place is a hidden gem in the loop!! First time dining here.  Great experience! Food and service was excellent. Setting was perfect  at this rooftop bar with a Latin band. Drinks &amp; tapas were delicious. There were even a couple unexpected happy hour specials.   Molly was our waitress and was terrific in describing  all dishes (small plates). Made my friend's birthday extra special. Will definitely be back!,5,Lak6300,Chicago
"We had a great dinner at Boleo. We stayed for the featured DJs in the later evening. Beautiful crowd made for great people watching. Molly was an awesome server with delicious recommendations for food and drinks. I'd recommend the arroz chaufa, maybe two bowls.",5,OpenTable Diner,Washington DC
The Boleo is breath taking and the food was delicious and the service was equal to the taste of the food.  Can't wait to return.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"This was the second time we have been to Boleo and have enjoyed both times.  Love the food, love the DJ, love the drinks!",4,pcdiner,Indiana
"Loved the rooftop Bar. I meet there with my friend who came and visit from Mexico, We loved Rice it was delicious and all the handcrafted drinks. Note if you order pisco sour note that it has raw egg.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Boleo? More like Bole-whoa. This was my first time coming here for a dinner date. I was a bit unsure at first if this would be a good date spot since my first 2 times here were late at night and the music was super loud. However, coming at dinner hours, it was just right. Although the first two times I was here I enjoyed the energetic, live music! The service was wonderful. The authentic Peruvian dishes and a rotating list of creative, hand-crafted cocktails make a perfect combination and the environment provided a unique experience with the retracted roof as the sun set over Chicago.",5,TalaSol,Chicago
"I have been to Boleo a couple of times and I haven't been disappointed.  Energetic atmosphere, inventive drinks and wonderful food.  The food is small plates so you can try a variety of items.   The noise level it a bit high so don't go there for an intimate evening, but it does have a romantic/sexy vibe.  Added to all of that, is the open-roof with great views of the surrounding skyline.  Very unique and something to be experienced.",5,kaba,Chicago
"Not great food, ambiance was nice.  The menu is minimal so you may want to eat a bit before :)",3,OpenTable Diner,Orange County
The absolute best octopus I've ever had in my life! Came in for the new Tropical Disco programming every Wednesday night and I was blown away.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Lousy service. Noise was unbearable. Several tables complained about the noise. Save your money and go to a real food/bar scene,2,James,New York Area
"Amazing service, beautifully decorated and every single dish stood on its own w delicacy and full flavor.",5,OpenTable Diner,Miami
The food was mediocre... we ordered from the happy hour menu... waiter said that the chicken kabobs were very hot however they were luke warm at best... we ordered the happy hour special of empanadas at 806 and when they were brought out we were informed that they would not be included in the happy hour pricing.  When ch is fine but maybe they should inform us when we order?   The music was great... service was slow,2,Chidiner,Chicago
"Boleo is a hidden gem in the city.  Great food and cocktails at a reasonable price.  Good place for all kinds of things.  Saw coworkers in large groups there, some of the space was rented out for a company.  There was a DJ then live music but not overwhelming.  Rooftop also although it was too cool for it the day we went.  Definitely recommend if you're downtown or before going to a show.",5,Chris,Chicago
"Great restaurant. The ceviche and the tiradito were amazin, and the cocktails too. A little bit expensive, but worth it.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"The waitress seemed to be busy tending to other guest,however she did sporadically check in on us... but a different waitress brought our food out and when I notified my waitress of a problem with my order she told me due to cross contamination she couldn’t correct it 😕",4,DeAnthonyM,Chicago
Family birthday,4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
The price for the wings has gone up so much and they put restrictions on them if want to try different flavors. We ordered 20 and had to switch to 10 each to get the flavors we wanted. When you order 10 it is actually 5 full wings and that is starting to be a rip off.,3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
The bathrooms were the most disgusting bathroom I have ever been in.  I can not believe that women can be so disgusting throwing toilet paper and used Feminine products on the floor.  After telling the manager multiple times they were still only somewhat picked up.  Never were they clean. The manager seemed to be indifferent when I told him.,3,MaryB,Chicago
The service at the table was fine but getting a table was a joke! What was the point of making a reservation at 6 when we didn’t even sit down until after 6:30. That was after going up to the hostess twice to find out what the problem was. The hostess was rude and had no explanation but just kept saying we would be next. We had small children with us which is why we made a reservation ahead of time so we wouldn’t have to wait more than a few minutes. Guess we were wrong!!! Won’t be going back here unless someone gets a clue!!,3,LH14,Chicago
When we arrived they didn’t even have our reservation. The fryers need to be changes because the food was dark and tasted burned. There wasn’t any sauce on the wings that we had to ask for extra sauce.,3,samantha,Chicago
Our burgers were cold and the bun was old and super dry. I was very disappointed,2,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Our drinks and soup came reasonably soon, but we waited nearly 75 minutes for wings and a burger. The wings were cold and the burger well done and dry. We were told phone orders of 100’s of wings was the hold up. Next time we’ll phone our order in from the table and maybe we’ll be served quicker. 😉",2,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Reserved  a 730 reservation for 10 people after holiday activities with another family.  Arrived at 720 to let them know we were there. We did not get seated until 820 and they split our group in two sections on each side of restaurant.  Service was quick and friendly. However,  we ordered crab legs,  fries,  and wings; all three items came out cold and did not taste good at all.  After the stress of the day and waiting to get seated,  I ordered a margarita,  surprise, surprise... the drink was watered down.  I understand the place was busy,  but I have been a patron of this restaurant a long time and this was unacceptable!",1,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Great place can't wait to go back,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Our open table reservation was booked for 6:00.  We arrive in time, there are four hostess of which are sooooo unorganized.  We got seated at 6:45.  Not happy but wanted wings and some shrimp.  The hostess called people who have been seated 10 minutes ago.  Need some management to step in and organize.",2,Nancyod,Chicago
It took an hour to get our food. I know things can be busy but that just seems a little too long for 2 orders of wings.,2,OpenTable Diner,Chicago

One of my fav,4,tiffany81,Chicago
"was a little surprised we still had to wait even though we had a reservation made using Open Table.  The hostess was not that friendly, might have been stressed as it was busy.  Should have someone more experienced that can handle a crowd.  Other than that service and food were great.",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Food was good I was seated in mannerly fashion  I like this restaurant,4,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco

Always visit this location and always received good service and wings. A must try if ever in the area if like Wings....,3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago

"Great service,",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
The service and the food was bad on Father's day.  I was really disappointed the food and service usually are much better.  It took almost an hour before we got the food. My crab legs were cold and I sent them back it took another half an hour and they brought them back burnt. I have never seen a brown crab leg. Called the manager over and she was not helpful she asked if I wanted more crab legs. Are you kidding me? My family was almost done eating so I didn't want to order more food to come back wrong.,1,KelliW,Chicago
"We visited on Father's Day and were greeted promptly upon arrival.  I told them I had a reservation and we were quickly escorted to our table!  We ordered wings, tater tots and a few drinks.  Katy was our server and was very friendly and quick with our requests!  I have visited this restaurant several times and have always had a pleasurable dining experience.  We will be back again in the not too distant future!",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Hubby had a nice family outing for his birthday not too crowded and the wait staff was nice,4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Good service,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Service was good. The waiter that waited on us was prompt and patient throughout our time there. However, on numerous occasions, the food we ordered was cold. On our last visit, when we spoke with the manager, he stated that the food was cold because they were in need of cooks.  It's 2 weeks later and the same situation is still occurring. I had to order my food three times before receiving freshly made wings. This is disappointing, as I've always had good quality food there before and wouldn't expect less. This is why I return to this Hooters and not the other establishments. I've been going here for more than 4 years. Please correct this.",2,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
It was wonderful . Everything about the service was nice .,4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
We had 14 people in our party we were able to Make a reservation on open table we were seated  When we got there server was great we will return  To this location soon,5,FedExman,Chicago
This was the worst experience I've ever had at this location. And I've been coming here a lot. One of the managers that took me and my friends drinks order ignored us while we were trying to request another drink. Appetizers took forever and were cold. And we didn't receive our food for two hours after we got seated.  &amp;&amp; since the waitress couldn't explain how to split up the checks so everyone would pay for their own meal. 3 people were stuck with a bill in which we had to pay extra for.,1,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Hot wings, cold beer, and plenty going on all around us. Good time.",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Great customer service. Thank you for everything. We will be there soon again.,5,OpenTable Diner,Edmonton
Good food and lots of TV  perfect to watch the playoffs,5,KelliW,Chicago
Food wasn't great. Server didn't really do much to keep us happy.,2,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Sat right away at a table too tiny to have plates for 30 wings and fries. Never got the fries we ordered. Drinks came slow and food took over an hour. Wings were typical of Hooters.,3,OpenTable Diner,Phoenix
"In a nutshell...the hostesses had no clue what they were doing. Our waitress was pretty as, she  came to the table twice to apologize for our food taking forever, and then she would disappear for 15 minutes at a time. The food took an hour (literally) to come to the table. I suggest ordering the food to-go! This is the second time a similar experience has been had at Hooters in the last six months.",2,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"As always they didn't have our reservation said they would seat us asap , as I look around the dinning room there are dirty tables everywhere so like the last 3 times I've gone there we just walk over and sit down and the clean the the table and we order food and nothing is said .I was there 2 hours never saw a manager or bus-boy",2,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
Good food and atmosphere is fun. Lots of beers to choose from.,5,OpenTable Diner,Las Vegas
"I was disappointed that I was not able to call in a reservation. Also we had to wait more then an hour for our food, we didn't order anything out of the ordinary, (wings,a salad, Cheesburger) standard eats. We didn't get our food till an hour and Ten minutes later. Much too long a wait for standard food! Our waitress had to go in the back and do some paperwork,  and she asked another waitress to cover her table for her, well we could see our food sit on the counter for 15 min before a waitress went to pick it up. Our wings had no sauce on them and we asked for them to be buffalo wings and we received them fried only, I had to send them back so they could get some sauce on them. The waitress kept on insisting that they where tossed in Buffalo sauce,  but all of us at the table kept on telling her that they where dry. Also we had to ask for our chesee and ranch sauce, it was supposed to have been served with our order. Our service was very poor and I'm not sure if we will be visiting again. When our first waitress came back from the work she had to do I the back,  she was very apologetic and bought us all of the items we had asked the other waitress to bring. If a waitress who has tables, has to leave to go do work in the back, a reliable waitress should replace her.  So disappointed. 🙁",1,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
The restaurant is stunning and service superb. Menu is limited but has a great variety of choices. Wine list is expansive with interesting selections at all price points.,4,Chikind,Chicago
"Food was absolutely magnificient. We started out with the falafel shareable which was very good and then the sausage flatbread shareable, also very good. The main attraction however was the main courses. We had the Lamb and the Halibut wrapped in fig leaves coupled with the fennel side. Brilliant!!! Throughout the evening the service was great and a server was ever present. The recommended white wine paired very well with all dishes. Great place and a great evening.",5,Martin,Chicago
"Food is mediterranean, tasty, limited for vegetarians as no entree but substantial appetizers/sides. The Langham is a beautiful setting. Romantic, leisurely elegance. Great place for a special evening.",5,pchat,Cleveland
"The service was perfect as usual , the food quality was off - I had the lamb Benedict and usually ask for pineapple instead of potatoes, and served me first the wrong dish, then the wrong item as I asked for it to be prepared and it was greasier than last.  Will still go back often and the service is the best in the city, just need to deliver a consistent product.",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Love this place and try it often. This time the reception experience was strange and slow. Didn't feel the normal welcomeness that is the hallmark of Travelle.  Halibut in fig leaves is my favorite dish and was not as good as last time, the fish was dry and had an odor and just felt poorly done in  comparison to the last time.  Server was fantastic",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Michael was the server and was very attentive and professional. The white Gazpacho was great. Great looking kitchen, definitely adds to the ambience. Right mix of Mediterranean cuisine.  Nothing pretentious just right on.",4,JWWashburne,Chicago
"2nd time there, mentioned on OT that this was anniversary dinner - restaurant missed. Seated in a corner with A/C blowing; had to ask to be moved. Beet salad a swing &amp; a miss, as were both entres. Sommelier Michael very good.",2,OpenTable Diner,Naples
The waiter &amp; barman were very accommodating for a drink I requested that was not on the bar menu.  We had a good laugh about the ingredients but it was recommended by the Chicago Tribune.  It  was very good.  I appreciated their effort.  Jo Ann Putz,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Everything was excellent.  I might go back just for the chicken wings or the soup, but those represent a sidelight to the artfully prepared main courses with great flavors and presentations.  Go now before everyone finds this place.  We took a look thru the glass to the open kitchen and separately chatted with the head chef.  Be sure to look in the interesting bar area and check out some amazing wines in the glass wall.",5,ChazE,Detroit
"Had the hamachi appetizer - didn't like this at all , it was thickly cut and had an odd odor.  The Halibut with bee pollen , olives, and fig was the most amazing dish I have had in a long , long time.  The honey pistachio cake was just ok.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"This is a really solid dining option in a neighborhood that needed an addition of this kind.  The food was very good, the atmosphere is elegant, and the service is first rate.",4,rm116,New York Area
"Travelle has an interesting collection of Mediterranean foods.  Some of the dishes were excellent, a couple were ok.  Chicken and Halibut were great....starters good, cumin carrots were over seasoned and hard to eat, polenta excellent.  Excellent service...nice room, no view.   A bit uneven but overall I would go back.",4,OT123,San Francisco
"Had a great experience here other than my chicken being undercooked. The manager explained how the chicken is slightly pink due to the in house processing and how it is cooked. However after further investigation, they remade my chicken and took it off the bill.",3,Billy23,Chicago
"The restaurant was not crowded for a Saturday brunch.  Lovely decor.  Many very interesting menu options, it was hard to choose.  Our party had sausage and fig pancakes, Nutella pancakes, the Eggs Benedict with the lobster, and lamb hash and everyone really enjoyed their meal.",5,Still67,Chicago
"The service was terrible - we had to ask for the drink/wine list after waiting 10 minutes for the waiter to introduce himself and then needed to ask  to have our plates cleared between courses.  It is so unsightly to have dirty dishes in front of everyone while waiting for the next course especially if they are sitting there for  + 10 minutes. The food presentation and taste were awful - of the six dinners only one plate went back to the kitchen empty.  All of the others were 3/4 to 1/2 full because the food was so unappealing and tasteless.  By the time we finished and we were asked about dessert, we were all weary and worried about what we would get so we passed.   For the price point of this restaurant, they need to do so much better.",1,Disappointed,Chicago
"We ate here as we were staying in the hotel and came away very much disappointed. When we arrived, it was mostly empty (fine) but they took us next to the espresso machine. We asked for a different seat and, though we were denied our request to sit near the window as those seats were reserved, we were reseated. Of course, two of the tables near the window were never filled. The server was very nice, but a bit pushy - we were pressured into spending more on a bottle of wine than we wanted. The food was also disappointing. I always order my steaks well done, but have not in years encountered one quite so over-done. In addition to being chewy, it was dry and lacked flavor. Overall, we wouldn't come back unless it was on someone else's dime.",3,Charles,Milwaukee
We enjoyed our meal here. The food was good but not amazing and it's expensive. The views are nice but you can't see the water from the dining area. Also...the dining area is desolate during brunch time on a Saturday. I guess it's not that popular for breakfast on Saturdays.,3,Melmeg,New York Area
"This is going to be a gem in the City; its hidden in the IBM building across from the Trump building.  Amazing decor and design of the location that provides a clear view of the kitchen.  Very clean presentation and staff is amazingly friendly but also aware of their surroundings.  The menu provides a variety of views of the Mediterranean, not just the expected Persian or Middle Eastern but also southern France and Italy, etc.  Wine list has more opportunities to try something new than sticking to basics of other comparable.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Fantastic service, and a really interesting eclectic menu.",5,Sbaht,New York Area
Enjoyed this restaurant immensely.  Waitress noticed we were uncomfortable sitting next to 2 loud young women and thoughtfully offered to move us to a quieter table.  Enjoyed watching the chefs preparing food in a glass-walled kitchen.  Food was incredible.  Overall very nice.,5,virginialion,Washington DC
"Nice restaurant to be wowed by the ambience, with its lovely dining area and great view. Our appetizers and entrees were very good, with fun touches like jellied olive oil to spread on the bread. Funny, though. My husband and I had our oversized silverware fall on the floor 3 times. So hold on tight, and enjoy.",4,LuciaS,Chicago
"Loved the décor. But, lighting is a little dark in the center of the restaurant. They need to turn the spots up a little over the tables. We sat next to the windows for that reason. Noise level is moderate. Service is excellent. The food is good. But, I had trouble finding something to order. I don't eat four legged animals and overly spicy food. They do have one sea scallop dish. But the waiter warned me it was really spicy. So I ordered the cod and didn't like it because it had too much cumin in it. I would go back after a few months. Since this restaurant is so new, I think they are still working out the kinks in their menu and wine list.",4,kktaylor,Chicago
"Took two of my friends to Travelle for 4th of July celebrations and it was the best choice. Sitting in the bar, river-side, is reason enough to come for a visit. The cocktails are well prepared, great wine list, and best snacks. Highlights were the gazpacho, chickpea fries, and the suckling pig. We split the pig three ways, and one of my friends was still hungry. She ordered the risotto, which filled her to the brim.   I'm pretty certain I have had every dessert on the menu, including the cheese course, and I keep coming back to the pistachio honey cake. Not too sweet, well balanced with exotic flavors, but still has a ""comfort-food"" feel. Wish I had a piece right now.",5,Bunnybites,Chicago
Great visuals..great views for the River...the rooms  were too loud and the food was just adequate.  The service was friendly and efficient.  It's a one time try out...no need to return.,2,LOWKEY,Chicago
"The welcome smile of Evelyn on entering to our waitress and staff makes this place absolutely perfect. Food was dead good, had the moroccan benedict and home made juice and my friend who goes everywhere in NY was in love with the place.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Contemporary setting with  modern open kitchen set on second floor of boutique hotel by the river. Service was very good. Mediterranean dishes from various countries  with many than can be shared. Food is very good and burst with taste and spices of the region.  Bar/ lounge area looked nice with view to the river. There was live music playing. Would certainly stop by for a drink next time Other than a high noise level, my wife &amp; I had a nice overall dinning experience.",4,OpenTable Diner,Miami
The service was excellent. Very personable. All the waiters/waitresses knew their menu inside and out. My friend told them I was graduating residency and they brought us free wine with dessert and a little congratulatory chocolate tag on my dessert - it just shows that they all communicate well too. Overall excellent dinner with plenty of veggie options!,5,TheVegetarian22,Chicago
"Travelle is a tour de force of Mediterranean cuisine.   They featured Portugal and Greece our evening but have a set menu that is fit for sharing amongst guests.  Travelle wait staff are very keen to describe each dish, especially spices, and have an attentive support staff.  Everything was very well prepared, and the wine list is not too long, but eclectic, with a kind Sommelier.",5,Bell801,Seattle
Wonderful restaurant and easy to get into if you need to make a last minute reservation. Service and food were great!,4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Great food that is outside the ordinary.  Great way to treat yourself.,5,Foodie2,New York Area
"We had an early dinner before heading out from the hotel to see a show and we are so glad we chose Travelle.  The Pita Balloon and Muhamara were fantastic as well as the piri-piri chicken and lamb chops.  Service was excellent, they even offered to get us a car for the trip to the show since it was pouring out.",5,ExperiencedDiner,Oklahoma City
"This is one of the best and perhaps underrated restaurants in the River North/Downtown area.  The menu and preparation are so unique and outstanding, and the service cannot be outdone by any Chicago restaurant.  This is my second time here, and I plan to be a regular visitor.  Really great location, with convenient access to public transportation if you need it",5,XXXX,Cincinnati
"The wine list is one of the most encompassing in the city, with many quite expensive bottles and an enormous range geographically and depth within categories.  The chef and servers are especially accessible and knowledgeable.  The current menu features foods of the Mediterranean with a changing focus on certain countries in that region.",5,bellecurve,Chicago
"Though barely quiet enough for a good business discussion (and parts of the restaurant probably aren't) it's otherwise a good spot for a business lunch. Good food, and not the same-old-same-old downtown fare. Very good service.",5,Papaswamp,Chicago
"We had an outstanding experience at Travelle --- The food was wonderful and the service, at all levels, was impeccable.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Went there for a graduation dinner with family. Service was impeccable, and food was fantastic. Somewhat pricey but not overly so, and definitely worth the price compared to some famous restaurants we've been to (including Michelin-starred ones). I sense that the staff are really trying to make the restaurant stand out in the crowded Chicago dining scene, and in my opinion they are succeeding. Saw Chef Tim Graham speaking with a few tables and serving a large group. Would happily go back for special occasions.",5,TChoong,Chicago
Food and service was excellent. The noise level was so high we could not hear each other at a table of 4 - because of that we would never go back.,3,eatoutalot,Chicago
Outstanding restaurant! Welcoming and excellent service! Delicious food!,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"The food was very creative!  Many vegetarian dishes, that made me smile.  I have a dairy sensitivity.  Our waiter knew immediately what dishes had dairy, and the chef made wonderful substitutions!  So often I tell the waiter about my dairy issue, and I will still get food covered in cheese.",5,MicheleWI,Milwaukee
Great experience as usual at Travelle.   Great quality food with unique twists and nice service.,5,ChicagoBizTraveler,Chicago
"Heard this was one of the best Restaurant Week offerings. Was received by a friendly hostess. Food was amazing, even being $44 3 course meal(expected less value) food portions and choices were premium. But what made it a great experience was wait staff, we won’t forget cause our server was Cesar(same as my name). He detailed the menu and made us feel at home. Will definitely go back.",5,CesarBolano,Chicago
"I went to Travelle for the restaurant week and overall I had a good experience. The food was very high quality, although somewhat inconsistent in the sense that the octopus/pork belly appetizer and the steak entree were heads and shoulders above the other items.   The service was a bit strange. Our main waiter was pretty slow and nonresponsive. It seemed like he was working on something else as he disappeared for long stretches. Another waiter--possibly a manager--apologized and gave us a discount on the bill, which was nice. But I wouldn't expect that to happen in a restaurant of this caliber. Perhaps our main waiter was a trainee?",4,SaltandFat,Chicago
"Food was outstanding, though the ""tasting portions"" for restaurant week were a tad small. This was made up for by the quality of the dishes and the service. Cocktails were fantastic as well, will definitely be back.",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"Casual elegance is a good description. Travelle has always been a reliable standby for us in Chicago. We were wary when chef Tim Graham was replaced by Ricardo Jarquin. But the new chef hasn't missed a beat. I love the vibe, very relaxed and elegant atmosphere, ideal for a evening of conversation, service is attentive. Most importantly the food is continues to rival all the trendy hotspots; a bit less of the prior mediterranean influences and more ""American;"" but a lovely and tasteful meal.",5,A2gourmand,Detroit
"Restaurant Week menu was interesting. Portions were small. Service not great. Spilled drinks, miscues on orders and timing.",4,Manwithplan,Chicago
Excellent food and ambience. A minor hiccup in service was corrected promptly and professionally. Will definatly return.,4,OpenTable Diner,New Orleans
"We enjoyed Travelle during restaurant week and to celebrate a birthday.  Typically restaurant week menus are quite limited, but they offered many delicious options!  Smoked burrata was great, as was the Octopus starter.  The strip was also delicious and we added the brussel sprouts and  potatoes as sides.  I guess we were hungry!  I slowed down by dessert, but my dining companion did not.  Travelle knew it was his birthday and when they confirmed over the phone, they told me that traditionally, the birthday person receives a cupcake with a candle on it -- I said sure!  Well, at the end of the meal I thought to myself, NO CUPCAKE!  Our awesome waiter, Thomas, must be psychic because he came over at the end of the meal with some prosecco and champagne glasses.  He said he noticed we'd slow down on the food and wanted us to still have a celebration.!  Great food, excellent service!",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Came in for Chicago Restaurant Week and had an amazing meal! Everything was delicious and the presentation showed creativity and pride in the food being served. Service was excellent and I liked how the staff seemed interested in our experience. Please give this place a visit, you will not be disappointed!",5,KatK,Chicago
"I went for the restaurant week menu and was very happy with the choices. The Lemon Pavlova dessert was divine. The service was excellent throughout the meal, but I was done for quite a while and had to signal the server.to ask for the check.",4,linda,Chicago
Well worth a visit.  Fantastic space and food to die for.  1st time but we will be back and often.  Not for budget watchers.,5,ChowHound,New York Area
Third year in a row for birthday luncheon celebration.  I love the food and the outstanding service.,5,OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 31, 2018"
Went for restaurant week - food was great! Service was top notch. Can't wait to come back!,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
This restaurant was a perfect choice to enjoy restaurant week. The food was extremely good and our server JUAN was superb. My date even got to visit the kitchen and learned about making yummy desserts from the chef. Travelle offered a fantastic dining experience!,5,JoshS,Chicago
The food and the service was excellent.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Everything was perfect, had a whole team of people that made the experience amazing and as always Paul our waiter was excellent but the whole team from entering to the meal were fantastic. They make you feel welcomed and went during restaurant week and had some incredible dishes from octopus to steak and a dessert that was amazing.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Went during restaurant week and the menu looked good. Out of the 4 entrees I chose the fish.  Probably not the way to go unless you are looking for a tasting menu portion as your entrée.  The octopus appetizer was good. Service lacked.  Ordered 2 bottles of white wine and the 2nd bottle came out at room temperature.   Don't see the need to go back.,3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"We went for Restaurant Week lunch and were disappointed. First, we both had to have the lunch - they would not do it for only one. The soup was delicious but it was downhill from there. The branzino was a 2 x 2 sliver that was not a quarter inch thick, and half of that was skin. I would say there were maybe 3 sliver sized bites of fish. The accompanying couscous and cauliflower was equally meager and bland. And the lemon dessert was dull. I have been to the Langham for tea, and it was outstanding. I would not go to Travelle for lunch again though. If Restaurant Week diners are second class diners, then please do not participate in Restaurant Week.",3,great2eatout,Chicago
"Went to lunch during 2018 Restaurant Week. Our group of eight ladies were seated in an eight-person table, privately between the wine/bar bottles. Wonderful setting. The atmosphere is very post; we wanted an elegant ladies lunch and we got it. The wait-staff were very attentive as was expected for this high-priced restaurant. The hostess was almost deferential and everyone made us feel special and like a ""guest"", not just like a customer. We got our coats checked (no charge) and water glasses were filled constantly. The food was tiny, tiny portions (there is no way a grown man used to meat and potatoes would eat here), but presented in such a way it felt like a treat. Definitely not a place to eat if you're a regular person who is famished. I had a cream soup, hanger steak, and chocolate cake. Surprisingly, I was full after lunch! Didn't know I would be! Coffee with dessert; and no problems getting our bill paid by eight various ways (we could have paid with one credit card and split it later, but the waiters were very happy to divvy up the bill between the eight of us). So nothing bad to say against this restaurant. I would DEFINITELY come here again; the afternoon tea looks to be special and this would be a great place for cocktails or showing off Chicago to friends or out-of-town co-workers. Thumbs up!",4,Kristy,Chicago
"The food, wine and the presentation were outstanding.",5,MightyFine,San Diego
Pleasant and professional staff greet you - food was excellent - octopus and pork  belly takoyaki app made me go back the next day with a friend!  Overall excellent place ezceeded expectations!,5,ArthurD,Chicago
"This was emailed to the staff; I have not yet received a response: The service was sub-par (our Prosecco glasses were left empty the entire meal even when we had plenty of wine left in the bottle), but I am writing to tell you about what happened when our check arrived.  Please note that the sub-par service would not typically warrant an email.  When our server brought us the check, I double and triple checked to see if gratuity was added on the bill - it was not.  We had asked our check to split evenly into 8 credit cards  When our receipts came back, we all added gratuity onto the total.  Then I noticed the math did NOT add up.  It turned out that when the server went to run our credit cards, he ADDED the gratuity WITHOUT notifying us.  I'm not sure how often this happens, and how many time you guys are able to get away with it, but it is VERY VERY shady and unethical.  I can't believe the restaurant would condone such a thing, or you would hire such people that would do this.  I dine out very frequently and have worked in the service industry, and I have never come across such a situation.  I am absolutely appalled and disappointed.  Because of what happened with the bill, I will never be returning to your restaurant (the sub-par service was just the cherry on top).",1,Sadsoexpensive,Chicago
Was treated like royalty. The best restaurant service we ever received.  The food was excellent.,5,LidoM,Chicago
"Fantastic service, extremely well prepared food and wonderful environment.  I will be back.",5,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
"Unfortunately this experience was subpar. Wait staff was unassigned so we never knew who to talk to, the portions were ridiculously small, and it took forever to actually get our meal. The ambiance is very pretty but sadly did not live up to its reputation.",3,TheEarlyBird,Chicago
"I enjoy my food ,my wife and I  The tuna tasty and the branzino was very good  Planing to do another visit  As a chef I give them 10/10",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago

"Christmas Dinner at Travelle was the best meal we had while we were in Chicago.  We had a five course prix  fix that was truly outstanding. Started with a fresh hamachi sushi, followed by a pear and greens salad with roasted shallots(yum, yum).  We then had scallops that were the best ever. Scallops were seared perfectly, not salty, and set above a purée of parsnips and pork ragout. Sounds odd, but it was divine.  Brussels sprouts and crispy kale were the perfect topper. Had a braised short rib that was the perfect balance of the rich meat and sauce. He desserts was a delightful snowball with raspberry and chocolate. The best meal I had while visiting Chicago.",5,OpenTable Diner,Seattle
"Beautiful Christmas Eve brunch!  Asked to be moved to pavilion where afternoon tea is usually served for a gorgeous window view of the bridge to the river.  Amazing variety of scrumptious dishes.  Ramen, sushi, amazing king crab legs.  Carving station with delicious ribeye.  Salad bar with so many options!  Loved the fresh homemade tacos and tostadas.  Belgium waffles like I had in Brussels, fabulous fruit toppings (cherries, yum!).  Dessert options were mind blowing, loved the coconut dessert.  Adored the hot chocolate bar with choice of toppings!  Wish I had another stomach to eat with!  Service was impeccable!  Compliments to the chefs, servers, and managers of Travelle for a fabulous Christmas 2017 celebration.  Great personal touches such as Santa and the manager stopping by our table to greet us.",5,FoodieJ,Chicago
Great service!  Not a wide menu but certainly pleasing.  You do not dine here for the value.,4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Outstanding in every aspect. Kudos to the team!,5,OpenTable Diner,New England
"If you're looking for a place with ambiance but not too much noise so that you and friends can catch up, this is the place. We really enjoyed the Cabernet Sauvignon we ordered by the glass, which in restropect should have just ordered the bottle. Can't remember the name of the vineyard but it was perfect for a mellow evening. Thanks to the staff for their attentive service and friendliness. Happy holidays! Mel",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"A great choice Kind of a quiet secret The food is of a very high caliber, possibly Michelin 1 or 2 The place is easy to get into Pricing is average for the setting",4,DavidY,Chicago
"I haven't reviewed a restaurant yet but boy, this restaurant is terrible. I can't believe how they try to sell themselves as this high-dining, quality food place. The dishes were so overpriced and really underwhelming. One entree was scallops for $38 which featured 3 small scallops and about 2 ounces of cauliflower and wild rice. It was ridiculous. The amount of food actually given and the quality was such crap for the price we paid. This restaurant needs to fail.",1,Tastypalet,Chicago
The Lobster roll  bun was stale🤨,3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
First visit at Steadfast as part of Chicago Restaurant Week. The meal was exceptionally delicious. My server was incredibly attentive.  The Mango Cheesecake was divine!  I will be happy to go back and check out the rest of the menu.,5,AMV84,Chicago
"We were there at later dinner on Saturday for our date night. It was a great quite slow due to the fact that the financial district gets quite after 5-6pm and it was very cold night. But we really enjoyed almost private dining set up and the food, service and interior ambience was all top notch. We will definitely go back for a romantic dinner out.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"The food was too pretentious, too many ingredients and flavors.",2,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Went for restaurant week. The meal was very good overall and a good value. Service was a bit rocky at first, but the maitre'd was on the ball and got our service back on track. The pumpkin soup was good, but the standout starter was the veal neck with gnocchi - well worth springing an extra $11 for the 4 course option. The filet mignon was likely smaller than the normal menu filet mignon (hopefully so, because it was not a very large cut of meat), but was delicious and perfectly cooked to a medium rare as requested. The founder was great - nice crisp skin and moist flesh. Unusual to see flounder on a menu - haven't had if in years except in sushi form. The beignets were good, but the beet dessert was outstanding - very inventive, beautiful to look at and delicious as well.",4,GlennC,Chicago
"Great service, complex flavors, and overall delightful experience.  We tried the restaurant week menu for lunch, but I would go back for their lunch and wine pairing on a regular day as well.",5,JaneH,New York Area
"We had an excellent Restaurant Week lunch at Steadfast. My shrimp cocktail, salmon and coconut cheesecake were all delicious. My companion found her kale salad and beignets dessert very tasty, but thought her pork belly sandwich was just a bit too fatty. The accompanying French fries, however, were outstanding.",4,great2eatout,Chicago
"We had dinner before going to the Opera, the food and service were terrific. They veal neck gnocchi and pork chop were fantastic.",4,TAO4,Chicago

Fantastic service.,5,Jason,Indiana
Delicious food! Loved the lobster bisque &amp; bread plates the best. Fish was prepared really well. Everything was so pretty too as it came out! Definitely perfect for a celebration. But we also saw people there for happy hour which seemed like it could work for an after work hangout too.,5,jess,Chicago
Service was superior. Wonderful dining experience. Variety of food options. Very knowledgeable servers. Great overall experience.,5,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
"Wonderful lunch, great food, great host, great wait staff! I will return sooner rather than later hopefully!",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"The food was good but not great. The service was outstanding. We had to get out at a specific time and the servers made sure that happened. We never felt rushed just well taken care of. We had three course. The appetizers were great (pork belly and brioche), the entrees we ok (Salmon &amp; scallops) and the dessert was also ok (pistachio &amp; honey) but a very small portion size.",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
The service was incredibly slow. It took 45 minutes for our meal to arrive. The meal wasn’t great. We won’t go back.,2,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Service was quite slow - especially as we were there for a business lunch.  Took well over 30 minutes for food to arrive.  Portions very small, especially given the high prices.  And, really - $4.50 for an iced tea??  Disappointed overall.",3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"While staying at the Kimpton Gray we ate at Steadfast pre-Theater and, we liked it so much, we went back for breakfast the next day.   The menu was very creative and we ended up sharing a number of small plates and appetizers.  Our waiter Corin was fabulous.  The Amuse-Bouche was a delight for our eyes and taste buds.   My tip - get to the Steadfast before it becomes the cities toughest reservation.",5,OpenTable Diner,Indiana
"Had a business lunch there.  Volume was probably a little too loud to have a business conversation.  I have also been there for lunch with friends.  The noise level is better suited for a casual conversation than a business one.  Food was very good.  I have had the BLT and the Brussels Sprouts salad.  I would recommend both, especially the Brussels Sprouts salad.",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Weird and very limited menu, meh service, disinterested waitress, super loud patrons.  But at least it had good ambiance and very high prices.",3,Traveler,Las Vegas
Excellent food always - try the new chef's tasting menu. Seven generously portioned courses for $115. The dry-aged duck is a great dish to share with a group.,5,Amber,Chicago
"My boyfriend and I dined at Steadfast for NYE 2017. We were looking for a place with great ambiance and a remarkable menu offering, and Steadfast totally delivered. Deciding to go with the chef's selected five-course tasting (a standing option on their menu, with a seven-course route, too), we were absolutely dazzled by the finely crafted dishes presented to us and satisfied by the spectacular quality of the ingredients. Our server was friendly, knowledgeable, and courteous to our requests, and we were checked on by the manager more than once. In addition to the five courses we ordered (roasted beet app., lobster bisque, seared scallop w/ wild mushrooms, filet mignon,  and pistachio strudel), the kitchen and bakery sent us three complementary tastings -- a curry-coconut meringue to open the meal, a small sweet-cream topped with caramel corn after the filet, and a selection of five petit fours after the main dessert. Everything about the presentation and delivery was designed to stimulate the senses and offer a truly unique dining experience. There was a complimentary glass of champagne at midnight, and if you returned to have brunch with them on Jan. 1st, they applied a 20% friends and family discount to your receipt.",5,CatDempse,Chicago
Steadfast offered great presentation and great flavor.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"The service and food at Steadfast were phenomenal. Although we were not daring enough to try the Chef's Choice five-course meal, we did partake in the Chef's Choice bread basket. All of the breads and accouterments were fantastic! The filet that I order was cooked to perfection and accompanied by potatoes cooked three ways, as well as caramelized carrots. For dessert we took the pumpkin cheesecake to-go and I appreciated that our waiter was so concerned that the presentation of the dessert would change in a to-go container. Presented well or not, the cheesecake was amazing! Our post-show New Years Eve dinner was far better than I anticipated. Although the menu was slightly pricier than this suburban girl is used to, the atmosphere, servers, and food were well worth the cost! I would highly recommend this restaurant to people looking for a fancy night out with your significant other!",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Outstanding and attentive service with an incredible meal. The dessert program at Steadfast is something to come for alone. Great wine list and delicious food. Never disappointed here!,5,Jules,Chicago
Great place for lunch in the loop. Lots of options in the menu and have been there a few times and service is good!,5,Vicki,Chicago
The dinner was exquisite! The bread was so fresh and the accompanying butter and pickled set were so different and delicious. Must order the lobster bisque! The dessert came with a palette cleanser and petite fours afterwards. Each was elegantly crafted and quite unexpected. Service was quick and informative. Will definitely come again,5,Dina,Chicago
"The restaurant was absolutely amazing! We loved everything from the friendly host, our awesome waiter and right down to the last crumb of everything that we ate! The halibut was possibly the best prepared fish I have ever eaten! The drinks were delicious and not watered down at all like some places serve. Can’t say enough about how much we loved it!",5,OpenTable Diner,Tampa
"The atmosphere was quite nice and the staff was very attentive.  The reason I only gave it 2 stars is because the menu was too limited for my taste.  The only salad option was a beet salad the night that I went there.  I asked about a salad with greens and was told one was not available.  My girlfriend wanted a light (light in calorie) beer, and we were told they don't have light beer.  That's it.",2,OpenTable Diner,New England
"even though the menu seems to be limited, what they have to offer is spectacular. My wife and i shared the whole roasted duck and it came out perfect. The chef and waiter were conscience of our show  timing and were able to serve when they said they could. I saw a the fillet steak at the table next to me and i do plan to return as the steak looked perfect. a hot red center with little to no char. the bar has an extensive top shelf selection.",5,rical,Chicago
"+Menu selection was great, food was delicious, and waiter was knowledgeable about the entirety of the menu -- food, wine and cocktails.  Food arrived from kitchen orderly and timely. -Overall service could have been a 5 but sections for servers seemed too large or they were understaffed.  When the place became busy, we had trouble getting our server's (or anyone's) attention.  Also, even when it wasn't crowded, bar drinks took exceptionally long (even a glass of wine).",4,djt69,Las Vegas
"A very nice, upscale restaurant for a business lunch or larger party.  Food takes longer than one would expect, as we waited a good 40 minutes for BLT sandwiches.

"A friend and I had a 12pm lunch reservation and were seated right away. I told the waiter that I needed to get back to work for a 1 p.m. meeting. He assured me that that would not be a problem, took our order and...I think the kitchen forgot about it. 40 minutes passed with no food and finally I had to ask to get our lunch to go. There is little sadder than sitting at your desk eating a reheated $22 sandwich and fries after you've had to sit through a meeting practically famished because the restaurant forgot to make your food in a timely matter. I may go back to Steadfast, as the food is delicious and the ambiance is lovely, but I will only go with friends, certainly not business clients. And I won't go if I'm in a hurry. Having your food go missing when you specifically asked to have it in a reasonable time frame is a one-strike-and-you're-out offense for me.  Very disappointing!",3,JennyS,Chicago
Service was personable and not at all intrusive.   Food was excellent as always.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago

One of the best and most unique menus in Chicago,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"The reviews I had read were all over the place, so our expectations weren't overly high, but we were staying in the hotel and it was convenient for pre-theater.  We ordered the tasting menu, along with the wine pairing (same price as the dinner).  The 1st course, a beet salad, was tiny but tasty, and paired well with a sparkling blush wine.   I wasn't impressed with the 2nd course lobster bisque - it was a bit salty and had an excess of sour citrus overtones along with a hint of a slightly burnt taste.  However, the well-paired chardonnay helped soften the taste of the soup.  I was loving the wine pairings, but not thrilled with the food up to this point, but that's when things started looking up.  The sea scallop course (one large scallop) was both a taste and texture explosion and again was perfectly paired with a lovely French pouilly fume.  The fillet ""main course"" (half of a generously sized fillet which had been perfectly cooked to a warm centered bright red medium rare and then cut in half to serve 2) was well seasoned and outstanding - and was paired with an exquisite Bordeaux-style Napa blend.  (We were so thrilled with the wine that we later searched for it online and found it to list at $125/bottle.)  By this time I was so impressed with the meal that I thought dessert would be a let-down, but their James Beard award-winning pastry chef didn't let us down!  The pistachio dessert (paired with a rather dry Reisling that complimented it well) was one of my very favorite desserts of all time - again with tons of flavor and texture dimensions!   Not only was our meal an incredible experience, the service was prompt with each course seamlessly flowing into the next as silverware, plates and glasses were cleared and replaced smoothly throughout.  We had informed our wait-staff that we were attending a play so they knew we were time-conscious, but it didn't feel rushed at all, and we finished with plenty of time to get to our show.    HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",5,RestaurantCritic,Cincinnati

My server asked us to walk up to the bar to see what beers were available because he only work weekends.  I hope that I never have to have him as a server again.  I was pretty embarrassed because I invited my friends down from the Northshore to visit this place and he was their first impression.  My food otherwise was wonderful as ususal.,4,Gena,Chicago
"Great food, non chalant host and server. The biggest issue was the cold. It was below zero this day and the host sat us next the door which had a huge and constant draft of freezing air. We asked to move which was better but still who wants to come in from the cold to eat with cold air blowing over your food. The place wasnt even crowded. Use better judgement and put the paying customer in your shoes.",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Love the huge portions ❤️,5,OpenTable Diner,Cincinnati
For was amazing and portions were HUGE.,4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"We were there early so I can't speak to the service and ambience once the crowd picks up. Bartender Fred knew his job and made a nice bloody. He also took good care of us at the table.  Portions were good size and service came out quickly. The menu features brunch all day with a farm to table slant. Our selections were a mix of sandwiches and brunch food. No one in our group remarked at their meals. Food lacked flavor and sensation. Nothing was bad per se, but nothing stood out. Pork tenderloin was enormous, too big for a sanwich. Corned beef hash was bland. Too many potatoes, not enough meat. All in all, plenty of just okay.",3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
I love breakfast and I'm always looking to find a restaurant with more then just bacon and eggs. Well Has house did not disappoint with the variety on the menu which I really appreciated.

Huge portions!  Popular spot! Not the best tasting food though.,4,BJYes,Chicago
"I fell in love with Hash House because the chicken and waffles that I had were delicious.  A friend and I decided to go back.  This trip I decided to try a stuffed burger with bacon and mashed potatoes.  I have to say it was the most flavorless burger that I ever tasted.  The two burger patties nor the potatoes had any flavor.  My friend ordered the chicken and waffles; they comp her food because the waffles were soggy and immediately fell apart and the coating on the chicken was not what I remembered.    But I can say that if someone decided to go there, go on the weekday as there may have been all but five people sitting to have dinner.  This joint definitely makes its money on the weekends with brunch and lunch.",2,HoneyBunny,Chicago
The portions were huge but the famous chicken and waffles was big but not great.   Even with very few people in the restaurant the service was only so so.  I can say I've been there. Not much more.,3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"This was my first time dining here. When we arrived the restaurant was pretty empty so we were seated before our reservation time. Our server was not very attentive. We ordered beverages and my boyfriends didn't come until after we'd had our food and we had to ask for it. The portions are huge!!! I ordered the sage fried chicken Benedict which was okay, the chicken needed seasoning but the chipotle sauce was good. My boyfriend ordered the pot pie which was interesting, the shell (it came with a shell instead of inside a crust) was not edible and when I asked the waiter about it he stated he didn't recommend my boyfriend try to eat it. My friend ordered a burger medium which they didn't get right either. My other friend ordered the banana pancake which he really enjoyed. Overall the food wasn't that bad, however, the service was.",3,OpenTable Diner,Orange County
"In Chicago for Thanksgiving, and we selected Hash House as our Thanksgiving Meal.  It was a huge hit with our party of 8.

"Sunday night was not the time to go here. Our waitress did not take very good care of us; we were one of four tables and we saw her all of three times. Our food was good except it wasn't very warm and considering it was a hot breakfast item... that was something of a problem. We would've complained except it was hard enough to get someone to come to the table as we were seated by the front windows and seem to be getting ignored. I wondered why it was so empty when we walked in, but if our service was any indication of regular service I can see why. We were also brought our bill without ever being asked if we were interested in eating any food after dinner, which we were, and our waitress took 20 minutes to bring  a new check; again, we were only one of four tables of customers.",2,OpenTable Diner,Las Vegas
I decided that my parents needed to experience a different brunch spot in Chicago. When we walked in my dad immediately loved the decor. Once we received our food everyone agreed that this food was spectacular with huge portions!! Needless to say we will be back.,5,OpenTable Diner,Washington DC
"On this third visit to Travelle, we enjoyed our server's attentiveness as well as friendliness (Peter? about to move to Cape Cod and get married soon). He was very helpful with beverage selections and even introduced us to ""The (Bar)Menu,"" a compendium of highly unusual drinks often based on and evolving from very old fashioned or old time drinks. One had the/a old fashioned and thoroughly enjoyed it. One had the 'brown butter' and marmalade something or other, and  surprisingly like it quite a lot. We loved the black polenta and mushroom dish, unusual but well executed and tasty. And we very much liked the rib eye steak with a well done French wine sauce, although my preference would be to either cut the rib eye myself OR have the chef slice it far more thinly. There were some very delighful vegetables that accompanied the steak, as well. The parker house rolls are very good as is the butter they are served with. Lastly, the Apple Cobbler/ Crisp is one of the best around.",4,ChicGourmet,Chicago
"The place looks nice, the staff is decent, the food looks delicious but the chicken was weird tasting(couldn't get with the sage in it) and though it was fried hot and fresh it sat on top of my waffles which were completely cold but stuffed with bacon and the bacon was cold too, total turn off and ruined my whole 1st time experience there!",2,OpenTable Diner,Chicago

"I've been here several times and decided to take some folks from San Diego (there's a Hash House there - which I didn't realize) Usually the staff is good, but this time, the waitress was old and mean, and the food was greasier than normal.

"I've heard their brunch is amazing, but I went for dinner and it was okay. There were about four other tables and it still took an hour to get our appetizer. The appetizer (fried green tomatoes) was alright, but lots of dough in the batter. Food was okay - huge portions, which was cool. I wouldn't recommend for a dinner spot.",3,ChicagoLady,Chicago
"Wow, very large portions!! Food was great, the staff attentive. We were there for breakfast and left totally stuffed. The menu has something for every palate and the choices seemed endless. I say not overpriced at all in comparison to the quality and quantity. Recommend trying.",5,Mjc019cop,New York Area
"While the food was tasty, the service was terrible. Our server seemed to be in a completely different world. We were actually quite confident that she might have been on something. The amount of time it took to get our drinks initially was pretty outrageous. Later we decided to order more drinks and when we were halfway through ordering she just walked away. We had to repeatedly wave her down whenever we needed something. This would be understandable if the restaurant was packed but that was not the case. I will not go back.",3,annab23,Chicago
"It wasn't a terrible first visit.  The Chicken and waffles were good.  The Chicken Benedict felt as though the ingredients (biscuit, chicken, etc...) were left over from breakfast.  Dry/etc.    Service was pretty good though there weren't many customers.  However at the end of our visit when I had the cash ready to hand off our payment(needing some change to give a very solid tip) our waiter was too busy flirting with a table of females.  We got tired of waiting and reduced  the tip by a few bucks so we wouldn't have to wait for change.  We felt pretty ignored at the end of our visit.  But this wasn't big enough of a deal to not come back.  Our food came quick enough and the waiter was helpful/fast up to that point.",3,jman,Las Vegas
"We went for lunch-chicken and waffles amazingly delicious!  Bread pudding also a must have. Only problem was a bee flying around, but that was beyond their control. Service was great-would definitely go again.",5,Anne,Chicago
"We needed a quick  Saturday night dinner so though we'd try out Hash  House a go-go. At 7:30 pm on a Saturday there were plenty of tables open- which at first was concerning , however we came to appreciate the restaurant.  The service was very slow and the few patrons there were VERY loud.  Over all though the food was good, not great but a solid good and portions as I had read, were HUGE.  The floor was a bit slippery which seems to suggest the mop  needs to be cleaned.  The atmosphere was casual and loud.  Our 15 year olds loved it!  My husband had the salmon which was very good , served over flavorful  smashed potatoes and it was not over-cooked. We had salmon, a burger, a fried pork chop and warm spinach salad- all very good, but again very slow service.  All in all we will probably go pack. It is convenient -(in Gold Coast) and the price is right!",4,OBonTheGo,Chicago
We found Hash House A Go Go on a whim and loved it!! It was rather quiet for a Friday night but the food was incredible and the outdoor seating was very pleasant. We have a two year old and it was a great place for the whole family. I highly recommend it!,5,LAinChicago,Chicago
"Off thean drag of Michigan Ave, but still in walking distance of the heartbeat of Chicago, Hash Hash is serving comfort food with a delicious, eclectic flair. I had the salmon salad which was a huge portion of summer greens and veggies with a nice sized grilled filet on top. My daughter ordered the crab cake and pasta appetizer which she enjoyed. Our server was attentive and we had no wait upon arrival.  I highly recommend this as an alternative to some of the chains and more pedestrian stops in Chicago. These guys have something you should try.",4,Georgiapeach,New England
"When we walked up to the restaurant at 5 on a Monday, we weren't that impressed. Restaurant had no customers and we got nervous.  Waitress was new, so we couldn't get much answered about recommendations. Needless to say, the food was AWESOME, DELICIOUS AND HUGE PORTION SIZES. Chicken sage salad was great, the French fries were well seasoned and awesome. My mother had the fajita off the brunch menu and I was in heaven when I tasted it. Her friend had the chicken and waffle and said it was good but the waffles could have been better. I love the work of art with the food display. I'm definitely going back, but will be earlier or later in the day when more people are there.",4,Moms48th,Chicago

We took a group to the Hash House A Go Go and had a wonderful brunch. The staff was friendly and helpful. We enjoyed a variety of unique food items but the Chicken and Waffles were a hit and what we originally came for. So much food that we left with a to go bag . I was able to find some healthy and lighter options. The bloody Mary's with the bacon were wonderful and would go back just for the drinks. Some in our group had visited the restaurant in Las Vegas and both locations were great and highly recommended.,5,LoriT,Seattle
"This was my first time going to the location in Chicago after loving the one in LV. I must say our server was a pleasure as she was always checking up on us and had a great attitude. The food was amazing as well, even though the prices seem higher, you get a lot of food so it’s totally worth it. The only thing that sucks is the parking, since it’s downtown you gotta use spot hero.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago

The food is way too much &amp; the presentation is just gross. No one can actually eat that much food at one sitting . Way too much sauce on the salmon Benedict with very little salmon.

Had been to Hash House in San Diego and had a great experience (food/service was great).  Wanted to try here in Chicago....unfortunately didn’t have a main entre that we wanted to order. The most disappointing aspect was the service...in particular the server. I can’t temember the last time we experienced service as poor as we had here. Really disappointed as we were really looking forward to the evening.,2,Jona,Chicago

"Happy to have tried it during restaurant week. Nothing was bad but it isn't a good value. For their regular menu, I'd expect it to be outstanding  &amp; there are several wonderful places in the city at this price point that I greatly prefer. Pretty room. Good looking bar. I'd go there for drinks. It confirms the old belief that hotel restaurants are overpriced &amp; not exceptional.",3,MomSays,Chicago
This was our 3rd time here and we really enjoy the food!  Every country bordering on the Mediterranean is fair game for the various dishes prepared.    But I am dismayed at the pricing on the wine list -- very few affordable bottles in the $40-60 range.  And the markup on bottles is obscene -- a $6.99 retail bottle of La Vieille Ferme for $30??,4,Peesquared,Chicago
Had never heard of Travelle prior to coming across it in a list of Resatuarant Week options. Went for lunch and we were more than pleasantly surprised. We both enjoyed the shaved carrot salad (who knew carrot salad could be so tasty?). My companion felt her salmon was the best she had ever had. I had a mushroom pasta that was to die for. Both of our desserts were excellent. We will definitely be returning!,5,Recessionista,Chicago
"We were disappointed with our dinner at Travelle.  We were staying one night at the Langham for my husband's birthday and were experiencing exceptional service, a beautiful room with lovely appointments, great spa, fabulous artwork throughout, and a cool bar.  But the restaurant experience just didn't fit with the rest of the Langham ambience.  Travelle is really  just a very casual, OK restaurant --a nothing special restaurant in a very special hotel.  Doesn't work.",2,nobellpeppers,Chicago
"My friends and I chose Travelle for Restaurant Week because it could accommodate some dietary restrictions and had a great reputation.  The ambiance and service are outstanding, but the food was disappointing.  While the first course started off strong: octopus with pork belly, the second course (short ribs) and dessert (banana pot de creme) were lacking in comparison.  Each of my dinner companions chose a different option and we shared.  Everything looked amazing on the menu and we figured we wouldn't be disappointed.  Again, the first courses: carrot salad, octopus, and sausage were all very well done.  I would have been satisfied if that's all we had for the rest of the evening.  Unfortunately, we had more.  I found the salmon to be too sweet with the citrus glaze and the short rib's profile was not that different than what I tasted in the first course with the pork belly.  There were a lot of beans in both dishes.  The first was successful the second was not as much.  The one standout from the main course was the mushroom ragu.  Very well done.  Dessert was extremely disappointing.  I hope the Executive Pastry Chef was out that night, because the chocolate cake was dry (but the frosting was delicious); it tasted as if it had been made a day before and left out to become stale.  The banana pot de creme was cloying in the banana flavor and the top, which would have been delightful with a traditional creme brulee torched sugar, was instead topped with what appeared to be sugar in the raw granules.  It was unappetizing.  Unfortunately, the cherry cobbler was the last and worst of the bunch.  From the semifreddo on top to the compote on the bottom, I took one bite and couldn't stomach another.  I love dessert more than any other part of the meal, so it is a feat to get me to walk away from a dessert.    I would recommend Travelle if you are going to get drinks and a first course before a show.  Otherwise, I would forgo the trip.",4,eatarved79,Seattle

This is one of my favorite places for breakfast and used to be one of my places for dinner I didn't think there is anything really special about the restaurant week menu and there was shells and bones in one of our dishes the other dish had a full shank in the side of the chicken that almost cut my tooth service was good there was excellent disappoint,3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago

"My wife’s eggs were undercooked and the chicken on my roast chicken hash was dry and flavorless. Taste and presentation was pedestrian at best. Service was above average so that spared the meal but we will not be going back. Oh yeah, spread the tables out or make it communal dining. One or the other so patrons have clear guidelines in regards to conversational volume and content. My wife and I were so close to the table next to us that we couldn’t decide whether to join in their conversation or speak/ shout over them!",3,OpenTable Diner,St. Louis
Restaurant was nice.  Front desk person could have been friendlier but her assist was. Seated us downstairs. Service was great. Music playing was a bit loud for my taste.  Food was good and pancakes were huge. Need to share. Overall a great place to share with a larger group.,4,OpenTable Diner,Detroit
"This was a nice looking restaurant, however upon entering the door, the entire placed smelled like mildew or dirty mop water.  I informed one of the staff members.  The smell was over the entire place which kind of turned my stomach.  Other members of my party mentioned the smell also to me which confirms that it was not just me smelling the unpleasant smell.  The french toast was very good, however my eggs and potatoes were not recommendable to anyone.  The potatoes tasted as if they were previously frozen and then tossed in the oven and taken out way to soon.  No one in my party was totally happy with their food . I felt responsible because it was my husband's birthday and I invited his family.  I can not recommend this restaurant to anyone because it was not a very good eating experience.  The customer service was very good.",2,Shon,Chicago

"So Happy that our friends recommended that we go here.. We were on our way to a Cubs game and staying downtown, there were several places near our hotel we could have met but some friends who live locally suggested Hash House a go go.. It was half way between Wrigley and Downtown, and easier for our friends to meet us and park. We had a great breakfast, as everyone says the portions are huge.. We took the suggestion and split but then ordered a separate french toast because it looked so good :)  My Husband had the Hash and loved it, my friend and I split the ham, eggs, spinach and cheese scramble.. with potatoes and fruit, plenty of food and delicious!!! Tryi it you will like it :)",5,Lane,Orange County

had never eaten here b4 and was great. getting to watch Chef Tim and his crew work was an added bonus. the food was inventive and the service on point. cant wait to return,4,echristmas,Chicago
"Visited Travelle with friends for the first time during Restaurant Week, and were very impressed. The special menu was terrific, and had options to please everyone at the table.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Beautiful dining area. Went for a business lunch, the noise level was very low and wait staff are extremely attentive. The food was great. Will be back to try dinner. One of our party had physical disabilities and the waiter was very helpful.",4,Localfoodie,Chicago
"I was a little surprised at the food options during lunch compared to dinner. I cannot recommend this as a lunch/brunch location. Additionally, the Marine Caesar Salad was well below expectations, shocking really, we are still talking about how bad it was.",3,Smig,New England
"Travelle seems to have floundered after very good initial reviews. The yellowtail appetizer was very good, followed by a disappointing lamb rib appetizer-greasy &amp; overdone. The main course of mushroom risotto sounded delicious &amp; came highly recommended by the server; unfortunately it was so salty to be inedible. It was promptly removed from the bill. Service was excellent!",2,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"From the moment I stepped into the restaurant I was treated like their most valuable guest, and it did not cease.  They easily accommodated me wheat allergy issues, and both the food and the service were top notch. I will recommend and surely will return!",5,Freserboy,Washington DC
"Our family of four surprised my husband for his birthday.  The staff was informed of the occasion and were very generous throughout the evening treating us to a complimentary and excellent burrata and then a trio of desserts.  The service was excellent, gracious without being overly attentive.  Our choices included venison and tenderloin which were perfectly cooked (medium rare) and a surprisingly tender spicy chicken.  A must are the black bean fries and bbq octopus.",4,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"I was expecting a better experience than I had at Travelle Kitchen as Chicago has an amazing food scene. I started with the BBQ octopus and pork belly. Well, the octopus was literally dipped in BBQ sauce which really overwhelmed the dish.  The hanger steak was great, but the fries were heavily coated in a dry rub that conflicted with the dry rub of the steak. The flavor profiles were not complimentary.  It is a bit pricey, but the service was great and the room and hotel are magnificent in design.",3,Randolph,Dallas
Setting and the food for brunch was just perfect. Enjoyed it a lot on a quiet Saturday afternoon.,5,Dejusns,New England
"Excellent atmosphere, great bar, fantastic win list and excellent food. Outstanding service.",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"One can not accurately assess a restaurant based upon a holiday buffet.  I can state that the choices were varied.  The cold area was my favorite with the fresh oysters (2 choices Washington and Long Island), sushi, shrimp, crab, etc.  the carving station offered ham and prime rib.  Both were excellent.  The chaffing dish entrees and vegetables sounded better than they tasted.  In my experience, this is a common experience.  The desserts were individual portions, well-executed and unique.",3,loueater,Louisville
"We went to this restaurant for our Christmas Brunch and reserved through Open Table. Host found the reservation and, even if we came in a little earlier, we were immediately seated. The brunch consisted in fishes, meats, cheeses, charcuteries, carving stations, veggies and obviously desserts. Everything was pretty good, although we were expecting a different variety of desserts (nonetheless, the ones provided were good).  A jazz trio was playing, but the music level was OK. Also the noise level was acceptable.",4,Sheldor86,Chicago
Chef Tim and his staff deliver an excellent meal.  Our only complaint was that the vegetarian risotto served in a hollowed out parmesan wheel  was too salty.  Don't skip the appetizers.,4,Illinitravelor,Chicago
Small hiccup with 11:30am lunch reservation today where I was seated at one table and my guest seated at another.   So I had the advantage of sitting at 2 different tables with 2 different servers. Service was impressive at both tables. (My 1st server even addressed me by name).   Food was very good and prices were reasonable.,4,mptrevino,Chicago
"We dined on Thanksgiving evening, and were very thankful that the tables full of families with toddlers and 4 to 8 year olds were all done with the buffet by 6 PM and left the restaurant as we were being seated.  The hostess did a nice job of seating us as far away as possible from the bedlam.  Once things quieted down, a very pleasant evening, inventive food very reasonably priced.",4,chaz,Chicago
"We are two french students and we were studying at Chicago during Thanksgiving. The brunch/buffet at Travelle Kitchen was stunning! There were a lot of stuff to eat: sushi, seafood, oyster, of course an amazing turkey, a lot of dishes, cheese, crepe, patisserie ... More than quantity, the food was delicious and the service remarkable. The price was a  bit expensive, but it is worth it !",5,MBMB,Chicago
"One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago! The food is more Midwestern than Mediterranean now - try the new venison dish with figs and chestnuts, and the fried Brussels sprouts with guanciale, peppers and bread crumbs. Service is outstanding too and I love the newly expanded wines by the glass list.",5,Amber,Chicago
The restaurant is located of the second floor of the hotel which is beautiful. I love the seating area and how the servers were so attentive. I would definitely go back for the French toast is was good!,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Overall experience could have been better. We ordered a nice bottle of wine Peter Michael Belle Cote. They brought the wrong bottle to the table, it took them a long time to bring the correct one, which arrived after our first appetizers. the appetizers were very good. The main dishes were both a little flat. The pork shank was a little dry and lacked flavor. The risotto was seriously lacking flavor. The service was acceptable albeit a little slow. Don't know if we would go back.",3,SamG,Chicago
we have been at this restaurant several times and the food and service is very consistent.  Love the interior and open kitchen behind the glass.    Bar is also fun !!,5,Grace,Chicago
"Great ambience and service. however, char grilled peppers were completely burnt on the backside of 2/3 of them. could not eat them",2,chicago2015,Minneapolis
The Noregian was excellent! 100%. Took my parents for there 50th wedding anniversary.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"What a great night. Great food, great service and wonderful food. Would definitely go back next time I'm in Chicago.",5,OpenTable Diner,Naples
"I have eaten at Travelle several times and have always have a positive experience, but the  dinner tonight was disappointing.  The food was good, but not exceptional, and the service was poor, at best.",3,lpdining4,Chicago
The food was below average.  My Basilico (Basil Cocktail) didn't even have basil in it! Appetizer was bland and needed salt.  My fish was way over cooked.  Overall horrible!,1,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Really good food, although I recommend reviewing the menu first as we felt the menu selection was quite limited.  Service was very attentive and responsive. We all enjoyed our order and the wine list is very extensive.",5,Diner,Phoenix
Beautiful aesthetic and ambiance. Good food and decent service at breakfast.,3,Qqqq,Milwaukee
The servers and manager were all very conscious of our needs. Recommended a great choice of white wine: huff resiling. The sea-cuterie was also an interesting board. Loved the octopus. The bread can use less charring though. Very modern and clean ambience.,4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"We had several small plates.  Our favorite was the melon, cucumber, and prosciutto salad. It was wonderful. We also had 1 main course, the salmon,  was good.  We took home 3 desserts to share with our sons, they were enjoyed by all.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Our meals were delicious and the service was impeccable! It was an enjoyable celebration.,5,Birthday,San Francisco
"This is a must try restaurant! It's a very interesting menu. The first three categories are snacks and small dishes, the next is entrees. My son and I chose three dishes of the smaller options (the barbequed octopus was our favorite!) and split one from entrees as we were getting pretty full. Everything was delicious! Our ""food consultant"" Ambre made great recommendations and options for choosing dishes. She was attentive throughout but never overbearing.  A truly nice personality. FYI - even the washrooms are as beautiful as the restaurant!",5,ChicagoElle,Chicago
"Surprisingly not busy considering how great the food, wine and service is. We'll definitely be back!",5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
"All of our dishes were mediocre at best.  And, our server was very awkward.  It was very, very overpriced for the experience.  Skip this one and spend your money elsewhere!!",2,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
We opted for this resteurant for my husband birthday dinner I needed Google translator to find out what was on the menu so frustrating  If want to learn another language during dinner I am just going to go to Romania Staff was pretentious and manager was seriously arrogant  He gave me lecture what I should like or not Food was extremely salty and fish I ate was not well prepared,4,Basia,Chicago
"The food was overly seasoned. We had to send back the baby carrots for another dish.  Loud techno-pop music inappropriate.  Cost high for such a mediocre experience that, for a 25th anniversary, I had wanted to be special. None of the cute categories under #2 is applicable.",2,Sherman,Chicago
"If a seafood fan then this is a good spot for you.  However, I would be happy if they would work on the following 2 issues: Travelle has very high wine prices and my fish came to my table at room temperature.  I know my server would have been happy to return my dinner to the kitchen but being fish I didn't want it ""reheated"" only to dry out.  Otherwise, the meal was very good and I would be happy to dine here again!",4,WindyCityDiner,Chicago
"Tried Travelle for the first time and had a very mixed experience. Service was uneven, the dining room is deafeningly loud due to the adjacent bar, although most of the food was better than good. Manhattans were a shocking $29/each, which I discovered only upon receipt of the bill. When I questioned the charge, the waiter shrugged and said ""hotel prices."" There are far better places to drop $300 for a dinner for two than Travelle.",2,Christopher,Chicago
"This was our second visit to Travelle and the first, while rushed due to theater, was superior. This time, the firsts came quickly and the entrees seemed to take forever. The descriptions of the fish items were not clear and our friends got thick fish when expecting thin and vice versa. I had lamb chops, single-cut, which were fatty, dry and tastelss. The pureed carrots under the lamb was overpowered with cumin (I think), a spice that need not be heavy.  Same with the other unidentifiable vegetable on the plate. Dessert was a highlight. It will be a while before we give them another chance.",3,lwiz,Chicago
Just a wide variety of items for every type of guest. Perfect.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Very delicious Lamb Burger and salad. As always Nicole and all were awesome,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"We recently dined at Travelle.  It was a fantastic place, with amazing tastes and one of the best staffs I have ever seen.  I highly recommend it for a trendy dinner!",4,Prasad,Chicago
Just ate for the 1st time at Travelle. Outstanding restaurant. The food was unique and the service was wonderful. Fantastic menu. Highly recommend,5,ema65,Chicago
"Once again, outstanding. This time we came with a couple one of whom is gluten intolerant. Great menu options and adapted a dessert for her.",5,GlobalGourmet,Chicago
"There are a lot of restaurants that I try once and never go back to, either because there wasn't enough there to pull me back (in a city where I already have a lot of favorites), or because of something actively annoying.  Travelle won me over, for a few reasons.  The menu is really unusual.  Several of our dishes were excellent; my favorite was the squid ink pasta with calamari and lobster broth (complex, balanced, lively).  The wine list is extraordinary, at all price points.  And the service, while not glitch-free, was exemplary in how it handled those glitches.  Overall, a really good meal, and I'm left eager to return!",4,PPMM,Chicago
"The glass-walled kitchen (remarkably soundproof) brings the dining room to the chef's table.  The food is attractive and the flavorings inventive.  The wine list is huge, and includes offerings from many of the countries that touch the Mediterranean- unfortunately, very few selections for less than $100, which discourages most diners from trying something new.",5,gibson,Chicago
The food is delicious.  The decor is beautiful.  And the wait staff and service are wonderful. We loved our experience at Travelle!,5,dineout,Chicago
"but it took a bit to find it.  On the 2nd floor of a hotel that doesn't look like a hotel.  But well worth the effort.  Bar was busy, restaurant not.  Beautifully designed space with clean lines, lots of windows out, and an open kitchen.  Service was exceptional.   We ordered starters to share.  Food was rustic in concept, and presentation, but sophisticated in flavor.  We plan to return.",5,dmarkia,Chicago
"Had a nice business lunch and as always Nicole, Alpa, and Lindsey made my guest feel welcome and respected. The server was again perfect and just had a great time - liked the portion size for lunch.  Good business lunch.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Amazing dinner!  Great to find a menu that makes it difficult to choose with so many incredible options. The only thing they need to change is to pull the window sheers closed since all you see are offensive glaring street lights through dirty windows that overlooks a parking garage.  The decor is elegant and food that made this foodie go ""wow!""  Just ask for a table away from the window unless they close the beautiful sheers.  The wine list is over the top!",5,james,St. Louis
"Wonderful service, excellent food and elegant decor.",5,fpToronto,Toronto
"What I love about Travelle is that you have wonderful food but the servers and whole staff are both elegant and down to earth at the same time. We tried the beet salad, which at every other place I have had I have not enjoyed, this was with goat cheese and had cumin - it was amazing. I could of eaten 2 of those for dinner alone.  Tried the new Cod and squash and again perfectly done with this light outside batter that was delicious.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Alpa was awesome as usual and our waiter was literally the best waiter I have ever had. He remembered my favorite appetizer and preferences and was just insanely great.   We tried the Piri Piri chicken and hamachi and it was just perfect. Moist and seasoned well , wonderful.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"This place is beautiful!  The room is clean and crisp in a modern style with ""Mad Men"" style cues.  The glass enclosed kitchen is a spectacle and it gives you a great view of all the very busy staff that is making the wonderful food you will be eating.  The food is excellent, with unique tastes and generous portions.  I would think any foodie would be happy.  On the negative side, the service is overly fast.  Your appetizers come 5 minutes after ordering and the wine list is EXPENSIVE.  Overall, i would recommend as I enjoyed my experience.",4,defoodie,Philadelphia
"I book a table at Travelle because I could get 1,000 points by doing so.  I mentioned we were celebrating my husband's birthday.  We were greeted by several staff members, each wishing him a happy birthday.  Our server was knew his stuff without being pompous.  We enjoyed five starters and one entree, followed by dessert.  Each plate was amazing with the exception of the crostada dessert.  They brought out a cupcake with a candle that was excellent.  Overall, we were quite impressed and felt we had a great dining experience.  We would definitely go back.",5,Froglover,Chicago
Service was a little slow for coffee refills and we were the only people in the entire restaurant.  The food was fabulous! We had  10:30 am reservation.,4,OpenTable Diner,Las Vegas
"Well, it seemed a bit overpriced for what you got. I dined with a friend and our bill for a handful of small appetizers was over $200. There are comparable places - with food, ambiance and wait staff that are equally as great- but that have far better rates. I'm not sure that I'd return again for that reason.",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Black bean fries, carrot salad, chocolate cake dessert were highlights. Fish crudo not my favorite. Very attentive pleasant service. Pretty space.",4,nomad,Chicago
"My second time here.  My friend and I split the carrot salad and the halibut and both were delicious.  We finished with the apple crisp and another desert and both were really, really good.  Definitely would good back.  A beautiful place, a great bar, very attentive service and wonderful food.",4,Seasaidh,Chicago
"We had lunch at Travelle before attending the play, Assassination Theater, at the Museum of Broadcast Communications on October 10th.  Our restaurant seats over-looked the museum.  Great view of a bustling Chicago area!  We each ordered the spicy chicken wraps -- good, but a bit too spicy for our taste.  The service was excellent!  Our waiter and bus-person were both kind, gracious, helpful, and altogether pleasant.  A nice start to an enjoyable day.",4,ShirleyC,Chicago
"I joined colleagues for lunch this week and everyone's food was beautiful and delicious.  The Wabash Express is a fun choice to get soup or salad, choice of and entree and choice of dessert.  Our table was fighting over the chocolate cake.  Everyone left happy and plans to return.  Bring your friends or colleagues here for lunch!",5,ColDan13,Chicago
"Very nice dining experience.  Nice open format with eclectic food selections.  Wide range of prices so you can go ""light"" or spend as much as you desire.  My son's bone marrow special was very good.",4,JBig,Louisville
"The service was very nice.  The room was pleasant, but the food was just not very good.  I had the tuna tartare to start and the duck breast as a main course.  Both were mediocre.  I didn't even eat most of the duck.  Some of the appetizers were good, like the flatbread starter (sort of a mini pizza), but overall it was very disappointing.  We ate out in Chicago 6 nights in a row last week and it was the worst meal by far.  We won't return.",3,DBfromNY,New York Area
"Went for lunch.  Pleasant room n the 2nd floor of the Langham Hotel.  We had sandwiches for lunch that were very good. I had the club sandwich while my friend had the walleye pike sandwich.   Both were very tasty,",4,Howardr48,Chicago
"The Travelle is in the Langham Hotel in the heart of the city.   The Langham is an amazing hotel.  The Travelle... not so amazing.  I went for lunch on a Friday afternoon, so it was quiet.  I ordered off the Wabash Express menu, which is a 3-course meal for $29.  I liked the presentation and portions.  Unfortunately, the food lacked flavor.  I had the chicken which was like eating a salt brick.  The white gazpacho was bland.  The chocolate cake was ordinary, except for the chocolate covered corn flakes which was good as were the corn nuts.  The service was good.  I don't plan on going back to the Travelle, because Chicago has so many good restaurants where I can dine and have an all around good experience.  I will, however, still enjoy the Langham, the afternoon tea service (which is phenomenal) and Elle on the River.",3,yummyummy,Chicago
"decided to try this place for lunch - restaurant located  on second floor of the builiding, easy elevator access.   The service was quick and not intrusive.   Good views of the river and Marina towers.   Recommended for meeting and having a quiet lunch.",3,Rocky74,Chicago
A great selection of typical brunch dishes with a twist   Great food and even better service!,5,reVIEWER,New England
"THE FOOD WAS TASTY, THE  SERVICE WAS GOOD THE AMBIANCE WAS INVITING. MY ONLY COMPLAINT AND REGRET IS AFTER STATING ON THE INVITE THAT WE WERE CELEBRATING A SPECIAL BIRTHDAY I HAD TO REMIND OUR WAITER AT THE END OF OUR DINNER THAT IT WAS MY SISTERS BIRTHDAY. KIND OF RUINED IT FOR US.",4,good2eat,Chicago
"Our brunch at Travelle was very good from food , drinks to service. We got in a little later in the morning and avoided the breakfast rush so we were given the brunch menu. I chose the Florentine Benedict and it was delicious. My brunchmate chose a different benedict and he also loved his as well. Equally in greatness was the drink I had, the Trinidad James. The table next to us was oohing and ahhing over our food and drink order before they placed their own. The dining atmosphere is very nice, all the of table are spaced out well. The service was very polite yet personable. This is a great spot for a fun champagne brunch for the ladies.",5,JW1975,Chicago
The wait staff was very attentive and kind.,4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"The positives - beautiful hotel, beautiful restaurant. Very well made cocktails. Service was good, both friendly and professional.  Appetizers were enjoyed. We shared the hamachi tartare, ceviche, black bean fries and roasted bone marrow. All were good, although the bread served with the bone marrow was disappointing. Tasted like a day old hogie roll.   The negatives - I'm tired of a wine list where the least expensive bottle is well over $100. We drank a $190 bottle of pinot noir that was only fair. I've enjoyed $70 pinots that are much better. For the entrees we shared a whole roasted scorpion fish, another fish feature &amp; the steak. The whole fish was well prepared but completely bland. Needed fresh herbs, acid, something. The other fish special was good and had a nice spice. The steak, very disappointing. Again, properly prepared, I just did't care for the flavor of the dish.   Both desserts were fine, but not spectacular. I'd go back to their bar for a drink, but likely won't return to eat.",2,jllutz3,Chicago
"I was not very impressed with the food and at this price point it should be much better.  My server was excellent, my hostess was not very attentitve.",3,dinner42,Chicago
"We started by having drinks in a most beautiful setting with the most incredible views. The lovely server brought our drinks, unfortunately at $18.00 for a cocktail, I hoped to get a full pour but instead I received a short pour in a small martini glass.  when I commented on that I was told that's just how they pour them.  My guests found it odd and also thought it to be a short pour as well. Probably not such a good policy for a place that was less than a quarter full. I believe the restaurant is English owned and I know they pour small cocktails in London but different here in America. It probably would not have hurt them to top off my small glass. After drinks we sat down at a most beautiful table and the restaurant is spectacular.  Our server was wonderful and helpful and knew the menu very well.  He really changed our attitude and we ultimately had a great dinner. The presentations were amazing and our dessert was delicious.  After dinner the bar scene picked up and the views and setting was outstanding!  I say ""a must go to"" place but don't expect too much from the bar other than an exquisite interiors and amazing views.",4,SRose,Chicago
"We have eaten at Travelle several times since it opened and loved the mediterranean cuisine which was full of exciting flavours and options.  Sadly, although the food is still excellent, the menu has changed and is no longer mediterranean but contemporary american.  There are plenty of contemporary american restaurants in Chicago and we went to Travelle (along with many of our friends) to experience something deliciously different.",5,suju,Detroit
"In short: a disappointing meal.  Nothing was particularly wrong, it just wasn't anything that was particularly great.  Neither I nor my guest ""licked the plate"" on any dish we had.  They were pretty good, but a long way from something one relishes.  Too bad.  (Curiously, room service, possibly from the same kitchen, was excellent!)",3,OpenTable Diner,Los Angeles
"Service is great, food is prepared deliciously well. Beautiful decor creating a nice ambience &amp; beautiful view of the Chicago River. I will be back.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Alpana set the evening by being so kind and warm and welcoming us to dinner. She was AMAZING in how comfortable she made everyone and service was always awesome.  Not sure what the stuffy comments or reviews are about but for us everything was wonderful. The hamachi was yummy, as well as the halibut and nutella baklava",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Travelle is the perfect ""casually elegant"" lunch spot. THe Hotel is beautiful and lush  while The dining room is a departure with  clean lined design.  The casual atmosphere of the dining room makes business conversation come easy. The wait staff was more than accomodating and the food was very good!! The cucumber soup was fabulous!  Also, Travelle prepared a email invite to send to my business guests, which made me look so prepared and professional.    I will definitely take clients there again.",4,designerfoodie,Chicago
What a laid back gem. Had a lovely birthday there.,5,nancyinchicago,Palm Springs
"either the kitchen or waiter messed up 2 or ur 3 orders.  I'm lactose intolerant and the water acknowledged that.  I ordered a salad and asked for a non-dairy dresssing on the side and they brought me the creamy dairy dressing.  One dinner ordered a sandwich and it came with salad or fries, she asked for salad and received fries.  The waiter never acknowledged either mistake.  not acceptable. hostess was snooty.  The waiter was nice but tried too hard to project the place as hip and trendy.",2,Catsup,Chicago
"We had drinks in the lounge to celebrate our 29th wedding anniversary.  I ordered the Proseco which was presented in a beautiful wine glass and my husband had a delicious Bloody Mary.  Our waiter, Kevin, was very excellent and attentive.  Great experience, having drinks and looking out at the Chicago river. We had the buffet for breakfast at Travelle, as well.  The wait staff is very attentive and informative.  The food was very good and the setting was wonderful.",5,DianeHen,Chicago
"My wife and I went to Travelle for our 15th Anniversary. It was probably the best meal we have ever had together. And we travel (Paris, Berlin, Prague, London, Madrid, New York, San Francisco....) quite a lot, and we like to eat out. The food was uniformly superb, and I don't think I have ever had better service. Every last detail was just right. Food came at a nice pace, so we never felt rushed or that we were waiting. Service was attentive without being intrusive. Definitely on our A list!",5,ExtraCrispy,Cincinnati
"We celebrated my husband's birthday and it lived up to my hope for a special experience.  The menu is interesting and the food was great.  Only suggestions are for the sommelier to maybe ask a few questions before jumping to a recommendation, and also for the staff to explain what's on your plate when it arrives.  The preparations and ingredients are very interesting, but not always easy to recognize on the plate.  We really enjoyed our experience, and chatting with the chef.  Would definitely recommend.",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Some of the dishes are interesting. The goat beet salad has the cheese seasoned in cumin. It's different. Not for everyone. Could be good for foodies. We only tried the vegetarian dishes. Their gazpacho was tasty. Did not try the falafel which is a signature dish. The ambiance was nice. Clean and quiet. The bar area has nice views. Service was very slow. It took 20 min after we were seated to get our food ordered. And at the end out server forgot about us and I had to go find him for the check. Once you ordered food came out quickly. Overall we had a good experience except for slow service. I would recommend to my friends who want to try something different in terms of flavors and dishes.,3,Foodie,Chicago
"Tried the Hamachi and another fish appetizer and this time it was fantastic. As always service was perfect.  My friend had the suckling pig , and I tried it and it was incredible.   Fig halibut was not as good as past visits, very dry and for some reason the portion was halved. This is my favorite dish here and still not up to the first time I tried it here.",4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"The chef has an interesting approach to the menu with one side offering seasonal, region-inspired dishes.  The other side with the still creative and regional dishes you may have heard or read about and anticipated ordering.  All were beautifully presented, prepared and explained especially well by Peter who shared his passion for and knowledge of the food.   The bar is also a must-see spot for the views along the river and skyline, comfortable seating and equally inspired and well-prepared drinks. We will definitely return.",5,JudyL,Chicago
"A restaurant in a fabulous Mies Van Der Rohe building - Bar has vintage leather seating Don Draper style martinis. Dining room feels kind of old-school - with soft aged leather banquettes and funky midcentury chairs.  Views overlook the river and are fantastic at night. The wine room is very cool - glass walls with each bottle placed so the labels are facing out and servers are extremely knowledgeable!!!  The open kitchen is definitely the focal point of the dining room - floor to ceiling glass, spotless kitchen floor, fun to watch the chefs and prep cooks at their stations.  Food was inventive and creatively presented.  The chef did table-side fish presentation for the diners next to us - very impressive. Enjoyed our evening very much!",5,modernartgirl,Chicago
"Everything about Travelle was exceptional: food, service, views, options, decor! The only complaint I had was that while in the bar teenagers continued to wander in. One Direction was apparently staying at the hotel but it seemed inappropriate for them to be in the bar which detracted from the ambiance. In fairness, the hotel did attempt security and even questioned my friend and I before allowing us to enter. We stayed at another hotel nearby but would choose the Langham in the future. It's a winner!",5,samlive,Chicago
"Hotel dining can be disappointing but Travelle was wonderful.  An efficient, knowledgable server, delicious food which was served with style and tasted even better than it looked made for a memorable experience. We will come back for sure.",4,OpenTable Diner,San Francisco
"Other than the excellent food,disappointing. Our waiter was always one step behind ie recommended wine after it was ordered and asked if we wanted a dessert menu after we finished dessert. Also pretended to know wine, but not that knowledgeable (When we ordered a second bottle of the excellent Pinor Noir we had, he said that that was their last bottle (understood) and recommended something ""similar""which was not even close.) Also we needed to ask for fresh plates each time for the next courses . To make matters worse the place was almost empty so no excuses    We often  often dine at restaurants at this price range so we expect the experience to be commensurate with the price and it was not.",3,goodchow,Chicago
"Open contemporary design and scenic view particularly from lounge are positives. Seafood is emphasized halibut was good, squid pasta dish was a big miss, flaming chicken app adds wow factor to basic food,  Seacuterie hodgepodge app interesting but not special. Suckling pig was good, no beef entrees offered. Not dissappointed but would be more inclined to return for a cocktail than for dinner",4,Steakasaurus,Naples
"Always great,good food enormous  portons and great location. Good place to relax, enjoy and people  watch.",5,FEERLESSWARRIOR,Chicago
"The food was expertly done here.  The drinks are also very inventive and strong!  My husband and I had a great, romantic night out.  Be sure to get dessert!",5,AngieH,Chicago
"Lovely, laid back, with contemporary furnishings  in the dining room. Nicely spaced tables allow conversation. Knowledgeable wait staff are most pleasant. Although I was not facing the kitchen, it is totally visible through its glass wall, which is a nice to. Sophisticated wine list with some nice glass pours.",4,Wineseller,Chicago
"We loved the food.  It was inventive with great flavors and refreshingly different!  The service was fine although our server (female) was so focused on being efficient at getting to all of her tables that she wasn't that personable.  The dining room was not very aesthetically pleasing.  I felt as though the room was likely also used for the hotel breakfast buffet as one could see a giant coffee station as well as what appeared to be warming aghast above a table where I suspect the buffet is placed.  There was a long row of booth seating which resembled what you'd see in a two or three star hotel dining room.  The clear view of the glass encased kitchen was great until we saw our dessert come out of the microwave (I really didn't need to see that even if it is reality)....  Net, a nice experience, I'd tell others to give it a try, though I doubt we'll return.",3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"You know a restaurant has imaginative food when the customers ask the server how things are prepared, and even what specific things are (which are, incidentally, delicious) .  On top of that, one of our company was unhappy (there was a misunderstanding about what was ordered) but they refused an offer to correct the error, yet didn't eat the main course. The server took the dish off the bill and served up two desserts, despite our thinking (erroneously, it turned out) that we had no room for dessert.  In all, a first class experience.",5,GeoffN,Detroit
The food was great and the service in the lounge was great but the table service was non-existent.  It was unfortunate that such a great meal was serviced so poorly.,5,OpenTable Diner,New York Area
There's a lot of servers and all of them are pleasant and attentive but the service was slow. It wasn't a busy day but we waited a long time for our food. It was pricey as well.,3,Gaby,Chicago
Took a friend for fancy lunch. Was fun to be seated near the glassed in kitchen. Views are very urban.  Crowd was mix of hotel guests and business.  Staff was pleasant and friendly.  Menu somewhat limited but we happened to be there for chef's week and tried the tasting menu which was excellent.  A good addition to the higher end lunch choices especially for north loop/river north.  After lunch we took a tour of the spa which is the most posh in the city.,4,PrincessPinotNoir,Chicago
We had a great experience here. Terrific service and nice ambiance. The desserts were fantastic.,4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Although the ambiance is so so, the food is very good with lots of interesting choices.  The service was great!  Our waiter Mike was very personable, attentive and knowledgeable.  We will come back again.",4,GourmetGene,Chicago
"I admit I'm biased against hotel restaurants, but this was a pleasant surprise. The menu was pretentious but very good, which is even more rare in a hotel restaurant. The wine selection was good, albeit pricey. The ambience is cool, almost cold, but tasteful. Prices were high, as would be expected. Our server was outstanding -- friendly, tactful, great suggestions, unobtrusive but ever present when needed, almost magical à la Bagger Vance. Overall an excellent experience.",4,Alfonso,Chicago
"Loved the menu with uncommon pairings of meats, veggies and sauces. Plate size is so big it should be shared. A bit confused because the online menu is VERY different than the real menu. My meat and potatoes guy was ready for a steak yet there was none to be found once we got there.",5,Jackie,Chicago
"Dined on a Saturday evening (5:00 PM) and was handed the brunch menu... I had to ask for a dinner menu and the server stated that they weren't finished, yet.  They hustled one up and it had about four entrees listed.  I have been to Hash House locations in Reno and three different locations in Las Vegas and was looking forward to some quirky, insane food choices.  Very disappointed that I only had about four selections (two of which - the stuffed meatloaf and the pork tenderloin - I'd had at other locations).  The food was very tasty and portions plentiful (though not as outrageous as in Nevada) so there were no complaints there... just that the variety was disappointing.",3,OpenTable Diner,Las Vegas
The portions were ridiculously large,3,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
The service was great' Dave did great job and the food was excellent will definitely  Go  back again.,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"Food is great!! The portions are huge so definitely split your meal! However, the bloody Mary's did not live up to the hype, and the service was so so. Don't bother making a reservation--they sat our party of 8 thirty minutes late and acted like they've never handled a reservation before.",4,Kelsey,Chicago
"Our group of 8 had a blast. We were a little disappointed when we arrived and found out that they couldn't accommodate a party of our size for their outdoor area. However, we waited for about 5 extra minutes and they made it happen! The drinks were awesome, food was delish and our waiter was extremely attentive. We dine here at least once a month, so we didn't expect anything less.",5,Bsnow,Chicago
"This spot is a must-go with not only amazing food but equally if not more impressive presentation. Each dish is big enough to be shared no matter how much you eat.   Best to try and get a reservation, but note they don't take them for brunch on Saturday and Sunday. Be prepared for a bit of a wait. But it is worth it!  Good luck and enjoy!",5,Jane,Minneapolis
"Table service and food was awesome !!!. Big Big Big draw back was host. When arriving maybe waited 7-10 minutes felt like an hour before being acknowledged. No smile or welcome, I understand coming after an extremely busy day but a simple ""hello I'm getting your table ready or be with you shortly couldn't hurt"". I'm a little impatient guest and sometimes will be reasons I would never come back. Table service and food ""kids loved it"" made up..",4,Ziggy,Chicago
Father's Day,4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
"2nd x here. 1st time was much less busy &amp; service was great.  lackluster service this time.Sunday at 12:30. Healthy egg scramble was room temp &amp; lacked flavor. Server let fruit fall from a plate &amp; neither said nor did anything. Other guy picked it up &amp; took it away, but did not replenish fruit.  Main waiter was generally unattentive. Had to ask for 4th silverware, and butter. No jam on table for the great toast. Other dishes for 3 people were very good.  Won't hurry back.",3,JoeEagle,Chicago
We went there on Father's Day and had a reservation. We were informed when we arrived that they were running 25 minutes behind schedule for reservations!!! Inexcusable.  Food however is excellent!,3,MSBBQ,Chicago
"Usually make Hash House a must stop when in Vegas.  This was our first time at the Chicago location and it did not disappoint.  Portions are so large, you shouldn't finish a meal.  But they are so tasty it is hard to stop eating.",5,PapaDaddio,Las Vegas
"I saw. I came. I conquered.    I had heard great things about Hash House. The food was great. The service was average. The bloody Mary was AMAZING.   All in  all... I was really happy with the food, and the drinks.",3,Kellal44,Chicago
"Thankfully, the rain kept any large crowds away.  No matter, the flow of customers was steady.   But who cares?  I was here for the food, and the signature dish did not disappoint.    The presentation of the rosemary chicken and waffles is outstanding.  Believe the comments, it is enough food for two people to share.  One chicken breast and two waffles for each person would satisfy most appetites.    The chicken was fried in a light oil with the right crunch.  Leftovers still taste great.  Sprinkle on a bit of Tabasco with the maple syrup for the right balance of sweet and spicy.    The BBQ chicken sandwich got completely devoured by my daughter.  This means it was REAL GOOD!  Since I pay the bill, I can tell you that the food is moderate-to-low priced.",4,Kjuan,Chicago
The food was outstanding and the service was excellent. We will return!,5,Leti,New Orleans
"The Chicken and Waffles and Benedict dishes were excellent! Large portions! Service was good, too!",5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Portions are extremely large. Consider ordering a plate and sharing!,4,Jazzy,Chicago
Our first experience at Hash house a go go was in LasVegas.....What a burger!   We were pleased to learn that there was one in our hometown of Chicaga.   Food was just as good and hot!  Service was ok considering it was not crowded like LasVegas.,4,Yumyum,Chicago
"Several in my party really loved this place. Food was delicious, and they accommodated a 2 year old, no problem.",4,Schmeiller,Chicago
I visited here for my birthday and was extremely happy with the service and food. I will definitely visit here again soon!,5,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
Breakfast---chicken and waffles...corn beef hash...salmon scramble--2 avocado scramble. 2 Bloody marys..4 coffee--one tea--I1 oj--$120 Food just ok---they give u lots but it is not great. Breakfast potatoes are terrible. Waiter just didn't care. Close for breakfast if you cant do it right. Got a pic of my chix and waffle--that is what I went there for.,2,OpenTable Diner,Sacramento
"We went to Hash House for Mothers day dinner. It was not very busy, but waiter wasn't very informed on menu and food took forever to come. I think they were short staffed too. Most food was pretty good , except daughters order grilled chicken breasts and they were very seared to a burnt! they did offer to redo, but my girls were so starving they couldn't wait any longer. I think they should of offered us something complimentary...",2,stacytracy,Chicago
"I ate here for brunch on Mother's Day and it was a great experience. We arrived early to our reservation and we're still seated right away. The service was awesome even though the restaurant was packed. The food was incredible and I would recommend this place to anyone, especially someone with a big appetite!",5,JayPom,Chicago
"I found this place because of the original in San Diego.  The food is the same and just as great as the original.  Service this visit was great and the food delicious.  Only gripe, do something about the parking.  There's a lot across the street but, $22 for an hour breakfast is a bit much.  Validate or valet guys!!!",5,CJOJR,Los Angeles
"Went with 3 ladies for a birthday dinner...ironically, we all ordered chicken and waffles and we all had the same response - off the chain! ❤️❤️❤️ The presentation, aroma, and beauty of the dish! The first bite of the chicken and I was hooked! The leeks were great, the waffles with the bacon cooked in them...wow! Will definitely return!",5,DeeLois,Chicago
The food here was to die for! I have to say the highlight was discovering the bacon inside the Waffles! Spectacular!,5,MzNeauxla,Chicago
"We are regulars at Hash House for dinner, and consistently have had an excellent experience.  Our favorite dish, Salmon, is superb.   Special shout-out to our server, Kelley, who is terrific.",5,Howard,Chicago
"Four of us went to dinner, and all ordered the pork tenderloins.  they are amazing!  Huge, flavorful and the salad or fries that comes with it are both excellent.  Fun atmosphere, good for all ages.  Our waiter was knowledgeable, attentive and had a good personality.  We will be back!!",5,Fairlady,Chicago
This was our second visit. It was my parents anniversary. There was one waitress to an entire section. My mom received the wrong order initially and my dad's corn beef was over cooked &amp; stringy. Not the anniversary experience that I hoped for.,3,TeeW,Chicago
I had a great time...the staff was on point and the food was great.,5,GenoXL1,Chicago
"Great food, great drinks, great music abd great prices...",5,ReeseyandLaw,Chicago
"Took my friend here for a birthday meal. Everyone in the group loved their meal, the portions and the prices.  I personally had thr stuffed burger with roasted red peppers and mozzarella cheese. Didn't have to add a single condiment. The ladies had the chicken pot pie, tractor driver special, stuffed burger with cheese and mushrooms and biscuits with gravy. Adrian (sp?) was very charming and attentive. I'll be going back tomorrow for the chicken and waffles.",5,jillianb69,Chicago
Enjoy the service ad usual,5,Chitown,Chicago
We went there for dinner and it was rather quite (Monday night).  The food was good and we really liked the choices on the breakfast menu.  Will definitely be back for brunch.  Still a nice spot for having dinner on Monday night.  The food was priced very reasonably.,4,OpenTable Diner,Chicago
I normally enjoy going to Hash house a go go but this time around the food I ordered was terrible. I ordered a salmon burger and it had little to no flavor and was so dry. I had to ask the server for extra mustard sauce so the food could be digestible. I was quite disappointed especially considering my other visits had been good. The service was great and the staff were very friendly but the quality of the food was bad. I,2,SJohnson,Chicago
This place was one of the best!!!! The food was incredible! Cannot wait to return for more.,5,DavyandSonia,Cleveland
"My family's first choice was the Batter and Berries restaurant. But I was not feeling the 2.5 hour wait so we decided on Hash House A Go Go. I was a bit put off by some of the mixed reviews for this restaurant, but in the end I trusted a friend who recommended the restaurant. We were all starving and couldn't wait to chow down on the great food. Boy were we disappointed! I (along with two others) ordered their star dish the Sage Chicken and Waffles. The presentation of the dish is pretty, but that's about the only good thing I can say about it. Overall the dish was under seasoned. While the chicken was fried well, it tasted just okay once I smothered it with the maple syrup. However, there was no redeeming the bland soggy waffles. Another person ordered the salmon smothered in a chili cream sauce. He said the dish was not great but wasn't bad. The last dish was a simple scrambled egg dish with a huge biscuit and plain hash potatoes on the side. The complaint here was that the huge biscuit was dense and dry. The scrambled eggs were okay but the hash potatoes had no seasoning. Our tab for brunch for five people was $140 (with tip). My regret was that we did not hang out at Batter and Berries for a couple of hours. At least they received great reviews. So disappointed!",2,MsOutandAbout,Chicago
"Having dined at HH in Las Vegas, I couldn't wait to return home and try HH in Chicago. Big difference in wait staff (Waiter lacked enthusiasm) and the portions MUCH smaller. Food was okay. Im going to wait and go back to HH Las Vegas.",3,Foodie,Chicago
The website is very misleading. It shows pictures and menu items that are for locations in order states.  The Chicago location if nothing more than a diner (an overpriced diner).,3,OpenTable Diner,Minneapolis
