Prix fix dinner before a play. Just delicious!! Space beautiful and a bit on the more formal side. Overall a delicious meal!!,5
Absolutey Amazing!!!!,5
"I went solo for lunch during Restaurant Week. I ordered the octopus appetizer and the grilled sea bream. The octopus was perfectly cooked; the texture was soft, and the char from the grill added a nice touch. It was complemented by the fava bean purée and a drizzle of olive oil. The sea bream was so fresh; it was simply cooked on the grill, highlighting the taste of the fish. I also loved the grilled bread and the freshly-snipped  oregano in the olive oil. I wish I could have eaten more slices! I found the overall ambience of the restaurant classy and peaceful. A very pleasant dining experience!",5
I booked a table right through the restaurant week section of your site. When I got there and we finally sat down I asked for the restaurant week menu. At first they told me they don’t Do restaurant week. And they send someone else over and they tell me they only do it for lunch. Very disappointed in being lied to. Please get back to me at 917-533-4800. You can easily see I booked it pushing on that restaurant week category.,4
All of the waiters are so accommodating - the food is absolute perfection - my favorite restaurant in nyc,5
"Great food, great restaurant - could be a little pricey but great overall.",5
I love the food so much!! The restaurant is nice and the staffs are helpful!,5
Granddaughter’s Birthday and Theatre evening. Everything from food to service was outstanding.,5
"I had a wonderful time. The food was delicious, the service and the ambience great.",5
My daughter and I celebrate our birthdays at Milos,5
every year.  We love this restaurant!,5
Ecellent experience as usual.,5
"I have been to Milos several times and although  pricey, the food is outstanding.  The fish is as fresh as could be with a large assortment from which to choose and the meat dishes are just as tasty.  don't miss the grill octopus appetizer and the Greek Salad!",5
Best seafood experience ever.  Highly attentive staff.  Only go if you ready to be impressed (and have the means to pay for it). ,5
Will definitely be back.,3
"The food and service was exception!  We had Grilled Octopus, a Whole Dorado and assorted desserts.",5
We has a reservation at 9 pm and they ended giving is the table around 9 30,2
"Excellent!! Stephanie was a fabulous server, nice, outgoing and very professional !! We will be back",4
I wanted to try this place for restaurant week lunch since they’re seafood based. We ordered the calamari and grilled octopus which was fresh and delicious but then we had to wait about 40 min for our entrees and mine was cold since I ordered the grilled veggies. The waiter said they were supposed to be served at room temp but it just didn’t make sense to me. I wouldn’t cross this off my list entirely but definitely wouldn’t order the veggies again and make sure you’re not in a rush.,5
"God is excellent, but the over attentive servers need to learn barriers.  They interrupted our conversation every 1 to 4 minuted.",5
Wonderful experience. Service was exceptional. Food was marvelous. Very diverse wine selection.,5
"Lovely lunch at Milos--great service, interesting and quality food.  Attention to needs.  Portions very nice.  We had a relaxed lunch and did not feel rushed.  Everyone was very gracious--will dine again at Milos.  Had pre-fix lunch--very good selection",5
It is our second time there and was outstanding again. It is our favorite steak house,5
The service and food were impeccable.,5
Great steak,5
"We had a fantastic time at Gallagher’s with our group of 4 on Wednesday for lunch. The food was delicious, service top notch and the ambiance couldn’t have been nicer.  We can’t wait for our next trip to the City to enjoy a wonderful not hurried lunch at your steakhouse.  Try the prix fixe for lunch!  You won’t regret it.   The steak is so tender you won’t need the knife!  Go and indulge!",5
This place used to be our favourite restaurant in the world but boy has it gone downhill.,2
"First of all, this was the third time that we have been told that the restaurant has sold out of Prime Rib. We got there at 7.30. How is that possible? Did they just not bother to prepare any?",5
"Second, the 'tomato and onion salad' was a joke. The onion was a massive white onion cut into thirds and served with nothing. The tomato likewise. $12 I think.",4
"Also, the gruff and curt serving staff thing use to work when they seemed to care about the place and the job and had a line in banter and fun but now they just seem gruff, curt, bored and rude.",5
Wont be back. Such a shame.,4
"Absolutely 5 star. We dined here for our last night in New York and this was by far the best evening we had. Fantastic food, great wine, service was Superb (thanks to Jim, best waiter in NYC!). Would highly recommend, must book as very popular!",5
There's no need to remind me that tipping is not included in the bill.  I know how tipping works.,5
Food was great and service top notch our waiter was a pro !,5
I took my wife for dinner before a show. The service was top notch. The wait staff was very attentive and knowledgeable.,4
Excellent selection of  well prepared food served by superior wait staff,5
"Amazing food, service, experience. Everything we could have asked for. They were great!!!",5
"Absolutely loved this place, everything was just perfect. Will definitely be returning.",5
"The experience was very nice.. late lunch with my sister who never really goes out to eat.. she was very impressed , myself not so much.. however I must say the service was excellent.. my lamp chop was a bit under done for my liking but they tasted great.. their lentils soup needed much to be desired but the nyc cheese cake is really the best I have ever eaten anywhere..  There are really a mature steakhouse and one really gets that feel",4
The meat was cooked perfectly. The key lime pie was very good. I can go back there just for the pie!,5
I am in NYC for business and I had a diner with my boss. ,5
It was the first time for me in your Restaurant and I had the best tuna steak of my life!!!,3
I really enjoyed the experience.,5
Only one word describes our experience. KILLER!,5
Amazing French onion soup! Everything else ok.,5
Not the steak I was expecting.,4
"We love Gallagher's and make a reservation whenever we feel like a great steak and wine. We have tried many steakhouses across the city and we keep going back here. The wines by the glass, or bottle are delicious. The burrata and roasted peppers is a flavor bomb in your mouth. My husband gets the ribeye and I get the NY strip (bone out) both medium rare, and its perfection every time. Creamed spinach or fries or brussel sprouts (have them add bacon if you dare) and your meal is complete. But not as complete if you have space for the key lime pie. Take your time and enjoy the experience.",5
Went there for Groupon lunch on Sunday. Paid extra $10 for 10 oz filet mignon and did not regret a second. Manhattan clam chowder which was soup of the day was also excellent. We were so full that had to take our desserts (New York cheesecake and key lime pie) home,4
"So the service was ok, but based on the the reviews we had much higher expectations for the food and the options offered.. Caesar salad was poorly made, steak was good, burger was ok.. I didn’t like the short rib with the sauce on top, the server was nice and changed it for the steak .. overall the place is nice but just like any other steakhouse, just didn’t feel there is any uniqueness to it",5
"We loved it. The service was spot on, the food was great, the wine selection was awesome. I would highly recommend this place and am already trying to figure out when's the next time I'll go. The meat was aged and cooked to perfection, was tender and moist, just the way it should be. The sides were flavorful and accompanied the mains well, and were in a good portion (not too big).",5
Decor was great.  Got seated right away despite being 10 min late to reservation.  Server was very attentive and the food was delicious.,5
"The food was amazing, the staff were really friendly",5
It was my second visit and better than the first.  My friends had the porterhouse for two and I had the boneless sirloin.  Very good!  Sides were also very good (mashed and creamed spinach).  They have an above average wine list with numerous bottles under $100.  I ordered a 2014 Gallina Barbera d'Alba (under a 100% mark-up!).  Service is solid as you would expect from the tenured staff.  You will not be disappointed with the place.,5
"My husband and I recently visited New York for a weekend and stumbled across Gallaghers Steakhouse. I'm so glad we did. My husband had the ribeye and I had the bone marrow filet. It was absolutely delicious, probably the best meat I've had. The sides are very large and sharable. It is pricey, but no regrets. You are getting great quality for your money. The next time we are in the city, we will definitely be visiting again!",5
Food and general service were good but we let our server know we had theater tickets and only had 90 minutes. The salads/appetizers were a little slow to be served and our entree’s didn’t show up until 15 minutes befor we need to depart  making it difficult to enjoy our meals. We neede to remind our waiter more than once.,5
John O,4
This was our second visit and Gallaghers did not disappoint. We will be back again soon.,4
The porterhouse for 2 is amazing! Best  onion rings hands down and I never use steak sauce but I wanted to drink it it was so good.,5
By far the best dining experience in New York. The best Porterhouse steak I have enjoyed! Well done and thanks to the team to make this a memorable evening!,5
Food was amazing!! Came here for restaurant week but quickly found out they do not participate during dinner time. It would have been nice to know that beforehand but the food was spectacular.,5
I have  dined here several times and always found the food delicious  and well prepared and beautifully presented. I  always  recommend  Milos to my friends and family . I also find the wait staff very attentive.,4
Food is always excellent and they have the most amazing wait staff.  Their fresh fish is as fresh as it comes,5
We went for NYC Winter Restaurant Week. Place is very pleasant but a little noisy at lunch time. Restaurant Week Menu Selection was very good ; the quality was there and main courses had been prepared with care. The service was efficient and professional.  We will go back.,5
Must visit when in NYC. Excellent food and service,5
"Estiatorio Milos, for most people, is a place to go to for special occasions. Fresh fish flown in from the Mediterranean will never be cheap, and those offered in this restaurant are as pricey as they are choice and impeccable. ",5
"For my birthday, I had a hankering for fish simply grilled with olive oil with a touch of lemon juice. Having dined at Milos before, I knew this was the place to go for it. ",5
"Though we now live in Philadelphia, my husband and I were in NYC for a recital at Carnegie's Zankel Hall, so Milos was very conveniently just around the corner. We arrived for our 6 p.m. reservations and were seated promptly (and without at quibble, though we reserved for three but ""lost"" our guest due to personal circumstances). ",5
"We had the mushroom appetizer---six kinds of mushrooms lightly grilled with a touch of salt---each kind retaining its character and taste---king oyster, shiitake and maitake were among the offerings. Per custom, we chose our fish from the day's catch at ""fish market;"" my choice was a ""Fagri"" a firm fleshed, well-flavored variety. It was served grilled  to perfection and deboned, with a scattering of capers and salt and a hint of herbs. Heaven! The only accompaniment we had was handcut French fries---greaseless and delicious.",5
"When people are having a good time, the joy spills to others, and we fell into conversation with the couple at the next table. It turned out they were also celebrating the wife's birthday so we exchanged greetings between contented sighs with each forkful of food. They had just returned from Mykonos, and friends there had suggested Milos!",3
"The high ceilings and big expanses of white give Milos an airy and lively ambiance. The service is marked by warm attentiveness---there always seems to be a wait staffer on hand to answer questions, refill glasses, make suggestions. We wish we had space for dessert but maybe next time. ",4
"We can't wait to go back, when our wallet permits.",5
"Phenomenal! Amazing food, amazing service. The ingredients were fresh and delicious, the presentation was stunning. Each dish was stellar. Servers were constantly attending our table, not letting the water get low and making sure we were constantly satisfied.",4
One of the best restaurants in New York.   We dine at Milos every visit to New York.,5
I lived in Manhattan for years and Milos was one of my go-to spots for dining.  Authentic and amazing are the two words that best describe the experience.,4
Delicious but the noise is a problem,4
Love Milos!!!!,5
The service was very slow.we started ordering at 17:30 and left the restaurant in a hurry after 20 almost missed our flight back home.there are many waiters and service people and the service was excellent just slow as mentioned.the dish of greek meze was quite simple and disappointing even though we like greek food and mezes in particular.the lamb ribs were good .we took a fish on the business menu that wasn’t so tasty.of the deserts the greek yogurt was very good.we didn’t like the cake.,5
Great food. But a very long lunch due to restaurant week menu at every table.,5
So the waiter was the pick of the day! He was the best I had a prefix dinner at 10.00 that he suggested and was simply perfect going next week again GREAT,4
Food was delicious and the right portion. Service was great.,5
"Beautiful food and great service! Let down by tables far too close together, could hear everyone’s conversations, shouldn’t be that close for the price you pay",4
"Too noisy and too crowded (tables very close together); food was good. Overall not as good as other steakhouses in New York (e.g Ruth's Chris, Smith & Wollensky, Capital Grill, Morton's).",3
Everything good. Relatively expensive,5
Terrible table very noisy ,3
Is not the first time  that eat there but  this time  they selected the wrong  table and room ,5
Great food...service friendly but just slightly off. The classic Nobu dishes are still on point. It’s a keeper...,4
Is the first time that i was sent to the 3rd floor ,4
Not too happy,4
Carrots were delicious.  We brought some guys from North Dakota and they enjoyed the entire experience.,1
Wanted to try an authentic NY steak house. It fitted the bill.,5
our prime rib came out raw.  we made a special order for it in advance so they would not run out and the waiter did not even mention it so we assumed he knew.  So they took it back and put it under the broiler and turned it into a steak.  There was no flavor.  No au jus taste whatsoever.  The bread basket was disappointing.  Where was the onion bread the pretzel bread and the bread sticks.  The waiter never came over to see if the prime rib was better.,5
"We’ve been to a lot of high caliber steak houses in New York and this one really disappointed!! Service was average, food was average, however the price portion was ridiculous! I’m used to expensive pricing for a really good Steak House, especially in NYC. But the over the top prices did not match with the service, food and total experience. Too many other Steak Houses to go to, will not be back.",3
"Keens Steakhouse was the only restaurant we felt we had to hit during this short trip to New York for meetings.  From the pipes on the ceiling to the Byzantine layout of the rooms to the pictures on the walls and the dark wood everywhere the place just feels good.  My t-bone was exceptional.  My colleague's filet was awesome, too.  Best to book a table a few weeks out.  We were lucky and able to get a 5:00 with only a day's notice.",5
I took VIP clients to Keen's for a business lunch and it was the perfect choice.  Service was attentive but not overbearing.  Tables were spaced far enough that you could have a nice conversation and not hear people from other parties.  Seafood appetizer and steak were both outstanding.  Overall it's a classy yet unpretentious restaurant with superb food and service.  It's not cheap but it's all well worth it.,4
Memorable historic building.  Average service and steak.  Tiny table for two.  Surprisingly uninspired wine list.  The crowd was touristy so not the best place for a business dinner either.  I was slightly disappointed when I left.,5
"We had Dover Sole, Mutton, steamed spinach, and a Wedge Salad (with a side of bacon).  Everything was perfect.  When we arrived they brought crudites with a lovely dip and some bread; service was attentive and unobtrusive; we had very nice cocktails (gimlet and old fashioned).  Love how quiet the restaurant was despite being full, my favorite steakhouse in new york by far -- though not having had steaks, we cannot speak to that! However they do dry age their own so imagine it's top notch.",4
Nice please to have perfect steak with interesting ambiance,5
The best steak I've ever had!,5
"Great vibe, beautiful and historic place.",5
We're coming back for our anniversary and decided it will be our spot for the annual celebration.,5
The ambience was great.,5
"Waiter was courteous, attentive and friendly.",5
Food was excellent and wait time negligible.,5
60th Birthday,5
"We were in NYC for 3 days and it was totally worth going to this restaurant. Food is amazing, waiters are nice!",5
I received a message that i did not make my reservation. I was in fact there.,4
Amazing food service and freshness,5
Very delicious,5
Fresh and hot food ,5
Nice Omakase,5
Grilled salmon option,5
Beef options,5
Always absolutely perfect in every way,4
Everything was delicious and flavorful and so fresh tasting!,2
"Nobu 57 never disappoints, the food and drinks are always amazing,",5
"Service, ambiance, and food were fabulous!  We had a wonderful meal with plenty of input from our patient waiter.  You can't go wrong with anything on the menu (we worked our way through half of it) so be adventurous!",5
"Disappointed they changed their tempura rock shrimp salad into what appeared to be a sharing appetizer. Their sashimi we have ordered for years upon years was served with skin and again, disappointed in the changes",5
"I usual don’t mind pay a lot for food as long as the food is good but this wasn’t the case here. Every dish I had was salty my friend order the fish bento box for $50 and the fish she got was cod, for $50 I expect at least a sea bass.",5
"Also they deliver our food at different times, so I watched my friend eat and she watched me eating my food.",4
"Very disappointing, scratch this place off the least.",5
"Our waiter had great advice about must get dishes. We shared a number of appetizers, then ordered sushi based on how hungry we were at that point. Great service!!",5
great high end food! great service and ambience...expensive but worth it,4
"Food sublime. Great sushi. Excellent wine list, but super pricey. Would love to see them expand wines in the 60$ range. Super fun ambiance. We had a blast at Nobu!!",5
"We were there to celebrate my stepdaughter’s birthday. She had always wanted, but had never been to Nobu. From the food to the service, attention to detail to the dessert surprise, it was a magical night. I comment the staff at Nobu for making another night at this location very special.",3
Food is delicious. Service is so-so. Loud and touristy but food is good.,3
Only complaint: We arrived early for our 5:45 pm reservation and we were told we could wait at the bar. We sat at the half booth with the little tables along the window which was great. Then the waitress told us our table was ready and we gave up the seats. When we walked over to the hostess she told us there was no early seating?? And the waitress had given up our seat at the bar. The service upstairs more than made up for any inconvenience. Our waiter was perfect. All the wait staff was incredibly attentive. Excellent food - especially the beef dishes. So tender and the sauce was delicious.,3
"Amazing food, and the service was excellent!!",4
"Good, but so expensive",5
Wedding anniversary,5
Food really was not that special for the price. Lobster shittake salad was delicious though.,5
Been to Nobu in Malibu and Vegas and had a amazing experience. The food and service at Nobu 57 was not at all good. I was disappointed with the quality of the food vs the amount t of my bill.,5
"We were 3 people & they kept bringing 1 persons meal at a time so when 1 finished there main course they brought the next persons ( really weird ) & the ambiance does not warrant the prices they charge ,  glad i went but not impressed at least it's off the bucket list",3
The best and delicious sushi and sashimi! Came here during lunch for our 10 year old’s Birthday.,5
Had the Nobu bento box for lunch. Fabulous flavors in 6 courses. Good wine. Desert was great as well. Expensive but worth it.,5
"Fantastic! We loved all. The food, the service, the ambiance.",3
"This was our first time at Nobu Fifty  Seven  and I must say that they exceeded our expectations by far. We have dined at Nobu in the Bahamas, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, but I think Nobu Fifty Seven is our new favorite in NYC. The food is great - definitely recommend trying the hibachi if the table is available and the setting is even better.",5
The sushi was incredibly fresh and delicious! Had an amazing experience. Will be back!,5
Price of tacos — $9/piece for something the size of half a Kit Kat — felt outrageous.,5
Great experience. First time with children-they were so accommodating!,5
Anniversary,3
Hostess rude and,5
Todo estuvo muy bueno! Si regresaria,5
Love the place - tho a tad expensive!,5
An historic occasion every time I eat at Keens and that day was historic in its own right as it was my birthday. ,5
The prime mutton chop was heaven for carnivores. I get hungry again thinking about it. Everything else was wonderful. ,5
Love the hot fresh sourdough rolls with veggies and blue cheese we always start with. ,5
This is the place to recapture NYC as it once was and will never be again,5
"My wife, 2 other couples and I visited this steakhouse on a Saturday night. We were here visiting on vacation and made a reservation well in advance. Everything we had was amazing. We had bacon as an appetizer and each of us got a filet. Cheesecake for dessert. The filets had to be some, if not the best, steaks we've ever had and I've visited a lot of steakhouses in Atlanta where we are from and elsewhere. The ambience is extremely relaxing and unique. Their wine list is very extensive, we got two excellent bottles. Highly recommend this place!",5
"Excelente ubicación excelente servicio excelentes mignones, Wine list ok, lime Cake delicioso",5
"We always used to get their signature dish:  Keens' mutton chop but now we cannot go to Keens without reserving their king's cut prime rib, medium rare, of course.  They are famous for their Bloody Mary, one of the best in the United States, by the way.  Their Caesar salad is a thing to behold and their key lime pie and hot fudge sundae are beyond comparison.  You are simply in for a grand treat eating here whatever the occasion may be.",5
The best steakhouse in NYC,4
"Absolutely delicious! Great atmosphere and attentive staff, but the FOOD! The lobster bisque was alright... everything else was stellar! Scallops cooked to perfection, my wife loved the filet, it was all so good.",5
"Four adult friends were visiting NYC for a long weekend.  Keene's was on our list of ""where we HAD to eat"", and it did not disappoint.  I'm pretty much a steak snob, and the quality of the beef was incredible.  We had 2 small filets (8 oz-not exactly small) and 2 shared the bone in porterhouse.  AMAZING is all I can say!  Would recommend to everyone.  Worth every penny!",2
BEST FRIES! FAST SERVICE! GIANT PORTIONS! GREAT SUNDAE!,5
Ristorante top ! carne perfetta. Organizzazione e professionalità,3
"Excellent steakhouse. Food was delicious, and the service was outstanding!",4
"Excellent service, food came out at the perfect time, everything was wonderful.",5
"What a gem!  Maybe the best sirloin steak I’ve ever had...hard sear on the outside and perfect pink on the inside.  Crudités on the table was nice touch.   Bloody Mary was mine drinking a salad! Portions are huge, so come hungry or take home some excellent leftovers.  Sides were good, and more than large enough to share.  Service was attentive and courteous.  We’ll be back!",5
I have been going to Keens for about 30 years ,5
- and that’s my review.,5
Loved this place. Going to miss it. Was there the last dinner service and just really sad that it's gone.,5
"so sad that it is now closed,  it's better than many.",5
It was a great memory and a fond farewell. Food was superb ! It will be missed!,5
Closing Wednesday 1/17/18. Can’t wait to see what Bobby Flay does next. I’ll miss this midtown spot.,3
"Loved the food, but the portions were huge.  Loved it again the next day.  The lamb was particularly delicious and cooked perfectly. Great night out.",5
"The food was excellent. It was disappointing that the restaurant was closing for good in 3 days. Several things that we wanted were ""out"" because of this.",5
Service was slow.  Had a reservation but still waited 15 minutes,1
Wonderful again. Heartbreaking it's closing,5
Wonderful!!  We’ll miss Bar Americain and so sorry it is closing. We’ve enjoyed it so much when visiting New York.  Hoping Bobby will open it back in another location!,5
We have enjoyed ---and been dining at Bar Americain for the last 12 years + since it opened---and we were so sad to hear they are closing the restaurant tomorrow after serving the last meal at lunch!!!    We understand it is another situation of the building owner that would not compromise on a new lease---and would rather see the space empty---sorry to hear---good luck to the great staff in finding new jobs!!,4
Our service was atrocious. If the Somalia needed to check on what was keeping our entres then there were major issues. Possibly the most distressing is that restaurant offered NOTHING for the inconvenience. A great restaurant had a VERY bad nights.,1
Underwhelming.... pricey,3
"The seating was a bit tight and therefore louder than I prefer; I couldn’t carry on a quiet conversation with my husband. The service was excellent; I appreciated the personal service I received. The pizza appetizer, fries, and profiteroles were worth the wait but the Philly steak was clunky and overpriced. I would revisit; I went because it was Bobby Flays restaurant and was very pleased.",3
"One of the best meals, I've ever had, much less in Midtown!",5
Great food once agaIn at one of our favorite NYC restaurants. Stopped by for a pre-theater dinner. The lobster and avocado appetizer is my favorite. I was dreaming of it since we booked our reservation. I had the mussels and fries for my entree. The only thing missing was the crusty bread to soak up the sauce. The staff is friendly and energetic. I strongly recommend.,5
"Though I have been to Bar Americain several times and have always enjoyed the experience, I am not sure I will return. My sisters and I were there last Saturday to take our mom out for dinner and a show as a gift for the holiday. We had a 6pm reservation and tickets to see an 8pm show up the street.  The food was fine but the service was abysmal. Our waiter asked us if we had any time limitations, to which we responded that we had an 8pm show, and then he disappeared. Our entrees didn't arrive at our table until 7:30pm - more than 90 minutes after we sat down.  WE flagged him down to inquire about our food and he seemed wholly unconcerned. He didn't apologize or explain. He just said he would check. He didn't come back. When we were finally able to get him again, we reminded him of our show and said we were hoping for time for dessert and it was getting tight. He said he would check and never returned. In the end, we had to rush through our entrees (literally not having time to finish), request the check while we were eating and dash out without having dessert or coffee. The waiter never offered up any apology or explanation about the situation nor did he comp us for any part of the meal. It was so disappointing and the stress about missing our show really got in the way of our ability to enjoy our experience. As if that wasn't enough, my sister left her credit card in the restaurant (because we were in such a mad hurry) and when she called the restaurant the next day to see if they had the care, the person she spoke with was completely unhelpful and merely said she hadn't heard about a card. She clearly didn't look nor was she going to. Overall, It was such a bad experience that I don't think we will ever be back and I plan to share this review far and wide. Given the cost of a meal at this place, the service should be outstanding. Sadly, the service (and thus the experience) was truly awful.",2
"Very underwhelmed. Heard its closing in a couple days, maybe that is why. Ran out of tap beer upon opening at 5pm. Waiter had not energy or excitement to be there. Steak served cold sent back. Bathroom had plastic container of soap. Mgr was only person that kept this from getting all 1's.",2
Great service and nice ambiance. Two top tables are too close together and you hear neighbors conversations too much. Penne a little underwhelming and “sampler” seafood app only had two shrimps. Otherwise great !,4
"We had a great lunch, as always, but I was very surprised to learn you are CLOSING FOR GOOD on Wednesday 17 Jan 2017. A great loss to the neighborhood.",4
"So sorry to see Bar Americain close!   Will miss their grilled meats, specialty cocktails, seafood tower.",4
"Very sad they are closing. Food was great, but the service was only okay. They are obviously in “shut down” mode. Under-stocked bar— under-staffed kitchen and servers.",4
Not worth the money. Wait staff was fine but food was terrible from starters to entree. Didn't stick around for dessert. First and last time.,1
Fantastic food and delicious drinks,5
"waiting so long to eat at a Bobby Flay restaurant. finally did appetizer, came out luke warm (shrimp and grits) Entree was delicious. The most disappointing was the service, it was not busy at all, wait staff standing near bar talking. Our waiter very unattentive. ",3
"As much as I am a fan of Bobby Flay, I will try again.",5
Great service and awesome steak,5
"Fantastic food, classic tribute to Bobby Flay’s complexed yet complementary flavor combinations",4
I’ve been here twice the first time was exceptional. This time the service was slow and unattentive and several of the dishes were just ok. The onion soup was amazing! I’d still recommend it but with a little caution since the experience wasn’t as great the second time.,5
BA always a good experience; terrific meal on a cold winter evening in NYC.,4
Excellent service and great food!  Location is great (Times Square)—-especially if you are staying at the Sheraton next door ;),4
Limited menu. A little pricey for the portion size.,5
One of the best dinners we’ve had. Creative and delicious items. Can’t wait to go back.,5
I love Bobby Flay’s restaurant.  Sad to hear it’s closing.,5
Food and service were execellant. Thanks for making my New Years Day so enjoyable,1
"Have been coming here with friends for 6 years on New Years Day and it was always a pleasant experience. My only complaint prior is that the menu was becoming stale. They actually removed a great dish from the brunch menu (full portion of shrimp and grits - now only avail as appetizer). They are closing their doors in 3 weeks due to a lease issue so this was to be our final visit. We were so disappointed today. The French Onion Soup tasted and smelled like an ash tray (something in it was burnt). The Tuna Tartar Toast Points were burned. The Kentucky Hot Brown had burned toast and was neither hot nor brown (it was ice cold). The Crab Cake Preakness Eggs Benedict was over cooked. They only charged for some apps and drinks, which in my opinion was too much for the experience. We understand that they are closing BUT it's Bobby Flay's reputation that is attached to it. I am sure if he would have been there today, he would have shuttered the place immediately.",2
"This restaurant is closing soon, so we wanted to visit one last time.  That was a mistake because the staff and kitchen have obviously already checked-out.  The restaurant was always one of our favorites, and we will remember all the great meals we have had there; but this last visit was not good.  Mr. Flay would not be proud.",5
"Went to Bar American after attending the Alvin Ailey New Year’s Eve dance performance with my husband and  a friend, what a great time was had by all.  The restaurant did not have a special menu for New Year’s Eve, which turnout to be great as we each order a different dish and shared, I had the chioppino  which was delicious with a kick to it, my husband had the pasta simple yet taste and my friend had the chicken which had a nice flavor to it.  We ordered the crepe and soufflé for desert and the staff provided us with champagne to ring in the New year and the noise makers.",3
As always Bobby restaurant’s never disappoints.,5
日替わりメニューのチキンカツを食べましたが、とにかくボリュームがあり、完食はできませんでした。,3
味も普通で飽きてしまいました。,4
"Not at all what I would’ve expected. The hosts sat us 45 minutes after our reservation, after seating 3 groups with the same time slot AHEAD of us. It wasn’t until I glared for the 10th time that they realized they had made a mistake. There was clearly open tables but they only had one or two bussers working. When we got to the table we had a waiter wait on us, then totally disappeared without even announcing it to us, followed by another lovely server coming and taking care of us which is honestly the only reason this review isn’t one star. The food was good, but I would not say it was spectacular. There was too much of a delay between courses when the restaurant wasn’t even that busy when we finally had gotten seated. We were seated at roughly 10:15 and didn’t get out of there until midnight. Really frustrating to have a restaurant be so inconsiderate of your time and not even acknowledge the fact that they made mistakes.",3
Great experience. Definitely recommend a return to family and friends,5
Working people not really interested in helping or serving.,1
We waited for more than 20 minutes without abolutely no assistance and just decided to leave the place.  No one was even capable to ask why!!!!,1
Will never return!,1
Service wasn't up to standard and host was very rude,2
Service was beyond horrible never have I finished a drink as well as have the bread cleared from the table before the server even came over to take our order. Sever never checked on how things were entrees came as we were still eating apps felts totally rushed!!,3
Lamb was over cooked.. almost rubbery really. Mac & Cheese was tasteless but cheesy. ,3
Waiter didn’t know the products well and tried to wing it. Had no knowledge of the tastes of the wine options. I asked for something sweet but red.. he brought me a Pinot noir that tasted like dirt and i still had to pay for it.,5
Service was alright. Food was great. Too loud to enjoy the experience. A lot was going on. Not a place for everyone.,4
"We went for Restaurant week and was made to feel bad that we were ordering off of that menu. The food was good but I am glad I didn't pay full price for some of the items. My steak was overcooked, tell tasty but not done to my liking.",5
I went here for restaurant week and ended up ordering from the regular menu. I was not crazy about the bacon appetizer but We ordered the ribeye steak for two with some sides for dinner and it was delicious. The entire meal was a bit pricey but I enjoyed my experience at this restaurant. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for a special occasion.,2
Delicious meal great value during restaurant week.,3
"Nice ambiance, awesome music & good service. All around great time 👍🏼",2
We ate at STK before a play and were very satisfied.  They asked about timing and we had plenty of time to get to the theater.,4
"The food was excellent, as was the service.",3
"When we sat down the music was loud, but the manager reduced the volume to a comforable level.",5
It was a good start but awful finish. Server forgot about us and food was a mix of good and mistakes.,4
Service was very slow even though the place was pretty quiet. My branzino was delicious though pricey. Was not impressed.,2
"The service was slow and the waiter was rude.  The tuna tartare was delicious and the drinks were good but that was about it.  The shrimp my friend ordered was tough and the salad was salty.  Another friend and I ordered the same salad that was either the wrong salad or missing something.  Neither of us ate it and explained why.  Nothing was done with the bill and when we asked for there to be, the waiter couldn't have been ruder.  Needless to say, it was not worth the $300 bill.",5
Dry aged steak was amazing. Cooked to perfection and the sides were cool,5
"I asked for a refill of water twice, watched a waiter working a different station walk right passed us to refill his customers water glasses and finally needed a sip of water so bad that I actually pulled my personal bottle of Poland Spring out of my purse and refilled my glass. I left the bottle on the table as a hint to our waiter. Five minutes later, our waiter came and refilled my husband’s glass. We left a 20% gratuity despite the fundamental lack of service. The pistachio crusted lamb was delicious.",4
"Amazing place decoration, ambience, food, drinks, etc. Everything was wonderful.",5
Food was good but our waiter was too slow.  He took a long time to actually get to us . And one point we had to search for him.,2
Waiter served us our check while we were still eating,3
The food was absolutely delicious. ,2
"The tenderloin was perfectly cooked, as well as the mini-burgers, and the tuna tartar. The desserts could use a little work, I was very unimpressed. ",4
"My only complaint is about the service. They may have been a little understaffed for restaurant week, but that is not going to stop me from coming back here. It's definitely worth a visit!",4
We ran late but they still honored our reservation and took us anyway..we were super grateful for that.It was a Great time!!We came to experience the restaurant week menu ..and the food was Good and the price even better! The dj was amazing..played some top 40 but also some oldies but goodies.The drinks were also made well and strong enough👌🏽,3
Great experience!,4
"Visited STK for NYC Restaurant Week and the experience was great. My family and I celebrated my brother-in-law birthday. From the food to the service and the atmosphere, we shared a great experience. I would recommend going with or without the restaurant week menu. Will be visiting again to try other dishes. ",2
One word!!,5
"ALSO, definitely a great place to celebrate a birthday, especially if it's past 9pm! Music is on point!",5
"The food is excellent, but the service is atrocious. There are plenty of venues nearby where, for the same price, you can get food that is as good or better and you won't have to deal with horrid service. I've been visited by waitstaff more at a Chick-fil-A than I was at this establishment. I will never return to this restaurant.",4
"We made a reservation, arrived on time, and then proceeded to wait for 45 minutes for a table. Our water glasses were empty for nearly the entire meal as the staff took unacceptably long to refill them. We had been seated for more than twenty minutes before we saw a waiter for the first time, and it was another fifteen minutes before bread was brought to the table.",5
"The music was so loud we had to shout at each other to be heard. I understand that there is a bar/lounge adjacent to restaurant seating, but the result of the arrangement is to make the experience akin to dining next to a DJ booth, and as a consequence, wholly unpleasant. The tables are far too close together and thus our already strained voices had to compete with the intolerably annoying diners seated less than one foot away from us. This may have been an aberration from the norm, but the other clientele were pretentious and rude - what I'd expect to find in college at a party hosted by a fraternity of ill repute. ",5
"This dining experience was more than disappointing, it was entirely unpleasant. This was the first and last STK I will visit. If you're considering a chain steakhouse, do yourself a favor and go to the incomparably superior Mortons. Alternatively, try one of the many other steakhouses in midtown that overwhelmingly outperform this establishment. I don't think I'd return here if I was paid to.",5
*Waiter a bit distracted.  ,5
"*Coffee and desert should have arrived at the same time.  *The desert presentation of tossing  cellophane packages of brownies on the table, as if it were an afterthought, was a bit insulting.",3
"Service was great, food itself was a bit disappointing. Had chicken sandwich, all batter and no chicken.  Disappointed.",5
"Great Food. We went on a Thursday evening. The noise level was 1000% There was a DJ spinning dance music! People danced and pranced. It was very very busy, slow service --possibly under staffed for the crowd they had. But the food was great, fresh and present well.",5
Excellent,5
妻の誕生日で来訪しました。最高の料理、サービス、雰囲気でした。,5
"Extraordinary--exquisite food, warm service.  Worth the splurge for a special occasion.",5
"Our first Michelin star experience! In a word, SPECTACULAR!",5
Great service and food.,5
Wonderful experience all around.,5
"We tasted twelve dishes between the four of us. The dishes were of sufficient size for each of us to have a portion of each dish. The presentations were beautiful. The Fois Gras and the Sea Urchin were both outstanding , nine others were close behind, and one(the Veal) only very good. Great service. It’s pricey, but if you go for lunch, it’s less so. Get dessert! It’s a deal for $12. Two of our party are chefs in pretty nice establishments and suffice it to say, it was “a kid in the candy store” two hour lunch. Most enjoyable! PS: We had 18-20 dishes to choose from, all of which, were on the dinner menu which only slightly larger.",5
"Simply, the best lunch and dining experience I’ve ever had.  The food was original and gastronomically prepared.  I will dream of eating here again!",5
Phenomenal experience & cuisine. Ordered off alacarte with some customization. Our splendid waiter was quite helpful with specifics & my own wine pairings by the glass. Some not even on the menu. Our table for two was recessed and so romantic. Service was impeccable. The discreet remembrance of my wife’s birthday was quite nice with a custom dessert to accompany the one we ordered. ,5
Everything we had - we loved. Truly amazing was the Toasted Egg Yolk with Beluga Caviar. Followed by  Sea Urchin with Serrano & Yuzu tasted so fresh you thought they just took it from the waters off Sicily. The Waygu tenderloin was to die for. ,5
You will not be disappointed with anything on the menu!,5
Excellent for lunch.  Outstanding food and service.,5
Excellent! The food was expertly prepared and presented and the staff was very informed and attentive.,5
Amazing experience! Extremely professional service and the food was awesome! A bit pricey but well worth it!,5
Birthday meal,5
Everything about the evening was special.,2
My wife and I really enjoyed dinning here. The food was delicious and the service was attentive and professional. The ambience is just right.,5
Fantastic dishes，especially chocolate and orchard dessert,5
"They parked a champagne bucket ""truck"" right in front of my booth- table obstructing our view! I gently asked if they could move it to side and they said no and it will remain there for remainder of evening! Unbelievable!  $1k+ View! We won't be returning... Simply Rude.",5
Birthday  for my wife,5
Lovely birthday celebration,5
"The food and experience was phenomenal from start to finish. The caviar with egg was utterly amazing. Our captain Eric was excellent, very personal and attentive.  The experience was everything we imagined and can’t wait to go back in the Spring.",5
Wait staff were amazing.,2
"Impeccable service.  I’ve never been treated better at a restaurant.  This was my first time at a restaurant of this caliber and I almost expected the atmosphere to be a little snotty.  On the contrary, the staff was warm and friendly with a very professional manner.  ",4
The food was much the same as the service.  Devine!  No other way to describe it.  Mushroom market salad was to die for!,4
"Michelin’s downgrade to 2 stars is now viewed by this diner as a political move due to the location of JG within Kim Jong Trump’s Columbus Circle tower and not a reflection of any change in quality as our recent dining experience attests.  JG was stellar as usual in our 20 plus meals there over the past 15 or so years.  Yep we hold our nose and hide our face more than before 2016 when entering JG but what a fine oasis exists once in.  Glorious dining space, attentive professional service, wonderful beverage program,  exciting dishes - observe Michelin’s downgrade at your own peril.  We’ll be back!",2
I felt the service and all the courses except the main entree were exceptional. Two of us ordered the beef tenderloin and both were so salty that it was inedible . My wife ordered the sea bass. She said it was just an awful combination of  being too sweet and salty. We chose not to say anything because we were celebrating a birthday but felt like we should have just because it was so unusual for that to have happened.   Every other course was amazing and just what I have always come to expect while dining there. I’m not sure what happened but it was disappointing,3
"Two of my family was intoxicated, they was sick for two days",5
Excellent food but rather poor deserts.,5
"Service was not good and good was disappointed, definitely I don't recommend.",5
"Atmosphere  and service fantastic. We could not say the same with the food. First the good: oysters, and diver scallops and foie gras brûlée absolutely fantastic. Lobster with noodles was excellent. My wife ordered the duck breast  and it was gamey but she did NOT send it back should have. I had sweetbreads, and although what I ate of them was VERY tasty but they were mostly undercooked. Again, I should have sent back but did not. ",1
"Deserts wonderful but just too much. I ordered the dark chocolate dessert and my wife the Orchard desert. Excellent and one could easily have been shared. Too much because they also brought chocolate  candy, nougat and fresh jelly candy, and fresh marshmallows. Then before we left more candy. A great experience to have once, but we would not go back. Frankly on the overall we were very disappointed. When you spend close to $400.00 for dinner for two the one think you do expect is fantastic food, and that is just not what we got.",5
The lunch experience here is arguably superior to the dinner tasting menu back in May. Love it more much more than Gramercy Tavern!,4
"Absolutely magnificent—up to its reputation and then some. One of the most memorable meals we have ever enjoyed. Each dish is prepared with imagination, sophistication, and great care. Try the transcendent crab risotto, the divine pistachio-coated black bass, the best duck ever, ingenious sashimi. Service impeccable, friendly, professional. All raves and no reservations from our very happy table.",5
Great place and excellent food.,4
"Arrived with my wife on time for our 5:30 pre-theater, Birthday dinner reservation Tuesday 12/26. I could expand on the unevenness and rush of starting portion of service but don’t want to bury the lead.",5
"After pleasantries, menu discussion, wine order and the obligatory discussion of food sensitivities and allergies (mine, in detail, the adult allergy onset and anaphylactic shock response to fish), dinner was ordered. A minute later our server returned to confirm my fish allergy. ",5
"A couple of minutes later, engaged in conversation over our wine, the server emerged with the amuse bouche, described so fast as to not find the words discernible. Yes I interrupted discussion to take a mindless bite, looked st the fish, called the server back and asked “what did you say this was?”",5
"It was Skate, and my panic started to set in. While it had been 20 years since I knowingly or mistakenly had eaten fish the fear of  anaphylactic shock onset was palpable. While I often had joked that it would be great if I were mistakenly and unknowingly served fish and found I was no longer allergic, I didn’t choose or want to take the unknown risk. ",5
Great food but slow service and you feel treated like cattle,4
"One of the best Asian restaurants in New York City. Great decor and ambiance. The bar is stunning, other-worldly, and huge. Service is fantastic. Wonderful experience every time I go.",5
Excellent Ambiance and Great Food.   I wish Hakkasan had valet parking as mentioned on the web site.,5
Very underwhelmed by the restaurant week menu. Paid a lot for average food. Bummer!,1
"Good place to be nice food, nice ambiance...",5
"I chose this restaurant after  a NY Times article that mentioned the fortune cookies (as good a reason as any for choosing a restaurant in NYC).  We had a wonderful lunch (the dim sum) and the food and service was excellent.  When the check came, I mentioned the fortune cookies and was told they only serve them at dinner.  I said I was sorry to hear that since it was the reason I picked the restaurant.  The hostess just shrugged and walked away.  Put a bit of a damper on an otherwise lovely meal in a beautiful place.  For a $125 lunch I think she could have found one in the kitchen??",4
Mikhal was a wonderful server!,4
Outstanding in all ways. We will definitely return.,5
"Not your everyday Chinese food, but whoa pricey! And be prepared for service with attitude. All in all, food was really tasty and presentation was nice too.",4
Pre-show dinner,5
"Waited over an hour for the food to arrive, in a relatively empty restaurant. When I complained to the manager, he couldn't care less.",1
We decided to try out Hakkasan during Restaurant Week.  A good decision since we didn't spend too much.  Food taste was fair at best and service was disinterested and sporadic.  I won't return and will not recommend.  Best left as a tourist trap.,3
Awesome food - great for small and large groups ,4
Highly recommend,2
The Pecking Duck is good,4
"However, the design of the restaurant is confusing. There are blue, watery lights and Chinese window framing, which don't match at all. The music is not pleasant. ",2
The rest of the food is fine but overpriced,3
The fortune cookie as macaroons are creative but they don't taste good. The messages in the fortune cookies are discouraging and pointless.,1
"Buona molto buona, un po’ sotto Shangai londra Abu Dhabi",4
Food disappointing but the lotus drink was memorable.,5
Great Food. don't go during Restaurant week! took us 45minutes to get our table and a further 30mins for our drinks to arrive.,5
great food when it did arrive. but don't come if you're in a rush.,5
I made a reservation 2 weeks prior to my dining visit. The restaurant was crowded as expected however they severely lacked proper staffing. Food clearly took far too long to bring out & even when they finally did serve the main course they neglected to bring the side rice which accompanied the main dish which took 25 minutes to then bring. I finally went over & spoke to the general manager & expressed my great disappointment. I dine out very often for both business purposes as well as for pleasure & I must say this was far below poor. Thumbs down big time,5
As a Chinese，I like this restaurant.,5
Soup really have crab meat.,4
Main course is served with jasmine rice and vegetable.,5
Desert is also good.,2
Service is good. ,5
btw the gate is too heavy to pull or push.,5
The dessert were so gorgeous! Strongly recommend it!,1
"Enjoyable night at  Hakkasan New York,very similar to the Mayfair London restaurant ,Excellent food and great value,and ambience in the restaurant matches the food and value.Well worth a visit!!",5
Great food. Excellent cocktails at the bar. Service was impeccable. Food very well presented. All dishes were delicious but the Peking duck was outstanding. Great wine and good direction from the sommelier. A special place to eat really good food!,2
Thank you for your services,5
This beautiful restaurant never fails to please and awe us. The design is gorgeous; the food is delicious and the servers are gracious. The lunch is a bargain considering the wonderful quantity and quality of the sushi. I have ordered small plates which are very unusual. The fresh fruit drinks are also tasty. This is a not to miss experience.  Hakkasan is hiding in plain sight on a rather run down block which also houses the Second Stage Theater. Don't miss it!!!!,4
The second course of the caviar duck is a bit too salty. Other courses are great.,4
"We did a pre theatre meal before a broadway show. We were so impressed by the service, amazing food and creative cocktails. The best dim sum I have ever tried.",5
We were very frustrated that we arrived at the restaurant for restaurant week only to be told that they only offered it for dinner.  The Open Table reservation system did not indicate that when I picked that time of day.,5
Great food for RW,4
"Fabulous all around - love the ambiance and vibe.  Got us out on time to make curtain, lovely staff, just a great place to meet with friends.",3
The service was terrible - we had to call the waitress at least three times to get out attention. The food was cold,5
Absolutely amazing!!!,5
Been there many times. This is the one time this place was off,4
Perfect !!,5
"We waited 70 minutes for our salads and appetizers to come out, and had to order the same glass of wine 4 times before it came out.  They totally forgot one desert, and no one ever checked to see if we needed anything.",2
"One person in or party needed an elevator to go up the 3 sets of steps to our table, but alas, even tough the restaurant is on 4 levels, there is no help for those who can't climb stairs.",5
"And all through it, our server made us feel like he was doing us a favor to bring the late food.",5
Definitely would never recommend to anyone!,5
Amazing. Fantastic food and atmosphere,5
What a fabulous way to spend my birthday!,5
The atmosphere is energetic.  The design of the interior is unique and lends itself for areas to feel intimate.,2
The porterhouse is outstanding!,5
"Fabulous dinner at Quality Meats for my daughter’s birthday. The food, service and ambiance were fantastic. The sticky toffee pudding and fig ice cream might be the best thing I’ve ever eaten. I cannot recommend this restaurant enough.",3
Everything was excellent except the waiter was older and had no personality,5
"The hostess can use some customer service training. But other than that, Great service form servers and great food!",5
Had a booking but still made us wait for 30mins with poor attitude. Don't bother running a restaurant if you don't know a thing about service,2
"We went initially because it was Restaurant Week. We were informed upon arrival that they were not participating even though the reservation was made on Open Table on Restaurant Week links. Anyway, the place was crowded and very noisy. The service was very good.  The food was tasty and the drinks were amazing. While the food was not the best, it was far from the worst and I would likely dine there again.",5
QM jammed our table of 3 next to a table of 20 in a secluded corner.  It was difficult to talk to the guys at our table unless you yelled.  The servers kept apologizing but that didn’t prevent them from focusing their attention on the bigger table.  Definitely not worth the price and an overall poor experience. We won’t be going back.,4
From the moment stepping into Quality Meats the service was impeccable. The bar is a great place for a group to gather in then we were shown to our table upstairs when the group was all there. Food selection is amazing and the bacon/peanut butter was outstanding.,3
The wine chosen for us matched the meal perfectly and everyone had a great time.,5
"Quality Meats' interior is amazing. The hostess was very friendly and greeted us upon entry and made us feel very welcome.  We were seated upstairs which is very cozy.  Our server ""Burdi"" was very attentive and available every time we looked up he was there.  He also made sure our food was right and that the wine was appropriate. Burdi had the perfect balance and took great care of being friendly without being too familiar.  Management take note of that because it is a truly an asset in the restaurant industry! Overall great experience, great wine, great food and amazing desserts try the burnt marshmallow! Only downside is bathroom is way downstairs. Definitely recommend for enjoyable dining experience lunch or dinner.",5
Good staff. Very mediocre steak. Too pricey for the food offerings. Sashimi appetizer was a waste.,3
Superb Steak!,4
The service could of been better. Seem the Waiter was overwhelmed only came to our table 3x in an 2hr stretch.,5
disappointed w/the quality of the ribeye. way too much fat,4
"Very special restaurant. The service is the best and the food perfect. First time here, but will come back many times.",5
Jeff was very accommodating and took great care of us!,5
Long. Wait for entrees with little to no attention from staff while we waited.,5
Amazing ! Delucius !,4
"We love Quality Meats, the food, service, ambiance is PERFECT! We usually go there for special occasions, date news and when we have friends and family in town. We have never had a bad meal here. Once they even forget to give us our leftovers, but by the time we reminded them they had tossed them away - so the offered to offered to make a new one for - and it was one of their higher priced items. The staff - especially waiters are super attentive and nice! We went for my husbands birthday and they gave us the dessert on the house. Can't say enough good thing about this gem. Thank you Qaulity Meats for always making our nights special.",5
"When booking this reservation we were very optimistic that dining gluten free would not be a problem.  Unfortunately, the choices of beef were incredibly limiting because every steak is marinated in soy sauce. The steak choices immediately became few and far between with only a filet mignon as an option. We settle for a pork chop, which was amazing, as was everything else we were able to order; from the charcuterie, to the lobster scampi, to the desserts and cocktails. Our service was outstanding. Regardless of the immense disappointment we experienced not being able to enjoy a steak at Quality Meats, we would return for all the other elements offered.",5
"If you're willing to overlook the prices, the food was amazing, and our waiter made the experience even better. He picked out his favorites from the menu and did not steer kit group wrong. The restaurant itself has great ambiance. Overall, fantastic dining experience!",1
Great service and food,5
Great!!! Love the food !!!,5
Quality changes each visit.  Sometimes excellent sometimes fair.,4
Great space.  Professionals.,5
I have been to Quality Meats on every trip to N.Y . and entertained customers and friends and it is always a perfect meal and people return to dine there ofter.,2
Bravo to Quality Meats .,5
"I have eaten at QM many times. Unfortunately this time was a real dud. The waiter came once and that was it; otherwise we had to flag down lower staff to order anything, send the wrong orders back, get the check.",5
"We ordered sparkling water, but got tap. One of the main courses we ordered wasn't what we ordered. ",5
Just an unpleasant experience DEFINITELY not worth the bill. Will continue going to BLT Steak instead.,3
Solo me retrasaron una hora mi reserva,5
Good for date,5
"Food  was great, but service was okay. It was offensive our waiter started to clean the floor before we left the table.",4
Great service and the food was excellent.,5
Absolutely amazing food. The staff are extremely generous and kind to you. Everything was perfect. A little pricey but I was ready to pay a high bill before even getting there. By hey.. what do you expect for a high end steakhouse in the middle of NYC. ,5
Al in all 1000% worth it,5
"We went during restaurant week. Even though it was clear that we were not business men on an expense account we were treated as if we were.  The food was excellent and the service was spectacular. It was an exceptionally good value due to the restaurant week pricing, But there was a reasonable business man's lunch on the regular menu",5
This was my 7th time here but it was my best friends 1st time . She loved the decor all the way down to the dessert. We were at a great table with the best view of all the buildings along avenue of America’s (6th Avenue) including radio city music hall. Me and her booked our reservation through open table for restaurant week but when we arrived we were notified that we could not order food from the restaurant week prefix menu because it wasn’t available for dinner (only lunch). I was a little discouraged because that wasn’t explained on the website but our waitress managed to fix the minor issue and offer us something close to it. She was very nice & personable. We recieved a 3 course meal for $60 each (well worth it). We had Cesar and their house salad which had the most delicious avocado ranch dressing on it topped with a well done slab of cured brown sugar smoked bacon on it. We also had the salmon & fillet midallions with the famous Lobster mac and cheese for our main course. For the desert we had a creamy chocolate mousse and cheesecake that was to DIE FOR!! The service was phenomenal. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for 5 star quality service and delicious food. It is a little on the expensive side but it’s worth every penny. Thank you for making my best friends 1st experience here special. We’ll be back soon❤️,5
Absolute best as always,4
7 big guys and a cramped table upstairs in the corner by the window...only complaint! Management should’ve been able to help us out somehow...food and service were excellent!,1
"Service was awful!!!  Waitress kept claiming she was ""sick"".  Cut of filet mignon had fatty pieces and it was super small.    I would not recommend this place at all.",5
I have eaten here many times. Back in 2008 we had our sons graduation party after he finished his West Point degree.  Very special place for our family!  This time it was our 30th wedding anniversary!  Received a signed card from the staff ❤️ Can’t say enough good things about Del Frisco’s!! A must for every visit to NYC!!,5
"I always enjoy me meals at delfrisco, they have the best steak.  I took my friend there in honor of her retirement.  We had the best time ever.  My friend was really impressed and I'm sure she will return as i will.",4
"Overall, a wonderful experience, as usual!",5
"At Del Frisco’s, I look forward to the steaks. The steaks are  expertly cooked to your requested temperature. For Rib eyes, I recommend medium to caramelize the fat just a bit more or in general medium rare. The service was engaging but not intrusive. My water glass was never empty... Excellent. Thus is s must go to impress or to celebrate in style.",4
A good experience with restaurant week!,5
Mashed potatoes and cheese cake were delicious!,5
"For fellit steak, I think it's in normal standard.",5
The staff was professional and knowledgeable about the menu.  Great ambiance!,4
Celebrated birthday and watched the Superbowl.  Great table setting near bar area.  Waitress/staff very attentive.  Presented me with a beautiful and delicious birthday desert.  Thank you Del Frisco's.,5
One of our favorite restaurants! Ashley our waitress was excellent and spot on with her recommendations and service.  The only draw back was that the restaurants was very cold and we could've used a little heat.  Other than that zero complaints.,4
I have going to del frisco for the last 15 years..Love the steak and crab cake.,3
We ran a little late and they held the table for us even though we were about 5 minutes past their 15 minute grace period. They were quite busy but accommodated our late arrival and we were directed to their upstairs bar where we waited about 10 minutes before our table was ready. The cocktails were great and it was nice that there was a large TV upstairs. I made a reminder to myself to possibly return for their bar and bar menu during baseball season. ,5
"The service was spot on and the food was very good. We were not rushed to go through the courses and we were not pestered by over anxious waitstaff either. We had the bacon for an appetizer which we highly recommend if you like smoked meat. The wedge was nice, but what you would normally expect  but it was exactly what I wanted it to be; crisp lettuce, chunky blue cheese, and crunchy thick bacon. The onion rings were great, not too oily and they reheated nicely the next day. The cauliflower was good, but a touch too ""funky"" for me to go with the dry aged steak. Both our steaks were cooked perfectly to medium rare. The chocolate souffle at the end was overcooked and more of a flour-less chocolate cake than a souffle but was still tasty.  We brought our own bottle of wine for a $50 cork fee, which was great considering there are some competing restaurants in the city that do not allow outside bottles. Overall it was a fantastic experience and we will definitely be returning.",5
"I had made a reservation over a month ago for my boyfriends birthday. The food was very good but our seating area wasn’t. We were shoved back in a side room, away from the true ambiance of the Del Frisco experience, which made for a less than overwhelming experience.",4
"My visit was for a Special Occasion, this is not the spot for a Quiet Conversation or Romantic Evening.  We were seated close to the Bar side of the restaurant which could have been part of the problem , but the restaurant was aware that my reservation was for a special anniversary and could have seated us in a different section of the restaurant.  The restaurant did give us a Celebration Desert plate at N/C.",5
"Consistently one of the very best steak places in Manhattan.  The steaks for our party of four were perfectly cooked, tender, and well seasoned.  The sides were similarly outstanding.  Always a fun evening at DelFrisco’s.",5
"My boyfriend and I had an unbelievably amazing experience there on Saturday 2/3/2018. I can't wait to come back. The food, drinks, and service all exceeded our already high expectations. I can't celebrate the wait and kitchen staff enough. What a dream the whole experience was.",5
"Food was phenomenal, service was a bit stuffy. Great people watching view from the second floor",5
I brought my friend for her birthday.  ,2
Everything from ordering food to paying was a great experience. ,5
In my opinion I wouldn’t go any where else to have a superb steak dinner.,5
"Beautiful setting, delicious food, attentive and knowledgeable waiter!! A bit pricey but the total experience made it worth every penny! We mentioned that it was my sons birthday and the waiter surprised us with a birthday cake/dessert platter for him, big enough to share!! So sweet!",5
Great Steakhouse~Highly recommend!,5
Always great,5
The runner brought our bacon and prime rib to table next to us. When they carried plates. The back of plate touches the steak. Unacceptable.,4
"Great birthday experience, everything tasted amazing. Service by Sara was awesome.",4
"If you like steaks and/or seafood, this is your restaurant. The food is fantastic, the service is wonderful, the wine list is huge, and you’ll leave full and satisfied. Yes - it’s expensive...but - in my mind - worth the price.",5
"A very nice place. Let’s start off with they had our reservation and no waiting. We were seated right away with a nice view. Del Frisco is spacious so no one was on top of each other and me and my other was able to have a conversation. The bread was delicious crispy in the outside and soft on inside and hot. The butter was nice and fluffy. We ordered the oysters on half shell and king crab legs for appetizer, the wagyu tomahawk chops and Brussels sprout for dinner and chocolate soufflé cake, espresso double shot and tea.  The oyster and crab legs was fresh. The first problem was the wagyu tomahawk chop was crispy outside (nice) but when you cut into it there was way too much fat. We told the waiter (I think his name was Joel) he brought over one of the manager who saw how fat it was and offered another steak but by then we were a little turn off so they told us it would not be charge. We felt bad and wasn’t trying not to pay so we decided to order a dessert. Problem number two was the dessert came and no espresso or tea till after the dessert was done. We found the dessert dry like it had been sitting a while because the molten chocolate had already dried into the cake and wasn’t flowing any chocolate from the middle. But Joel was nice enough to get the dessert, espresso and tea taken off also. So not the best on the food this time but the service was great and really nice of them to take off the bill everything that was not great. The bill came to about $135 and we gave Joel a $65 tip for trying. We definitely will be back to try something else and hopefully it will be better and get to pay the entire bill. Thank DelFriscos for the great service and see you soon!",5
"My experience whenever I go to Del Frisco’s is beyond amazing. Their service is amazing, their food is amazing. Everything about them is just amazing! I’m always raving to my friends about them how great this place is.",5
"Have eaten here many times but for some reason this visit the service was fair. Waiters standing around and had to ask several times for bread, beverages, and coffee. Seems as though no one wanted to take responsibility in serving.",4
The food is as authentically Italian.  The server was efficient  and friendly.,5
Food was very good  service was great ,5
would recommend,5
The dining space was great. With an ambiance I did not expect. The dining staff were efficient and marked into the background however they were available at a glance. ,4
"The bar was cozy, well stocked and on this particular night populated  by a crowd of characters. ",5
I can't wait to return.,5
"Easy pre-theater. Northern Italian, not fancy but fast and consistent. For midtown it is a good choice for a quick business lunch with colleagues or a pre-theater meal.",4
Frequently eat here. Food is great! Service was good. Sometimes we get the same waiter.,3
Consistently delicious food. We were a party of four this time. We all ordered different entrees.  All of us extremely pleased with our selections. The service is impeccable. Wait staff and bar staff very friendly and courteous. The ambiance is very inviting.,1
Great food and service and 5 minute walk to Rockettes!,5
We had a reservation and were seated right away. Plenty of staff. Our waiter was very good. The food was mediocre. Tasted like everything came from a can.,4
After reading the reviews we were looking forward to a delicious dinner. The  overall service was deplorable. The waiter was rude to the point we almost left. This is the first time I have left a review but the experience was beyond disappointing and the food is mediocre at best.,4
Loved it a lot,3
We came Christmas Eve. Food was good and service was paced just right.,5
"Initial service was quick.  Waiter kept pishing us to order.  Appetizers came very quickly as did the main course, then service slowed.  Never offered a second drink during entire visit.  Food tasty, but not exceptional.  Convenient to theater district.",5
"As a Family of five staying in midtown, this was an an easy, casual dinner option. We booked ahead which means we didn’t need to wait ages for a table. No kids menu but ordered the tortellini soup which kids enjoyed. Chicken Fancese was ok, too lemony but not bad. Enjoyed the cozy atmosphere, comfortable seating and wine! Server was a bit gruff (stereotypical New York “attitude”) but we were so tired and hungry we didn’t care.",5
Christmas celebration,4
Excellent food. Everybody (15 persons) enjoyed their evening.,5
We had a reservation and got seated immediately even though the restaurant was packed because it was a Saturday night ten days before Christmas. The ambiance was wonderful and the food was absolutely delicious. I had the shrimp scampi and it was the best that I have ever had!!!,4
"We made reservations and arrived early. The hostess seated us within 3 minutes of arriving.  I asked the waiter is the fried calamari good, bc I’m very picky about my calamari. He said it was very good... and it was !  I also wanted to order the linguine frutta Di mare, again I asked, is it good. He replied excellent, and it was. I like my pasta a bit more al dente, and the large shrimp that came w the dish were a bit over cooked but overall the dish was very good and very tasty !! I would def go back !",5
Excellent choice for dinner. Had had the spaghetti with red clam sauce.....it was out of this world. I WOULD definitely go back!!,5
The service was great.  The waiters were attentive and very friendly.  But the food was just ok.  My husband and I had the salmon served over a chick pea salad which did not include any pasta and it was very good.  My kids had shrimp scampi and pasta with meatballs and they were just ok.  Ironic that the dishes without any pasta were the best ones.,5
Staff was wonderful. Waiter so attentive.  Great variety of food to choose from price wise which when with a group is great.  Pasta was delicious,4
We were able to dine on a Friday evening and not feel rushed! The food was delicious!,5
What a find!!! Just happened upon this restaurant and EVERYTHING was GREAT....,4
Our reservation was for 1PM and we were graciously seated at 1:01!!! WOW...,5
"I had the best chicken parm sandwich, my friend had the chicken francese that she described as scrumptious. My other friends had soup and salad that was REALLY GOOD...",4
The servers were so polite that I told the gentleman at the front door that the guys werE unbelievable...,2
JUST A FANTASTIC EXPERIENCE...THANX!!!!!,4
We WILL be back..........................................,3
"The food was delicious and the atmosphere was nice.  Unfortunately,  the wait staff was not the best.  I had no clue who my waiter.  I wasn’t greeted, and I was shuffled between two people.",4
Great food fast friendly service nice selection reasonably priced,4
"Everything we ordered was delicious: margarita pizza for appetizer was perfect! The fettuccini Alfredo w/chicken, peppers & peas - great flavors. My husband ordered the chicken Parmesan which was tasty too but he liked my fettuccini better ;) Our waiter was very attentive without rushing us - which is important to me. The Holiday music, the decorations, delicious meal, great service, great meal!",4
I go here whenever i visit the city. I love it...wait staff is as awesome as the food.,4
Week break in New York.... wanted different places to eat.  Found this place by accident when we cut down a street but ended up going back twice as the food was good and a reasonable price.,4
"The waiter basically ignored us and the order that he finally brought out was incorrect. He took forever to give us even a glass of water.  I remembered being in the restaurant previously and had a great experience, but not so much this time.  There are other restaurants in the  area to chose from next year.",3
If the three meals my chicken parmigiana was the best.  The pizza was good just not at that price.  Wine was good. Desert and coffee great,4
"It was a busy Saturday night.  We have 815 reservations but arrived a bit late due to a delayed train. Happy to find they held a table for us. It was all downhill from there.  Waited ten minutes just to get a menu. Another 15 after that before our order was taken.  All other tables were given bread baskets except for us and the table next to us.  Apparently they had forgotten until we asked. Food was good and the atmosphere was nice.  Bathrooms was extraordinary clean it’s too bad given the ample amounts of waitstaff and people bussing tables that they are so disorganized to the point where no one isbsjre who got drinks,menus or bread. But when the credit card was put down it was taken within 30 seconds... but a water refill I had to flag someone down.  Disappointing.  Maybe during non Christmas season they can handle the chaos better",4
"Busy holiday season- good things big we had a reservation! Food good, a little pricey for pasta",4
"Great food, ambiance and excellent service!  Can't wait to go back!",5
"Pork chop is always the way to go. Our waiter Charlie was awesome 👏 😎sauce attentive, caring & always there when we needed him.",4
Great! Highly recommend!,5
Soooo good! Love this place. Love it more every time I go.,5
"The place is nice, food is okay , service is not that good",4
Quality Italian was a vibrant and energetic restaurant with the food and staff to match.  ,5
My wife and I ended up splitting a large tomahawk ribeye that was perfect for the 2 of us and cooked to perfection. The wait staff made excellent recommendations from both the wine and dinner menu.,5
"All in all, a great night out!",5
Best date ever.,5
Excellent lunch including eggplant meatballs.,4
Very good food.,5
"Service was amazing. And the food was great as well. I personally got the spicy lobster pasta and the fact that they pan fry the lobster with wine right in front table side is amazing. The main dining area is a bit loud; however, there is a back section which is much quieter and easier when talking with others in your party.",4
Wednesday night but still quite a buzz. Our server was excellent. ,2
Wish there were some less expensive bottles of wine.,4
Everything was wonderful from the food to the service. The only suggestion I would have is to lower the music and/or change the genre. I believe the music was hard rock and the bass was a bit overwhelming.,5
Good food not great.  Have been many times for dinner (chicken parm is delish) but lunch was just ok...,5
"First time at this restaurant that came with great recommendations and it did not disappoint.  The setting is casual steakhouse, with plenty of options on the menu for those who are not steak eaters.  Cocktails pre dinner at the bar were well prepared (fever tree tonic our favorite) and the bartender was super helpful with menu tips and advice.",5
"Salads and Hamachi were great to start.  Penne amatriciana was super flavorful with a kick of spice.  Tommahawk ribeye had incredible flavor and a great char.  Branzino, skirt steak, and veal loin marsala were liked by the group.  Definitely a place to go back to, especially with street parking on sundays no problem.",3
"Great experience.  The food and drinks were great, and service was top notch.",5
Make a reservation.,5
"If I could give our server Roberto 10 stars I would!  Made our anniversary extra special!  Food is great - don’t miss the chicken parm!  Great wine list.  On a packed Saturday night, Roberto made us feel like we were the only ones in the restaurant.  We will definitely be back!",4
"Food was delicious, and importantly the service impeccable . Those guys put so much work into making your evening one worth the memories :) def Reccomend! Ps very good  octopus",5
Food was way too expensive for the average taste. Service felt awkward and not particularly attentive.,5
The food was excellent!  Definitely recommend the Baci dessert for 2!,5
Amazing food!,4
"Food took very long to come out but food was great, waiter was nice and they brought several desserts to make it up to us.",5
Excellent dining.  Staff was gracious and very accommodating,2
1.  Corn Creme Brulee.  2.  Brussels sprouts.  3.  Bone in sirloin.  4.  Warm rolls.  5.  Impeccable service.  6.  Warm atmosphere.  7. Did I mention the Corn Creme Brulee?,4
"Great restaurant for business lunch, anniversaries and milestone celebrations.  Food and service are always top notch.",3
"Superb service,excellent porterhouse- cooked as reequested.",5
"Food was amazing. Very very corporate vibe, everyone there is in a suit and coming for an after work drink.",5
"Hostess took nearly 1 hour to seat us, but made up for it with free appetizers, sides and desserts which was very nice. Would go back for the chicken parm and desserts! The ice creams are amazing and all come in sundae form.",3
"Recently visiting New York, we found ourselves looking for something a little different. And, boy, did we luck out.",5
"Quality Italian is a very different kind of restaurant from its industrial looking interior to its varied menu, it is not your traditional “Italian” restaurant; it is so much more.",5
"It started off wonderfully, after being promptly seated for our 7 o’clock reservation, we were greeted by our server, Michael, an outstanding waiter.",5
"I started off with a house special cocktail, Agrumi Smash – something with vodka in it. Whatever it was, it was delicious!",5
"Next on to the appetizers. I had the Scallop Crudo, fresh thinly sliced raw scallops, fantastic. My partner had Sausage and Pepper with Garlic Toast, another savory delight.",5
"For our entrees, I had the special Dover Sole, a perfectly delectable preparation – lightly sautéed, cooked perfectly. While my partner also had a home run, the Veal Milanese. A veal chop flattened, breaded and fried. I had a taste, it was exquisite. ",5
" Quality Italian lives up to its name, but not just Italian; quality everything!",4
"The restaurant is noisy, cacaphonous and overly bustling with nonsense.  I think people from Out of Town must think this place is cool or something.  The food was average and the service the same.  We could hardly hold a conversation over the poor acoustics playing dated rock tunes and everyone screaming over the crappy tunes.  The only positive is my martini was huge....PHEW!",4
First time,5
"Loved my lunch - had heard about this restaurant for months.  Loved the casual yet very elegant and professional service, and great food.  It was the perfect spot for the meeting I had there.  I was very happy with everything about it.",5
Impeccable service and great and refined food yet simple. The best combination !,5
This is one of the great gastronomic gems of New York and consistently lives up to its own stellar level of experience.,5
Very high quality hand made pastas. Impressive menu with plenty of seafood options that are extremely fresh.,5
stellar in every possible way.  exquisitely delish.,5
Wow what a treat. It was my parents’ first Michelin and finest fine dining experience and they can’t stop talking about how perfect everything was. ,5
"Tami and the rest of the staff, front and back, were great. ",2
Thank you.,5
"Appetizers were tasty but half of them were minuscule and severely overpriced for the portion, the entree were tasteless and homemade pasta so average. The service was condescending, disinterested , never asking how was the food as an example of the lack of concern, even upon paying the bill there was disinterest as to how we liked the meal and experience.",4
"Such a beautiful place ! Great location! Delicious menu ! I had tuna , octopus and sea bass for my enter . Love it !!!",5
Good choice for seafood with reasonably priced selections on the wine list. Missing some of the presentation flair one might at some of the other marquis NYC restaurants.,5
Absolutely fabulous,5
Some of the best food I have ever eaten.,4
Our experience was fantastic. The restaurant was beautiful and the service was beyond exceptional. The food was fabulous. We have dined all over the world and it was definitely in our top favorite restaurants for dining.,5
"the noodle is a little salty, but the lobster is pretty good to try. good service as well",5
La verdad que una excelente opción para comer Frente al Central Park. Costo - benefició más que sobresaliente.,5
Súper recomendable para aquellos que piensen que esto es para unos pocos..,5
Visiting NYC fir a biz conference,5
As always the food and service are outstanding,5
"Marea is a stunning restaurant with truly amazing food and an impressive wine list! The service is some of the best you will experience in the city and  just steps from Central Park. Make a reservation, you’ll be glad you did!",3
"The food was absolutely amazing - pastas delicious as were appetizers.  If you want it to be ""affordable,"" need to watch what you order a bit... but absolutely doable.  Next time would request to be in the main room.  Great drinks - expensive wine though.  Definitely will put it on my special occasion/client dinner list... fab food.",5
"Amazing pasta, and they would do half the portion! Their Tiramisù version is to die for! The new appetizer they recently got on the menu - stuffed cabbage  - is amazingly delicious, all the ingredients go so well together. It’s a place where you want to come for  real food, not the pretentious presentation that so many famous restaurants are notorious for nowadays.",5
"The food was fantastic, living up to expectations, but the service was very disappointing particularly given the restaurant's reputation, to say nothing about the prices.  When we arrived at 5:30 for a pre-show dinner, there was an army of staff lined up near the entry and nearly every table was empty.  For some reason, however, it took over 10 minutes before anyone came to our table to ask if we would like a drink.  Our aloof server would have been adequate for a middle-of-the-road steak house, but her casual approach and inattentiveness was very disappointing for a Michelin star restaurant.  We informed the host when we arrived that we needed to leave for a show by 7:30, but found ourselves searching for the waitress at 7:20 to clear our entree plates and bring the check (we had to pass on the desert included in the prix fixe dinner). Time for Michelin to take another look at Marea.",4
Marea is consistently consistent as one of the top restaurants in NYC.,5
Another superb dinner and service.  We have celebrated here for our special occasions many times and never been disappointed.  This is one of the best in NYC.,5
Fantastic!!,5
Excellent!!,4
Amazing food. One of best restaurants that i have ever been too. Cant wait to come back.,5
Really good!,5
"Fabulous food,  immaculately presented Italian classics in a lovely elegant environment opposite Central Park. Certainly not a cheap night out but well worth it for a special occasion. Seafood amazing! Appetiser prawns, pasta and scallop mains were the highlight and the desserts fantastic. The fixed price 4 course menu is a perfect choice",3
Celebrating a promotion.,1
Always enjoy the vibes and the food at Marea - never had a bad meal.  The ambience is wonderful and the food is sublime - I will go back again and again!,5
"Arrived on time (8:45) - table isnt ready & it happens but it should come with a phony apology & an ETA. Stood around for 15 minutes, decided to ask for our coats so we can have a smoke outside so when inquiring about an ETA - it was met with disdain. This was all fine as I also work in F&B & deeply despise people. I still feel a better effort should be made to conceal such contempt & I try to work on it everyday with my staff. Though it was nice to see Michael White in the house on a Friday night.",5
"We both opted for the 4 course menu & we also decided to add two addt’l crudos, an order of crostini to start & a few langoustines with the main courses. Crudi & antipasti were beautiful. But the fusilli was having a bad day so I didnt touch it - which in turn coincided with the oddest lapse of service I’ve ever witnessed here. The dish sat in front of me for 25 minutes until George our server finally checked in. How many different employees walked by me and said nothing? Alot of runners, servers, sommeliers and guys in suits who check in on tables. No worries, it happens & George made things right. But it left a weird taste in my mouth because of the strange behavior of the host & Maitr’d. ",5
"The take away I always get from Marea is that it’s the type of place where you drop 7 or 8 hundo & you dont feel cheated on food. You just feel the difference between places like this & Le Bernadin. They are in a different stratosphere in terms of service. Marea has no class. You dont have to flag backwaiters for bread, they will serve you whatever glass type you prefer with the champagne & you will never feel like you are doing someone a favor. You will never sit with an untouched dish. You dont care about that stuff at Blue Ribbon - the expectation is set by the restaurant itself. I know diners have a sense of entightlement & that only grows when the spot is bearing two Michelin stars but this doesnt change the little things. The ones that add up and make it all worth while.",4
"What a disappointment.  We were sat down next to a piece of furniture that housed silverware.  The entire night the wait staff were opening and closing the draw and all we heard was the continual clanking of silverware.  The final straw came when the wait staff brought over a huge tray of silverware to put in the draw.  To top it off, there was an extremely bright lamp sitting on top which totally destroyed the mood.  The wait staff would linger and chat while they got the silverware for their tables. Ironically, we had to ask for silverware for our table.  When we complained to the general manager he was rude and had an attitude. First he acknowledged it wasn't a good table and we should have asked to move.  Really!!!!  When addressed again, he actually stated that people request our table.  (hehehe)  General Manager left such a bad taste that we will never return.  Great food, very poorly managed!!!!!!!!!!!!",5
Always perfect every visit — love the team here.,2
Loved everything about Marea. Had s great server named Elizabeth. Bonus was having Bono and the Edge sitting next to us!,4
The fusilli was excellent and The plate whith burrata was very very good!!!,3
Waiter was extremely helpful. Wine special was a great deal.,4
"We dined at this restaurant on a Thursday night and the place was jumping.  The tables are very close together & the noise level was so high that it was difficult to talk across the table. The lighting is very dim, making it hard to read the menu.  When we complained, the waiter brought us a candle which should be standard issue. The ambiance was not the best, but the food was wonderful.  I had the crab and avocado appetizer which was beautifully presented and delicious. For the money, there could have been a little more crabmeat, but that is being picky.   My entree was the triple filet which was filet mignon prepared 3 ways.  It was so soft, even well done, that I cut it with a fork.  For dessert, the chocolate/banana parfait was fine.",3
"We were a little disappointed with our dining experience - we were there to celebrate my husband's birthday and it was sooooooooooo loud we couldn't maintain a conversation and barely could communicate with our waiter. Food was good, but felt that the wine list was a bit overpriced.",3
I dine out a lot and I loved loved quality meats and i dont even eat meat!  the menu is great with something for everyone.  the side dishes were so delicious and flavorful.  i will definitely return.  It's got a great vibe and the decor is so different and interesting.  loved the bathrooms!,5
Excellent for smaller business dinner.,4
"My 4th time back in the past few months. Great food. Really like the build out -interesting to look at. We were seated in the area that was a private room , all the way upstairs and to the right. It was fine until 2 large tables were seated. Then it became a shouting match between those tables. I will request that I not be seated there again. By the end of dinner, I had had enough. I will come back but wont be seated up there.",4
"The food was quite good, the ambience and decor lovely and the service was impeccable.",5
Our first visit was much more enjoyable.  We were disappointed in the steak and the potatoes were over priced for the quality.,4
we were a large group of 16 and they did a great job taking care of our table.,4
"Great food and wonderful wine list. The small confined space does not allow for quite conversation. The patrons were loud and festive. Not a site for a business meeting, but rather a fun and spirited social gathering with a group of friends.",4
"Good for biz lunches, that's it.",3
We were very impressed with the food and ambience at Quality Meats.  The space is rather unique and they have capitalized on it to make many nooks and crannies with well-spaced tables.  There are private party spaces which are also very attractive.  Both the food and service were excellent.  We would highly recommend and will definitely revisit ourselves.,4
"This steakhouse is near the top of the list. The appetizers and entrees were outstanding (try the three filets, each prepared differently and deliciously). Sides of corn creme brulee and pan fried potatoes were phenomenal. Ditto for the wine list. Only a couple of minor annoyances- the butter for the bread was hard and the bread, being a fresh baked loaf in its own pan, came out very hot. I did not realize this nor did the waiter alert us, and I burned my finger. Otherwise the meal was very enjoyable and not exorbitantly priced (for a steakhouse). Unfortunately we couldn't have dessert, the meal was so good and filling we had no room left!! We will definitely be back though.",4
best bone-in NY strip I've ever tasted,5
"Food was excellent, and while the downstairs seating area seemed appropriate to this level of dining, the upstairs seemed slightly less formal- perhaps because of the sheer size and lack of intimacy?  Service was attentive, but we felt a bit rushed after we were ~75% of the way through each course.  Better to leave some plates until we are really done than to ask as you are removing the plate.  Very good value, and I will recommend to others.",4
"major issues with heat, it was FREEZING in the restaurant Saturday evening. it really made having a nice dinner impossible when you have to eat with your coat on.",2
"I have been to many of New York's finer steakhouses, but Quality Meats is by far the best I've been to.  The seafood bouquet was exquisite and the beef was beyond compare.  There is no doubt in my mind that I will not find a better steak in New York.",5
"We went early, about 5PM. Service was great. Everyone was incredibly nice. The tomato/mozz salad was very tasty and we shared it. The Quality Potato was my personal favorite since I love mashed potatos and this was mashed on growth hormones. The rib steak was a bit disappointing, not hot, a bit past medium rare and not as awe-inspiring as I would've expected. My wife's filet mignon was excellent though, she said. The best was when we said we had no room for dessert but the host gave us butterscotch ice cream with oatmeal cookies. AMAZING!! So it was all good and some great.",4
I felt my bone in sirloin was marginal as did sveral of the other six guests.,3
Perfect restaurant on all counts!  One of our favourites that we keep returning to now.,5
Service attentive and good quality meats exactly as the name of the restaurant.,4
We would reccomend it to all kind of people.,5
Excellent beef and great side dishes. Best meal since Le Bernardin!,4
Will definitely go back.,3
The waiter was excellent and kind enoug to give us sorbet for dessert on the house.,4
"Great attntion, great wine variety, a little expensive, but worth it if you are in th mood for something to remember.",4
Our service was exceptional as was our waiter. I don't remember his name but he was fantastic!,4
A great steak house...they do it RIGHT,5
We have had four or five meals and all have outstanding,3
I have eaten at Quality Meats on several occasions and have constantly found the food to be superlative. The service has always been cordial and personal without being intrusive...the staff really provides a delightful experience.,3
High expectations but the meat was very mediocre! Not seasoned much and I definitely would not come back.,5
"Great decor and great service.  Steak was only OK, sides were great and the wine mark-up was very high  2-3x",5
"Everything was wonderful.  Our reservation was right on time.  Each member of the staff attentive.  The food was wonderful and our wait staff superb.  Our waiters Stefano and Julia were incredible. They knew when to help and when to be unobtrusive. They cheerfully explained the menu which included the specials that were displayed with prices as well. That was nice, no suprises.  The decoration was unique and fun to look at.  An overall outstanding experience.",2
I brought clients for Wine Week and had a great experience.  The food and service were outstanding.,4
"Quite convenient to Carneghie Hall where we had a concert later in the evening. Inedible calamari -- very gummy; sliced sirloin ""touted as the best steak"" by the waitor was tender but had no intrinsic taste -- in desperate need of salt and their own sauce.  Veal chop was very good and needed nothing to enhance flavor.  For us, the quality of meat couldn't hold a candle to either Del Frisco's or one of the BLT's; service was excellent and we were comped a dessert because of our complaints re the calamari.  Do not intend to return.",5
One of the better steak houses in the city.... The meal was excellent.......,5
"Hands down, one of my favorite restaurants in NY.  If only it wasn't so loud....but other than that, love everything about Quality Meats and can't wait to eat there again soon.",3
Love the beer and the mussels!!!!!!!!!!!  Moules to the true lovers.  And the fries are real ones!!!!,3
"A good if not great steakhouse, since New York is SO competitive when it comes to steakhouses, we like to try the notable ones but eventually return only to the ones we REALLY love.  This, again, is a fine choice BUT it's not in my personal top tier (which is topped by The Strip House in my book). Having said that, I don't think you'd be disappointed either if you keep your expectations to a MODERATE level.",4
"Had a terrific lunch here more recently, stopped by after shopping with no reservation - no worries. The GM is a gem and the food delicious.",3
Great steakhouse with traditional/country club kind of feel.  May feel a tad stuffy for younger diners or people who enjoy New York's trendier restaurants.,5
"Although, the crowd was lite service was poor. Steaks were tough & returned. Sides came out after the steaks.",2
Waiters try and upsell you on everything. Waiter recommended a so-called special side dish which cost over $60 and never mentioned price. Charged $2 for blue cheese olives in drink,1
"Excellent food, great music and professional staff - we really enjoyed it. Strawberry cobbler cocktail was a highlight as were the remixes of the retro music.",4
I loved STK i just found it a little to loud as my date and i was helling at eachother over a 2 person table. but otherwise it was great. i did love the music they played. the food was great and our server was fab.,4
"Dinner was good & it could be totally up to par with Del Frisco's or Wolfgang's, etc. except for a few things. I know they are trying to be trendier than your avg. steakhouse but the music was so loud that I felt like I was in a club not fun screaming across the table. The bread w/blue cheese butter & chive dip was fantastic, tuna tartare amazing, iceberg blue cheese salad was fair & skimpy on the tomatoes. Steak was very good & STK bold sauce was great but the steak didn't come out steaming hot like it would at a legit steakhouse - it was lukewarm. Your plate is supposed to be so hot that they tell you not to touch it at a real steakhouse. Don't get the creamed spinach - spinach leaves w/cream poured on it. Mac & cheese awesome.",4
"Steak house turns into meat market after 10pm! Really cool ambiance, great food, excellent service. Husband and I stayed in lounge area after dinner and we were amused by the 30-something crowd on the prowl. The was a DJ wedged into the corner that played 80's music during dinner, then more current stuff after 10pm. I thought the music during the dinner hours odd....Don't let the late night scene turn you off...REALLY great steaks!",4
"It's a large, hip, club-like space with quite good good and friendly servers. A plus: steaks are available in small, medium and large, which is good for small appetites.",4
"Went for an early dinner post matinee with out of town guests/teen girls. Food delicious service very attentive. Loved the truffle fries and shrimp krispies, and of course the steak was excellent. Shared one large serving for four with appetizers. Turned into a scene as we were leaving -- be back for an adult evening.",5
unusual place for meeting firends,5
food good especially apple crumble,3
"For a restaurant called STK, the steaks are not as good as they should be, nor are they well-cooked. My bone-in filet was meally and tasteless, and unevenly done - ""medium rare"" doesn't mean that one end of the steak is medium and the other is rare. And the quality of the cuts doesnt match the prices - or the staff's attitudes. Our waitress would not allow us to order a shared appetizer while we made the rest of our selections - she said it was the chef's ""policy"" that orders be placed all at once. Seems like a policy designed to turn covers as fast as possible.",5
Our policy is that we won't be going back.,4
"Great place for food, dancing and people watching in Midtown....will return for sure.",4
"I was concerned that his place was more for the scene than the food, but was proven wrong. While the food was very pricey, it was also delicious. We shared the porterhouse steak, which was over 30 ounces of deliciousness, so plenty for two which also cut down on the price. The wine list is ridiculously priced though. While the one we chose was the cheapest on the menu at $100, it was excellent. I just don't think there I any need too have the majority of the wine at an average price of about $400. The clientele didn't seem to be in that class. Food tip; truffle fries are not a frite...they are thick cut, somewhat drier, and while tasty, if you want typical French fries get frites. The Brussels sprouts side dish are fantastic.",4
"We loved STK. The decor was beautiful and the music was a ""vibrant touch."" The food was delicious. When making a wine selection, be sure to ask how much. We made the mistake by not asking...we ordered two 1/2 bottles of a Shiraz from France, not aware they were $98.00 each!!!",4
The place was great except that the music is too loud to talk. Food and service is excellent.,4
"We had a great time at STK! My only complaint would be the steak size. Filet only come in 10 oz. which is not big enough. The Porterhouse should not be that expensive given it's size. I don't think they season their steak though. I had to add a lot of salt and the STK steakhouse is, eh, so so. A little too sweet for my liking.",2
"Other then that, the place is delicious!",4
Little pricey but amazing food!,3
sorry...I was very excited about going and I was a bit dissapointed. It was over rated and way over priced.,4
"Great atmosphere, delicious food! Service could be a little more friendly.",5
"this was our first time at the STK. we really didn't know what to expect. the food was just ok, nothing to rave about. however, the noise level was much louder than we would have liked. Club level music made it difficult to hold a conversation with my wife who was sitting across from me. in addition, the tables were just a lil' to close together. spending 4 bills on a dinner for two is not a problem for me, however table proximity and club level volume music made this a place that i would probably not return too.",3
Enjoyed my dinner there very much.,4
Midtown is the new Downtown. I Love the design & the energy. Great for groups. Cant go wrong with this ONE.,4
"This place has such a good vibe with the fun music, decor and overall atmosphere. Unfortunately the steaks don't hold up to the name of the restaurant. I ordered the skirt steak, 2 people ordered the ribeye and 1 one ordered the short ribs. The ribeye and skirt steaks were extremely bland and too charred on the outside. We all ordered them medium rare and they were cooked properly, but I don't think any seasonings were used to prepare the steaks and all we tasted was a burnt taste because of the excessive charring. The short ribs had good flavor, but the meat was on the dry side. We did enjoy our sides, however. All of us at the table said if we were to go back, we would order the fish.",5
"Went to 'STK"" on Saturday February 4th with another couple. We had their shrimp bisgue, pear and endive salad and shrimp cockatail for appetizer. All very fresh and delicious. For dinner a couple of us had the lamb chops, sea bass and short ribs. All the main dishes as well were all very good. Sides were creamed spinach. Nice atmosphere and a nice place to grab a very good meal if you are in the theater district area not to far from broadway shows. We would definelty go back. I actually enjoyed the fact that not only was the food very good - but there was none of that pretentious trying to make the plate look good foamy vertical stuff going on. I love a restuarant that prepares good food and serves it the way it should be served.",3
"Steaks were good, but didn't get mine cooked the way I wanted so had to send it back and was still so-so! Otherwise great. Be sure not to miss the chocolate peanut butter dessert, ""birthday cake"" also a great choice!",4
"When outstanding food and profesional service meet together, you can't ask for more.",5
I came to NYC from long away (Israel) and offered by a friend to try it.,3
"My summary will be: STK is One of the best meat restaurant I ever had! ...and I had, a lot..",3
I thought the food was very good. Both fish and meat dishes were cooked to perfection and flavorfull. All of the sides were delicious as well. Place is a bit pricey but nothing out of the ordinary for a steak house. One big drawback is the noise level. There were six of us at the table and it was impossible for those at the one of the table to hear what those at the other end said. There's a big bar scene but not much separation in the noise levels between the bar and restaurant area - I wouldn't go back for this reason unless it could be a quieter experience. For the price I'd like to hear my friends and be heard.,5
High energy and great decor at this midtown spot. We asked the waiter for recommendations and she steared us towards the crowd pleasers (acknowledging that there were certain items to stay away from). Great DJ and atmosphere. We would definitely go back again.,2
"We were substantially delayed in arrival; none-the-less, we were graciously received and service was excellent. We thoroughly enjoyed our 1st experience at STK - Midtown and will highly recommend it to others.",4
"It's a really nice place to go have a couple of drinks , food is excellent the only problem is that the music is to laud and can't have conversations while dinning",4
"The decor was trendy and fun. The food wasn't as good as the meat packing location. I really made the reservation because of a tv segment on their truffles. Well, the truffles had no aroma or flavor and that is very bad to me! I was disappointed with that and another person ordered short ribs and they were dry and hard to swallow. But if you want the bar scene with a trendy atmosphere go there. Also the dj was confusing. One minute it was 80s then to 70s then to beastie boys. It seemed to be his first dj gig, but wrong place to start. Overall, decor decor decor saved the night.",3
"You MUST go to STK! Great food, great service / ambiance, and one of the best dining experiences I've had in Manhattan!",5
"Excessive amount of up selling. Up selling the Wine, the app, the main course, the sides. Way to work on adding $200 to a bill. Food was ok, but not worth it.",5
Most importantly the steaks were done very well and tasty as well as the sides. I had the sirloin with lobster mac/cheese and asparagus. The waiter was nice but the coordination between all the servers could have been better - probably just needs some time as it just opened.,5
Christmas Lunch,5
"Great meal, great service. Can always count on a professional experience.",5
"High quality meats, the chef not so careful at the cook (I asked my dry aged rib to be rare and they brought it medium rare to medium, interesting drinks list, but the bartenders are very arrogant.",4
Service was amazing. The waiter even brought us the creme brûlée corn complimentary because I kept going back and forth about ordering it and surprised me with It. Will definitely be back.,5
Have been here many times it’s our standard go to place. Tonight it was disappointing. Meat was very salty and my wife’s medium was only half medium the other half was well done. Waiter was nice but they were not as friendly and welcoming as in the past. Will think twice before trying again.,2
The food itself was troubling. I had gotten a rib eye which was good on along the outside but the inside didn’t not taste as good. My friends all got steak for two and it tasted too dry on the outside and too raw on the inside. Was very poorly cooked. We were also sat in the back when we’ve made early reservation and most other parts of the restaurant was empty. The ambience was very poor in the back as the light contrast was not that good on the eye. Would probably not come back.,2
"Hostess was awful, party of 8 with 2 tables and expected to have half of the party seat first and then when available then seat the other half of the party. Another front employee was able to seat us at the same time and even found to tables next to each other.",3
"This was our second time visiting Quality Meats and I think it may have been even better than the first time. The front staff was so accommodating, the ambiance was lively and fun, and the food was superb. Everyone in our party can once again say that “this is the best steak you’ll ever have!” Thanks again for a wonderful experience. We can’t wait to return!",5
Birthday.   Wonderful,5
"Good food, it was very crowded. During the holiday season. Bread delicious. My group was very happy with their meat but I wish they had one dish that was vegetarian.",4
Would never have tried the bacon and peanut butter appetizer but our server recommended it and I can’t stop thinking about it. So unique and delicious. Also loved the gnocchi and cheese and creamed spinach. The steaks were “quality meat”. Expect to spend some money but it’s absolutely worth it.,5
"Unfortunately, service wasn’t the best as we had come to expect. Instead of comp’ing a dessert, I would have rather had an engaging and exceptional waiter/server that we saw more than twice and not have waited 50 minutes for our entree (it was even longer because we started counting after we received our appetizers and not 50 minutes after ordering). Ultimately, this place still has our loyalty  because we loooooove the food (You cannot find corn creme brûlée any where else in the world) and we recognize it was a Saturday evening before the holidays. We just wish this anniversary had a better experience.",4
"Overall, the food was great however the service was subpar for a NYC restaurant given the numerous options there are for a good steak. Food took over an hour to arrive at the table even though dining at 5:00pm.",4
"This is very much a corporate midtown dining restaurant, having said that, for the food the value tallies in across the board for the price-point (high end) for midtown, the wine list is decidedly overpriced...what do you do? If you want to dine in this area at this type of restaurant, I have eaten here several times i just wish the wine list was more accommodating!",3
"Always an excellent evening out, best steak in New York! Always a little noisy however...",5
Always a special occasion.,5
"From the time we arrived and were seated, we were treated like royalty. It started with a complementary bottle of fine Italian champagne to celebrate my wife’s birthday. The food entre’s were prepared exquisitely and served magnificently.  While the food was served in a timely manner, but we never felt rushed in any way.  Couldn’t have asked for more delightful evening.",5
"Went for my birthday, loved the fod and ambiance ! the spinach , porterhouse steak, and ghonni and cheese was beyond good. They gave me a lemon meringue pie to celebrate which was also good! And even my cocktail was good. Service great! This is definitely a date spot, girls night, birthday and even business friendly establishment. If it is on your to do list please go!",4
Ottimo ma molto rumoroso,5
I went here for my birthday and absolutely loved it. Food was delicious and the service immaculate. Will return again soon.,5
"Great atmosphere and wine, the chocolate cake dessert was the highlight of my experience",5
"This was our first visit to Quality Meats.  The meal was delicious, the service was excellent.  Highly recommend!",3
"Just another steakhouse. Staff was apologetic about the excessive wait to seat us and delivered excellent service, but ultimately could not make up for the lackluster cuisine.",2
"Both filets we ordered were tough and overcooked. We returned them to the kitchen. When we asked the waiter why they were still on the bill, he said he would tell his manager. The manager came to the table, apologized but would only take one filet off the bill. For a restaurant that calls itself “Quality Meats,”they should stand by their brand promise.",3
"Too much delay in taking table. 75 minutes.We booked a table at 20,30......we get the table at 21,45",1
"Highly overrated!  Filet was not particularly tender. Halibut was small and served on cold potatoes in a bowl shaped dish that did not allow for placing asparagus on the plate. Asparagus was old n not particularly tender. Service was nonexistent. Server couldn’t even wait to take the complete order and had to be called back to the table, never asked how our meal was, had to be reminded to bring the asparagus, never refilled water glasses, and generally didn’t seem to care if we lived or died. Only the coat check girl showed interest in our experience and referred us to the manager who was apologetic and wanted to give us some credit for next time but there will be no next time.",5
"We were planning a trip to NY over my husband's birthday so I did a quick search for steak places in Midtown, and this one came up. He's a big fan of Pat LaFrieda (if you can be a fan of a butcher?) so I knew this was the place. We met some friends and had a table for four within a few minutes of our reserved time. Was glad we booked early because it was packed! It has a lively atmosphere, a bit loud as other reviewers suggested. But the steak was delicious, as were the sides. Furnishings and decor are amazing; the place is quite a bit larger than it looks when you enter. The staff was very friendly and helpful across the board. Would definitely go back!",5
The food and service are outstanding but this is a popular place so the wait times and noise can be high.,5
"Amazing just like last time. Perfect for out of town-ers, great pre-theater spot.",5
The meal was great and the chocolate cake was to die for. The options for sides on the lunch menu was limited and we were looking for potatoes either hash or mash and the fries were underwhelming. The appetizers had two crab dishes perhaps a tuna poke or bacon slab would have been nice to have a variety.,5
"This place NEVER disappoints. We visit every time we are win the city for the Holidays. Service, cocktails and meals are always off the hook! Do yourself a favor and go!",3
"I would not consider this restaurant as being 5 stars! More like 3.5! Service  average.  We ordered  porterhouse steak for 2 .  Good quality ,cooked right however steak was not hot.",4
Great!,5
"Lovely  dinner with friends . Our second visit to this restaurant and were very much looking forward to returning , however, this time my filet mignon lacked taste and for the first time I had to ask for a salt shaker. My husband had the aged rib eye and had the same comment. The steaks were just barely warm.  Otherwise, we had a good time with our friends. Staff very friendly and attentive.",5
"My husband and I ate here after seeing a show on Broadway for our anniversary.  We loved the atmosphere, cozy and clean. The food was AMAZING (I highly recommend trying the scallops appetizer)",4
"Meat good, maybe ever so slightly under seasoned. Steak sauce great, corn creme brulee side dish was bonkers. Service fantastic. Good vibes. Worth the price.",4
"Food and drinks were great, our waitress was a ""ghost"", no where to be found until we needed the check and that was a mess of it's own. ",3
2 issues:,5
"1st issue - We ordered the dry aged for two at medium plus, one side was cooked well and melted in your mouth, the other side was hard to chew and almost to the point of not a good cut of meat. Too bad we couldn't tell anyone since the before-mentioned waitress was nowhere to be found. ",5
"2nd issue - I had a $150 gift card to use before final processing, somehow they ran the gift card, but still charged my card for the full $350+ bill and never accounted for the gift card. Waitress was not ""all there"" and her explanation was BS. ",5
"Probably won't go back to this place, a shame because the food was overall good.",5
As a pre-theater dinner experience we were delighted!,4
Very attentive wait staff. Couldn't have asked for a better evening!,5
"Like Arnold, ""we'll be back""!",5
"Good food, but a bit too pricey. Steak was great, nothing special about the skillet potatoes and onions or the creme brulee. On main floor of restaurant it's hustle and bustle but in the back room it is quiet and extremely dark. Good for privacy.",5
"I have eaten in this local restaurant a few times, the food and wine is excellent.",3
"Great location, Great Food, Great Service, and Great Management. A wonderful dining experience. Many thanks to Chris (Manager), James (Asst. Manager), Andrea and Chris (Servers)",2
You need to request to see the price fix theatre dinner menu. It was excellent value. Waiters were very attentive. This was my second visit and plan on making a third visit within the next three months.,5
Pricy but service is excellent. Ordered ribeye pink and it was over done which is surprising since this is a steak house.,1
just to say that the steaks are not as good as they should be regarding the price!!!,4
Had the filet. It was unbelievably tender. The potatoes au gratin are to die for. Fantastic restaurant. Would definitely go back.,5
In a word...TERRIBLE.,5
Got called for my table at 1045. I was already seated at a high top.,5
Girl who checked me in was rude and didn't care,5
always a great spot. service very good. restaurant very busy but we were seated immediately,5
"Great food, ambience and service. Server was extremely knowlegable and honest regarding everything from wines to apps to entrees. Bone in rib eye was as tender as a filet and very flavorful. Excellent experience.",5
Very impressed with this steakhouse! Amazing food and amazing service!,5
"We go here often, it is our favorite steak house",5
Food and service were excellent!,5
"This restaurant is awesome. It is as good as advertised. I first heard about Del Frisco's while reading an upscale lifestyle magazine a few years back. I finally got a chance to go, and it was well worth the wait.",5
"The wait staff was outstanding, the food was perfect and we had a blast. The place wa packed and we were treated like the only people there.",5
"Quite honestly the best steak I've ever eaten. Wine list and dessert menus were amazing. It was a great date night with friends. Wait staff is very knowledgeable and courteous. Somelier was very busy, and didn't arrive in time for us to select a bottle of wine. That said, there is a great list of suggestions in the front of the wine menu.",4
"Del Frisco's has the best steak in New York, quite possibly in the country. I don't think that I've had better steak and I've been to Luger's, Sparks, Mark Joseph's, Metropolitan Grill (Seattle), Morton's, Smith & Wollensky's, Gibson's (Chicago), Chicago Chop House, Lawry's, Daniel's Broiler, etc.",4
"A wonderful dining experience, great food, excellent service and a view looking out at 6th Avenue and Radio City Music Hall. It’s a steakhouse and they cook steak to perfection. Ask for a table on the second floor if you can for a great view.",5
"ALWAYS MY BEST MEAL IN NEW YORK CITY! PERFECT LOCATION, PERFECT SERVICE",5
AND ALWAYS A GREAT ATMOSPHERE THAT REFLECTS A GREAT CITY!,5
"We had 7:00 reservations,very loud, uncomfortably so.It did quiet down later.We sat downstairs. No corkage, we ask the manager to reconsider,because we brought a special bottle with us, but no.  They tried to make it up to us, with a free dessert.  Overall, very good ! We especially like the 3 smaller filets with different sauces.Service was excellent.",5
"Perfect place for a great steak before a show. Four of us dined there before the Peter Gabriel concert at Radio City. I booked via open table, was seated promptly and the waitstaff took very good care of us. When we told them we were on a timeline, they responded perfectly and had us on our way right on time. The steak we ordered, Filet Mignon and Porterhouse received rave reviews as did the salmon one person ordered. All the sides were good, but the creamed spinach was the best. Del Frisco's is my favorite steak place in NY. While it can be expensive its well worth it.",5
"'ve eaten some good steak and this place served me one of the best bone-in-ribeyes I have ever eaten. Service was excellent and the ""chateau potatoes"" were very tasty (spicy mashed potatoes). We went early to catch a Broadway show and sat downstairs which seemed a bit cavernous. Might be better later at night when it is dark and you can see out the huge windows. By the time we left at 1815 the bar area was packed and the dining room was just starting to get busy.",5
It was really good. The food was delicious.,4
I've been here several times and the food is always excellent and the waitresses are always beautiful!,2
"Making a reservation at 6:15, and arrived 5 minuets before it. But we had to wait for more than 50 minuets  until we got a table. No apologies were given to us or to the crowd who were waiting for a long time. Some people had to leave. ",3
This is my favorite Manhattan steakhouse.,1
"Had a excellent meal, fun atmosphere. Service was great - our server Jenn did a wonderful job. Good wine advice from the sommelier. Would recommend this restaurant for business dinners or a special occasion.",5
WONDERFUL DINING EXPERIENCE! LOVED IT! WILL DEFINITELY RETURN!,5
"The best filet I've ever eaten. The waitress, Amber, was friendly, made great suggestions (especially the to die for signature cocktail), and was extremely professional. I can't wait to go back.",4
"Overall, Del Frisco's is a great steakhouse. I love the Midtown location, really convenient to the Theatre District and shopping, My only issue, which is not unique to Del Frisco's, is the lack of creativity in appetizers and sides. Steakhouses focus on their meat entrees, and while the appetizers and sides are good; they are just not innovative or unique. A great place to grab s bite when in Midtown. Remember to ask to be seated upstairs, the view is best from there.",2
"We usually go to Keen's for great steak but wanted to try something new. DelFrisco's is a chain restaurant, and it came across that way. We went for dinner and people were dressed in sweatpants and kids were playing portable nintendo at a table. 10 oz filet mignon was ok, but definitely have had better. It was very noisey and the tables were crammed together on the upper level seating area. Not as expensive as Keen's, but left feeling a bit confused about why people rave about the place. Would not go again because it really does not have the ambiance or the food I was expecting from a steakhouse.",4
"Food was mediocre, not cooked as ordered. Non-stop upselling to get you to order the most expensive items on the menu and constant over-praising of the mediocre food made the whole evening one we wished we had skipped. Only highlight was the onion rings.",5
"We took my daughter here for her 14th birthday. We all enjoyed our meals immensely. The waiter was great. We all ordered some sort of steak and they were all cooked to perfection. I would rate this as our favorite steak house. We are pleased that they have opened one up in Boston, a lot closer to home and may go for a special occasion as it is very pricey.",3
Someone who is supposed to be the manager was so rude.,5
Great experience overall.,5
"Amazing. Our waiter Peter treated us like family, great service!!! Definitely recommend:)",3
I don’t think I will be back,5
"Il posto è meraviglioso, molto newyorkese. Cibo buono ed accoglienza magnifica. La carne ottima ed anche il pesce merita. Consigliato.",5
This was a wonderful dinner from the start. The staff were great and helpful but the food was the best. Would go back in a heartbeat. Well done Del Frisco New York,5
"Our meal and dining experience at Del Frisco’s was like all the others- excellent! The food, the service and the atmosphere were all top notch and first class!",3
"I was happy with the quality of the food and the ambience. However, I have to point out that the transition between appetizers to mains was extremely long, over 40 minutes. Additionaly, we were taken by surprise when the Veuve Cliquot  poured (taster) had no bubbles. The server response was one that is talking to people he thinks had never had veuve cliquot. Saying to us Veuve cliquot has small bubbles. We decided to let him pour it, and we noticed that in all other glasses there were bubbles, except for the one. Obviously, the glass was dirty or something was off about it resulting in no bubbles. I expect that at a high end restaurant as this, glasses will be clean and the waiter would be knowdgeable to know that if no bubbles are present something is off and not to undersetimate its customers. Wonder if the fact that I had to translate for my family was a factor.",5
"Dinner before a show. We were seated immediately, no wait. Been to several restaurants and had to wait even with reservations. ",5
Food was delicious and the wine even better. We didn't leave ourselves time for dessert but were told to come back after the show and it would be on them... Unfortunately we didn't make it back.,5
Kenny our server was the best and also had a visit from the manager to our table... Very nice!!,5
We'll definitely be back again,5
"The food was excellent, of course. It is every time we're there. Our server was Brad. He is a delightful young man and an excellent waiter. We got an education about cuts of meat from him and were not aware of the bone in meat giving the beef more flavor, for example. We were able to sit where we wanted to this time. We didn't have that when we were there in June. We came for the food and our waiter was great, but where we sit has a little to do with our enjoyment of your restaurant. We look forward to special occasions at your restaurant. The food is very rich and also expensive. That's why we come for birthdays and our anniversary. Wish we could come for often, but it is what it is. :-)",5
Remarkable service! Food was outstanding and cooked to perfection. It was our first time visiting NYC and del Frisco’s and would absolutely return and recommend to all our friends in the area. ,5
Thank you so much for the enjoyable experience.,4
"The food and the service were impeccable.  We celebrated my husband’s birthday, and they brought a special dessert to our table which was outstanding.  If you are looking for a delicious steak dinner with great ambiance, I highly recommend this location. We will visit again when in NYC.",5
Vwramente ottimo il cibo e il locale è spkendido.,4
Da ritornare!,5
Exceptional service by Robert and great food. Very happy overall,5
家族4人で行きました。,5
おススメの、ポーターハウスステーキとフィレステーキ、そしてアスパラガスを焼いたのを食べましたがどれもとても美味しかったです。,4
ポーターハウスはとても大きく2人でシェアで丁度いいかと思いました。,5
店員さんもとても雰囲気がよく、価格もリーズナブルだと思いました。,5
また利用したいお店です。,5
"we spent the night of the end of the year, we had a very nice moment in a festive atmosphere and we had an unforgettable dinner",5
Excelente servicio!!,3
Excellent restaurant. Delicious food. Very good ambience and cgreat menu,5
"Went here for NYE with a group of 14. Everything was perfect organized, the atmosphere was great and the food was delicious! All served at the same time, which is important when you’re with a big group!",2
Del Frisco alway the best steakhouse in NYC.,4
The team of managers and servers best in the city.,5
Peter and Kristen are wonderful and know the best steaks and all the best wines.,5
The best view of all the restaurants in NYC.,5
Always a 10 for 10,5
Neil H,5
Everyone was kind and accommodating! Food was so delish! I highly recommend DelFriscos. :),5
The crab cake appetizer was very good! A must order item.,5
Staff is the best! Always so kind and nice! Love them all,4
"Great restaurant, food was amazing and the service was even better - Christian (Chris) was our server and he was fantastic. Made the experience unforgettable, knew the menu like the back of his hand and had fantastic recommendations.",5
Great steakhouse with fantastic service,5
"everything we ate was amazing! flambe lobster fra diavolo was delicious, but I wish i knew beforehand it was going to be quite a show! corn creme brulee was one of the best things i've eaten in a while. the coffee crumb bun was good, but not anything super amazing.",4
"one pet peeve... we had asked the waitress what were some of the more popular dishes, and she didn't even mention the chicken parm that showed up on almost every other table. i had also read about it all over the internet, and it seems to be the buzz of the town. not that we were testing her, but had we been, she would not have passed.",2
- about five host/hostess waiting up front. all rude. all of their cell phones. not a great first impression for a brand new restaurant.,2
"- was first seated at a table that was SO close to the table next to us, we might as well have been on a double date. in fairness, they moved us but were not happy about it.",4
"- our waiter and his assistant were great, friendly and knowledgeable",4
- pasta dishes were both lackluster (at best),4
- meat was well prepared,5
and the cherry on top? got a birthday dessert for my date. they brought their signature ice cream with a candle. but didn't even bother to light the candle.,2
"We had an early reservation and I wanted to order a glass of red wine and, asked for a recommendation. She, I think misunderstood, and offered a bottle at $150.00. I then asked for a glass and she recommended the most expensive on the list. I ordered a glass in the mid price range.",4
"I asked about their most popular main course and again it was the most expensive. I was getting the picture she was most concerned with her tip, not our satisfaction. We ordered two appetizers which were ordinary and then ordered their chicken parmesan. It came to the table formed into a pizza shape and was enough for four. It was absolutely tasteless. In addition to ordinary food, we were given the bums rush. She managed to get us out in 45 minutes..",5
"Just as good as Quality Meats but with an Italian Kick. Suasage and Peppers app was great. We had a salad with steak that was pretty god (QM has a better selection), lobster roll (which was very good) and a burger which was excellent. Prices were moderate. This is a newer restaurant made from an old Staples store, the re-modeling is beautiful and open. No expense spared.",5
Very nice and knowledgable wait staff.,4
"Food and service were very good. However, the place is incredibly noisy Definitely not a place to go if you want to have a nice meal talking to your fellow diners. Would be fun for a group.",3
"From beginning to end this restaurant was amazing...the bone marrow is an absolute must and the corn brulee is delish! Great atmosphere and they had wine specials for bottles not just glasses, which was a great surprise as one of our favorite wines was at a discounted price! Hope to go back soon!",5
"Only one complaint, the restaurant never let open table know we were there and I never received my 1000 points, which was one of the reasons I had gone in the first place.",5
"Great new spot,",5
"food was excellent. The Veal and Posta was the best, Try the sauge on Garlic toast WOW",4
The food is fantastic (must have the chicken parm) but the service was very disappointing. For a restaurant of this caliber to have service that bad is unacceptable. Our waiter was sloppy and not attentive. Our group of 4 was crowded next to a large group of about 20 people.,2
"I am a big fan of Quality Meats, so wanted to try QI. It has all the best feature of QM plus a real Italian aspect that was great. Will easily become a favorite.",4
Loved this place. One of my favorite in all of NYC. You won't go wrong coming here.,5
"Wonderful!Great concept.Better then Quality Meats(and we love Quality Meats).Inventive food The chiken parm is the best I have ever eaten.All the steaks that went by looked out of this world. Gnudi selections were just wonderful.This will be an incredibly popular restaurant ,between the foodies of NYC,the tourists,and all the businesses in the area.Just great!",4
"The place was very lively. We are from New Orleans and my wife and I were both reminded of Emeril's original restaurant. We had a nice bottle of Pinot Grigio that was the sommelier's recommendation and affordable. The best menu item was the Creme Brûlée Corn. What a fantastic side, better than our dessert. Our waiter was very helpful and friendly. The menu is not overwhelming but a good explanation from the waiter should be obtained. For apps, we had the lobster and eggplant balls. Both were delicious. The lobster came with sauces instead of hot butter. Different, but I think I would have preferred just butter. For entrees we had a filet and thin breaded veal that was called a chop. All in all, a great experience.",5
"We finally had dinner at Quality Itlian on Saturday night after a long wait while we watched it under construction. Being fans of Quality Meats we were anxious to see how they would do with an Italian menu. Unfortunately, about the only thing Italian about this place is the word in the name and some seasoning sprinkled on the bread. To our disappointment, it's basically the same restaurant as Quality Meats. Not that it's a bad thing as we love the food and service there. We were just hoping for a spin-off of the brand that we could enjoy in addition to Meats.",3
Fantastic food! Inventive and Delicious. The two usually don't go together.but in this case yummmmmmmm!,3
This was a great experience... the quality of the food ordered was espectacular... will definitely go back to this place.,5
"My wife and I went on a Thursday evening at 630pm, the downstairs bar opened to the sidewalk and was comfortably full, we were seated immediately (we had made a reservation). The food and service was great, we totally overordered but the apps (some sort of eggplant meatball as well as some sort of tenderloin ravioli were phenomenal. I ordered the chicken parm which I had to eat for 2 days after due to how filling it was and my wife had the classic sirloin, both cooked perfectly.",5
"Would def recommend this place to anyone looking for a spot for dinner, whether it is a date, dinner with clients or a group night.",5
Solid restaurant...the ambience is beautiful as anew restaurant should be.,5
Seafood bouquets were larger than most places. Definitely recommend the veal shank for two.,5
"Service was excellent, and the crowd was a bit older but attractive.",5
"What I was expecting was something like Carbone (all round superb, great pastas), but what I got was more like Costata (dull Italian steakhouse). The pastas we had were pretty good, there just aren't enough of them on the menu. Steaks were overcooked and pretty standard. Service strangely tactile - got the full hand on back and shoulder several times. They worked hard though. The real problem is with the boring food.",5
We had a very enjoyable evening at Quality Italian. The food was delicious and the service was very attentive. This is a great pick for anyone looking for a fun and delightful night out.,4
"Food was top notch and the service was outstanding. Some original items on the menu, artichoke Mac n cheese and the zeppole workshop for desert, YUM",5
"Went with a group and we're huge fans of Quality Meats. Quality Italian was not as good but good nevertheless. The chicken parm which is one of their renowned dishes came out like a pizza and it was flat in taste. While the chicken was moist, it needed more red sauce and mozzarella. They offered all these accoutrements to add to it which included honey...one must surmise that it lacks enough pizzazz to stand on it's own. The long boned rib eye is a must! But if I had to choose, I'd have dinner at Quality Meats before Quality Italian.",5
"Although this place is a bit pricey, it was a good experience. The food was really good, although I thought the pasta and meatballs were a bit too dry but it was baked so I can't knock them for that. The garlic bites were unreal! I got the ribeye and it was killer with the fresh steak sauce prepared by the table.",5
We just wanted to try the chicken pizza before seeing Book of Mormon.,4
"Great food, service and ambiance. Great for a special date night or occasion spot.",5
"Overall, great experience but you have to prepare yourself ahead of time for the menu price. At 5pm the restaurant was empty but filled up over the next hour. However, the tables are adequately spaced to provide a semblance of private conversation despite the increasingly busy atmosphere. Wait staff was exceptionally friendly without becoming  over zealous, as well as accommodating to requests, and very knowledgable of the menu / wine list. Apps, entree and dessert were all excellent across the board, including delivery time, temperature, taste, etc. We even added a side item immediately before the entree was served, and they rushed the order flawlessly and had it on the table only a few minutes after the entree was served. The only criticism may be the portion sizes are a notch smaller than ""American"" sizes, and the prices may be a bit over-inflated. This restaurant may best be for ""special occasions"" but absolutely willing to return in the future.",5
"I had a delicious burger from them for lunch.  Waiters were very attentive, friendly and informative.",5
Unfortunately had to wait a bit to be seated as the restaurant was running late. The restaurant’s back room tables near the window are very cold.,4
Great food and even better service.   Wine list is excellent.,5
The food and service is normally great at this restaurant this visit they get 1 star and that is even too much as they screwed everything up from steaks to appetizers and service was just very bad over all ,1
I hope that if we visit again they will do better,3
"The host said they would find us at the bar for our reservation and never did, which ended us sitting down 35 minutes after our reservation.  The wait staff was busiest tearing down tables and wheeling them through the restaurant / setting them up vs. attending current customers. Having us ask for a wine menu and later for water and the check. Which when it came had  an additional item added. Not to mention the filet steak was charred for crunchy mouthful.",5
A gastronomic delight!  I am still thinking about our meal(s) and that was 48 hours ago!,1
Love the food and service! One of my favorite places in the city.,5
"Really excellent meal from start to finish. Cocktails and bread in a little pan that you pull apart to dip in some really good olive oil.  Then, the Roman salad ( essentially, a caesar with these slices of lemon!) And finally, a veal picatta peppardelle that was delicious.",5
I cannot wait to return!  Yummy.,5
Anniversary,5
Food is outstanding!,4
"Quality Italian is just that...Quality! The food is excellent, service is great! Try the Chicken Parm , the Guac appetizer and the brussel sprouts. Salads were delicious too! Drink and wine selections were nice. I would highly recommend this restaurant.",4
"For a Saturday night reservation I was surprised at how many families with young children there were, so I would say this is a more kid friendly space.  I hated our table position (it was freezing and there were gusts of wind coming up the stairs all night).  The server was great, extremely attentive and patient.  The only negative on service was that they didn't crumb our table after appetizers.  The bread left a lot of crumbs around, it looked messy and it didn't seem that anyone of the servers or bussers even noticed it.",4
"Elegantly casual with a variety of Italian styles cuisines.  $$$ of four in price, and recommend it for a variety of occasions.",4
"great food, pretty decor, excellent service ",5
A bit loud but overall a great experience,4
"Went to QI before the theater and to celebrate my husband’s birthday. Our meal was delicious, though expensive. This isn’t unusual in nyc but overall the options are all pricey. We shared a kale salad which was light and fresh. Hubby had a raw tuna app which he’s still raving about. Then he had the Dover sole which was light and fluffy. I had the gnocchi and have to say it was the best I’ve ever had...light airy pillows in a leek sauce, though the portion was a bit small. Would have liked more non-seafood and non-steak options. While the final tally was high, we enjoyed our yummy meal and efficient, friendly service. QI would be really great for a group or family meal...more fun to share!",4
Wonderful place for lunch .  All six at the table had a  wonderful meal and the wine selection was impressive.  We would go back again which is a good benchmark.,3
Really fantastic meal and service as always. The chicken parm pizza is always the best. The only issue was it took them 30 minutes to seat us past our reservation time.,4
Had a reservation but waited 45 minutes to be seated. Overall a great dinner and would recommend to family and Friends.,5
I love this restaurant and visit regularly- tonight the food service was spotty and we were seated so close to others I could barely hear my friend .,5
I dined alone in the dining room & all the waiters was very attentive made sure my wine glass was never empty. What i really went back for was the pork chop it’s the best in midtown,4
"All I can say is my experience along with a companions first ever steakhouse, exceptional!",5
"Great meal, excellent service. Food was amazing a bit pricy but that’s what you pay for. Make sure to try the spicy lobster vodka sauce- made table side! Amazing",4
They didn’t acknowledge our anniversary although I had submitted that via opentable.,5
Amazing food,3
Food is good but quite pricey for what it is.  Great for a special occasion dinner but not for everyday.,4
"The service was outstanding!!!! You never going to be dissapointment when you choose this restaurant in this ""tourist"" area. Good food, ambiance and very, very good and friendly service",3
I wanted to love the restaurant but didn’t. Food was average. Service great a beginning of meal and non existent at end. One dessert came 5-7 minutes before the other two. Never received after dinner port when other diner received their coffee. Disappointing.,4
"Great ambiance and service. Food is great, but not outstanding.",5
"Went to QI for New Years Eve dinner with friends.  Service was fantastic as always but the rest of the evening was a bit disappointing considering we have been there for previous NYE dinners.  Music was overbearing and not at all appropriate for the clientele at the time. Wines were overpriced and the meal itself was just so-so.  Portions were tiny. Not at all up to the standard that we have been accustomed to in the past.  Not sure if I'll go back.  Also almost no recognition that it was NYE.  They did give us a horn but no Champagne toast (as they have previously), no countdown etc..  They missed the boat this year.",5
"Buen ambiente,  comida muy buena,  atención excelente.",5
"New Year's Eve was the occasion and it was spectacular. The food was amazing! Everything that we ordered was packed with flavor. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for a friendly get together, romantic date-night, or for one of those evenings when you want to treat yourself. We ordered the chicken parm(try the honey!!!), corn creme brulee, and fingerling potatoes. 5 stars across the board.",5
I only recently discovered this gem with a generic name.  Food is so good!  Never a disappointment and terrific service,5
Loved it the food was great,5
"We were told they were running 15 minutes late. So 15 minutes after our reservation we were seated, which was not bad.  The service was wonderful. The servers were very friendly, attentive and knew their menu. The food was delicious!!  We will be back!",5
Annual Family Christmas Dinner get together,5
Salads and chicken parm pizza are good. The rest of the food isn’t.  Service was poor and expensive,3
Great service and wonderful food. went for brunch and was delighted. much quieter than other nearby places. the breakfast risotto was rich and delicious.,5
We recently came here to celebrate an anniversary and had a great experience. The food was fantastic and the service was great. We were served complimentary champagne and dessert to our pleasant surprise. We look forward to coming back soon!,5
"Friendly staff, great food and service",5
"I have been here twice now and each time the steak is excellent (we have had the bone in ribeye and the bone in filet). There should be a better side selections in my opinion. Although we didn't have it, the chicken parmigiana ""pizza"" for two looked awesome, and I would like to try that some day. The dining experience, however, is marred however by the fact that the noise level is very high, and the tables are so close together that it is hard to get in or out without a wait person pulling the table back. That is very annoying to me. I struggle with whether to return because of those two issues (noise and extreme closeness of tables).",4
"Great, young vibe, but could benefit from a more imaginative menu. A little light on the Italian.",4
Great spot for our anniversary,5
"Chicken Perm pizza is oknpy available at dinner. Besides that, tiny portions for entrees.",3
Very complementary restaurant to Quality Meats. QI is much livelier and larger scale.,5
Food was excellent. Strip steak cooked to perfection.,5
Wine list on upper scale but great selections.,5
"Natasha our server was very knowledgeable, polite and responsive.",5
Fourth time. Never been disappointed.,3
This place was so good and so cozy I'd definitely come back again.,5
Everything about Quality Italian is amazing!!! From the ambiance to the apps to the chicken parm. Definitely worth the visit!,4
"Only 2 so we were placed in a corner. Waiter told us pasta dishes were only appetizer size but they were plenty big enough for main course. Food was amazing, dessert was outstanding. Good prices for nyc",4
Simply.... overpriced for what everyone's meal was.,4
Wonderful restaurant - attentive staff and well prepared food - it is very very noisy but it’s a lively and fun atmosphere. We were seated after a short wait but our server was always checking in to ensure our wine was replenished and dishes were discreetly removed. Great Italian cuisine - try the pork chop; it was more like a steak- it was cooked to perfection. Highly recommend this nice restaurant.,5
Food was great. But I couldn’t get the chicken Parmesan for lunch. Major bummer.,3
"Excellent food. Big place, quite lively i.e. quite noisy and thus not recommended if you want to have quiet talk.  Good for fun time with a group.",5
Chicken Parmesan is great. Very good atmosphere,3
"This was not our first time. We love the restaurant and the vibe. Food is very good and the wines by the glass are great. Our service was not stellar but it could have been the time we were there. Also, the spicy lobster penne vodka wasn’t what I was expecting. Presentation was very cool  as they prepare the lobster tableside. However, the alcohol they used to create the flaming fish didn’t burn off completely and it ruined the flavor of the dish. Other than that, the meal was perfect!",5
Very good.   But no Southern Comfort.  Horrible choice of beers.  Really?????  Other than that the service and the food was very good.  A little pricey.,4
Absolutely amazing food service atmosphere,5
"The restaurant is not as good as in the past. Greeting staff were not welcoming,coatcheck was understaffed, our server was disorganized and the food was fairly good definitely not great. It’s a shame there is no “captain”, maitre d’ , manager or anyone who goes around and makes diners feel valued. Or at least have better servers. Obviously business is not suffering and they don’t need my business. This was our last meal here. Too many other great options for steak and “Italian”.",4
"Great meal! Brought my family! Wine was ok, lamb chops were excellent! Thank you Quality",5
Very good food was a bit on the salty side but still good,5
"Quality Italian lives up to the reputation and name. Quality food, quality service, quality atmosphere is all here.",4
"Quality Italian was great.  My family went for brunch after spending a morning in NYC.  We started with appetizers, the sausage toast, scallops, whitetail, ricotta, and of course some beverages.  All were outstanding, tasty, savory, much enjoyed.  For our main course we had two chicken parmesan pizzas, there six of us and my son-in-laws love to eat.  They were amazing, very tasty, a bit pricey, but worth the experience. Daughter commented all was super delicious.",5
"Service was excellent, friendly, and the venue was very nicely decorated and well kept.",3
Great time.,5
Absolutely amazing!,5
AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING,5
"Waitress was rude - asked me about ordering sides for the table and I said no thank you, but she didn’t like the answer so she asked someone on the other side of the table to try to get a different answer and make a sale. She got a second no.",4
Once again this restaurant went beyond expectations! The food was excellent and the service was impeccable.,3
We waited an hour before our appetizers came out.  It took a long time to get the food.  Chairs are hard and uncomfortable.,4
Highly recommended!  Don't be fooled by the name this is where the locals that know go.   Amazing!,5
What a fantastic meal!  The spicy tuna tartare on carpaccio appetizer was the single best appetizer I've ever had!  Our waitress was fantastic - next time we come I'm not even going to look at the menu - I'll just go by her recommendations!,5
Great food and service. Very loud,5
There are so many good restaurants in NY - don’t waste your time and money on Quality Italian. It’s overpriced and bland. Meh describes it perfectly. We really wanted somewhere with great atmosphere. This place looked like a strip mall steak chain. The fresh rolls were nice and the oysters were good but the rest of the menu and meal was uninspired and dull. For the same price - or even less-you could have a great meal at a true New York steak house.,2
Just phenomenal as always.,5
Keep coming back for the sausage garlic toast and the polpettas,4
Righteous!!!!,1
"Service was not good, especially compared to how “high class” the restaurant vibes were",5
Only come here if you don't want to hear the people sitting across from you and you don't want to be waited on. Even complaining to the manager didn't help and took him 20 mins to even come over. Do not go for any special occasion or any reason for that matter.,5
"We went for dinner with our 6 and 8 year old, although it's a beautiful restaurant there were several younger children.  We felt very comfortable and had couples around us.  Food was exceptional, grilled octopus, lemon chicken,  filet mignon for 2, and dreamy desserts the ferrero rocher gelato💗",5
"Went for my wife’s birthday.  We each had a cocktail at the bar while they were fetri g our table together.  They were great, also $22 each - ouch.  I had a steak and my wife had a truffle pasta.  Both were amazing.  We shared a bottle of Brunello that the Som recommend.  It was tasty and reasonably priced.  Overall, great ambiance, great food, eith prices to match.  Great for a special occasion.",3
"Delicious! We ordered the chicken Parm for two, which is a mainstay on the menu. I’ll definitely come back for the Lobster Pasta. They make it tableside, and it looks insane!",5
"This restaurant was delicious, but the service is SO rushed. It's almost stressful. And my husband told them twice to remember a candle in the dessert for my birthday and they forgot. I honestly didn't care, but he was so disappointed. What made it worse is that the servers just put the food down quickly and barely say 'enjoy!"" or anything. Someone is doing something wrong in that kitchen..... or they are short a few people. There's no reason to be so rude to people who are paying $55 for filet mignon. The food was deliciousm, but I missed the warmth you get at places like Craft or Mailino. Nice restaurants don't have to be so snobby and rude. Because of that, I would not go back or recommend it to someone trying to celebrate a special occasion. We just had a baby and never go out... so very disappointed in my choice!",5
Loved the food and atmosphere.  Loud music at bar but then nice and quiet in the restaurant section.  Food was excellent.  It was our anniversary and  we had ordered dessert.  They came after and said they realized it was our anniversary and sent us home with two delicous cannolis.,5
First time here. Sam the manager was great. As was the wait staff. Food was amazing! Steak was cooked perfect and the gnocchi were amazing. Definitely coming back next time in NYC!,3
"Exceptional food, and service. Only my second time here, but it's becoming my favorite restaurant! I've already got my next reservation booked :)",2
"We thought the food was excellent, but we couldn't get service at all. We saw our waiter twice the entire afternoon, and the manager about 6 times who apologized numerous times and comp'ed us some items but still not sure I would recommend it.  We were seated right up front too, so no excuse, except they had some photography going on.",3
Service was horrible. Had to continuously call waiter since he seemed to forget to check on our table. Didn’t even get refill on our water.,4
The food is amazing. Was not made aware At time of reservation  that the day we went there would be a film crew shooting which was a big distraction. It’s a leisurely meal but very delicious.,4
"Other than having to wait a half hour past our reservation the food and service were very good.  The house made ricotta, sole, and octopus were delicious",4
"Beautifully designed restaurant, solid food. Nice atmosphere. Quality service.",1
Very good food and service. Only negative was the menu leans more toward a steakhouse than Italian.  Just more of an FYI as this was a really good experience.,5
"Small portion, quality not impressive at all. So noisy, you have to shout.",5
"Excellent meal, outstanding service. Our go to when in New York City.",2
"AMAZING AS ALWAYS! Never a bad meal at Quality! From the drinks to the apps to the main course, even the dessert!",5
Would not return.  Not worth the hype,5
Lovely!! So good!,5
Wow - Excellent restaurant in a great location.  Very creative menu...one of the best in NYC.,5
Filet Mignon Gorgonzola dolce 👏🏼,5
The BEST baked clams ive ever had and they have the most amazing chicken parm pizza! everything was delicious and the service was beyond amazing,5
Dinner was fantastic. Waiter was distracted but still okay.,2
"Outstanding food, was pricey but was delish!!! Will definitely go back.",4
"While the chicken parm was more than excellent, and the ambiance was great,  I thought that $26 for a glass of wine, and $40 for a small pasta dish was a lot.",4
"we were kept waiting for 30 + minutes for our table despite our 8 pm reservation.  We were then walked all the way to the back room and sat in between a table with 4 loud teens and the kitchen door!  The worst table in the house.  We ordered the prime rib for 2, which was good, but when we asked for the rest to take away, the doggie bag too so long we finally gave up and just left it there ... I will not be returning unfortunately.",5
"Went for lunch, overall very enjoyable. Foods were really tasty. Services were mostly good although could use more attention to details. The ""monkey bread"" is on a special menu which is a piece of paper that's clipped on a regular menu. Our menus were missing these so we didn't know the item exists until after the main courses came. When asking to see the menu for desserts later, we were given wrong menus which didn't have desserts on it. Manager (or someone looks like it) was walking around back and forth but never greeted any customer and obviously didn't focus on these issues we encountered. Anyway, we really like the foods. Waiters are all nice although we had 3 different waiters throughout the meal. Will be back given a chance.",4
Great food and great service.  Reservation system is a bit odd (changed number in party to less people and was bumped 45 Min later) not a huge deal as it was a last minute change and our fault.   Never had a bad experience here.  Definitely will come back.,5
"Food as always exceptional, ambiance was excellent. Most of time service is excellent, however this past visit and not very busy, service was down a notch.",5
One of the best meals in New York.  Great location.,3
"The most amazing meal we’d had in a long long time, food was just outstanding and the service exceptional! The knowledge and talent of the waiters was amazing and made the evening that little bit better. Great flavours, great choice, great service, great place to eat! Thank you",5
Great food and atmosphere. But VERY tough for kids. No kids menu.,5
The food is always very strong. ,5
Our server was exceptional. I wish I remembered her name. ,1
I believe she was from either Eastern Europe or Russian. ,5
Excellent! Food was great!,5
Staff and food was immpeccable. My friend fully enjoyed her bday brunch. Thank you!,4
Taste is ok but  the price food is very expensive. I,3
I don’t think it is proper price.,3
Normally don't leave negative reviews but had a couple extra minutes. Service was pretty unpleasant starting from the host to the waitress. More specifically they were a bit rude and pretentious. Had their noses so far up their behinds and talked down to us almost the whole way through. Food was good though.,5
Everything was amazing,5
"extraordinary food and good service, definitely will come back",5
This was probably the best meal I’ve ever had. Food was perfect. Service was perfect. The staff was amazing. Very friendly and knowledgeable. Our server kept making one phenomenal recommendation after another. Well worth the splurge.,5
"This place was absolutely delicious, by far the best meal over ever had! We’d never been before, and our server recommended perfect wines to compliment the outstanding lunch!",5
Excellent food and service!!!,4
Food was good and our waitress was great.  Slow for up front water and bread.,5
Food and service fantastic as always,5
"Exceptional menu, food, and service. Bar tenders excellent. Will return again",3
Honestly I was expecting much more from this restaurant which is defined as one of the best Italian restaurant in the city. The food is ok but not exciting at all and any average Italian trattoria could do better and give you a more satisfying experience.,5
"Ad Italian,  I can’t recommend it.",2
Marea was fabulous and we really had a great time. ,5
"The trouble was that they did not know who we were and I think its the Open Tables fault. This kind of things should not happen, specially when one plans a special occasion. Very embarrassing to show up after the reservation had been made and confirmed by you guys. Luckily the place was not full so getting a seating was not an issue. From now on, we think we are going to make reservations directly.",5
Average at best. Order was messed up when it came.  Server spilled my wine on me. Not a pleasant evening.,5
This is without a doubt the finest Italian restaurant in New York. Outstanding pasta dishes and the freshest fish. The restaurant is amazingly private and quiet even with its robust crowd. The lunch is an amazing bargain. Cannot wait to return.,5
Very special,5
My favorite NYC seafood spot! The branzino cooked in the salt is ridiculously delicious! The fusilli is always amazing and the lobster burrato appetizer was to die for! I’ll be back again and again!,5
"Very nice experience. The food was excellent and beautifully presented. the wine by the glass menu was first rate, and our server Michael was extremely professional and very friendly and attentive.",4
Outstanding! Great experience and proper Italian food (not easy to get in New York) - Bravissimi e complimenti!,5
"We had a wonderful time at Marea having dinner for two. We enjoyed the Prix Fixe, and based on the recommendations that we had read, we had: 1) POLIPO (Octopus) and  ASTICE (Lobster and Burrata) 2) FUSILLI (Octopus and Bone Marrow pasta) and ANATRA (Duck Risotto) 3) SOGLIOLA (Dover Sole with sauces)and  TAGLIATA (creekstone 50-day dry aged sirloin), and 4) BOMBOLONI (Donuts) and AFFOGATO (Espresso and Gelato). We absolutely loved each dish. A quick read through people's reviews, and you will see these are favorites among diners for sure.  Extremely delicious, complex flavors, and a truly memorable and delicious meal.",5
"Because we had such a variety of dishes, we each ordered wines by-the-glass instead of a bottle to compliment our food at the recommendation of our server, which was absolutely perfect (so much so, we asked for a list with each of the wines, as we enjoyed them so much!)",4
"I did pay particular attention to the service, as I was slightly concerned based on reviews I had seen here. With that said, I was pleasantly surprised - from the moment we arrived to the second we left, service was fantastic. All around the restaurant, not just at our table, the service seemed to be on point all night.",5
"Interestingly, we had a 5:45pm reservation, which is earlier than I would have usually chosen, but it actually worked out extremely well in that we were seated at an excellent table, and had a fantastic experience all evening.  ",5
A fabulous dinner!,5
What a delightful experience at Marea! Pasta and seafood stole the show. The service was on par with a 2 michelin star experience and the wine list was superb. Will be recommending this restaurant to friends for quite sometime. Thanks again.,5
"Absolutely wonderful Italian restaurant. The food, service and ambiance all work well together.",2
Once again a lovely meal . Looking forward to retuning again soon!,5
My  B-Day   was excelent there .,4
"I will  revisit  there with  my  hubby , sister n friends.",5
This is the best Italian food I have found in NYC. Truly outstanding!,5
Amazing taste & Service.. shared our special date for brunch this morning! What a an amazing time!,5
Amidst all the exquisite NYC food Marea is a must ,5
Every dish is exciting and  imaginative of course TASTY,3
A must for food lovers,5
Wonderful dinner. Great Central Park location. Restaurant is beautiful. Food and service were excellent!,5
Experience at the Bar- ,5
The food was notable and the service was excellent.  It was a very pleasant evening and we plan to return and to try it for lunch.,4
Great Steaks and decent service.  Would definitely go back.,5
"love the decor and ambiance of the restaurant. i'm personally not a huge fan of dry-aged steak (too salty), but the meat was flavorful. i do not recommend the trio of filet with the three sauces. if you do not like one of the sauces, you lose that whole piece of meat b/c it's drenched in sauce. ",3
"again fabulous atmosphere, which makes for a pleasant experience.",5
"Food was delicious, staff was great. Everything was excellent!",3
"Very, very pricey.  Good, but not great food for the bill.",4
"Our reservation was for 6 PM, we arrived 30 min early, and were seated immediately, and relocated to a booth without hesitation.  The waiter was puntual, friendly and helpful - very professional.  Being there early, there was no crowd or noise.  Dinner was very good, all 4 of us left full and extremely satified.  QM is a great find for us for after show dinner.",4
"Excellent steak, sides and deserts, especially the blueberry cobbler. Excellent tartare as well, crab in the crab and avocado appetizer could be fresher though.  Great service, love the homemade steak sauce.",4
we were celebrating my husband's 30th birthday and wrote that on the open table reservation. They treated us very well and brought us champagne and dessert to celebrate. It was a great touch and made us feel very special.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant to friends. It was a great dining experience.,4
One person in our group ordered fish.  It was completely underwhelming.  Not a good choice at Quality Meats.,5
I invited  my friends to go here.  They are  skeptical but end of the day,5
 all gave good compliment.,4
Perfect steak; incredible steak sauce; attentive and friendly service; love the meathook chandeliers,4
The food was outstanding and the bartenders were generous with their pours at the bar.  The service could not have been better and we would definitely recommend Quality Meats to friends and colleagues (who don't mind noise and who love a trendy scene and a good steak). We will head there again the next time we're in NYC.,4
If your a committed carnivore the double rib eye is for you ... steak retaurant that won't disapoint,5
Steaks were too salty.,2
"Great place! Food was excellent and the service was superb in a very relaxed, non-stuffy sort of way.",4
The room was VERY cold... probably 65 degrees or lower.    They put my family in a crowded little room that was VERY load.     The food was good...but for the money they should have paid more attention to other environmental factors.   We will NOT be returning to this restaurant anytime soon and will NOT recommend it to anyone.,3
"Interesting Colorado mining theme, very dark, cavernous and framed with metal lattices.  Clientele 75% suited male, loud and booming voices are embellished because acoustics suffer from wood ceiling.  Ambiance is energetic and robust, brutish. QM monogram on tablecloths is throwback to men's shirtcuff monogram. Second time visited, not again with with woman guest desiring conversation.  Salmon great but special bacon, lettuce tomato salad inedibly oversalted. Deviled egg amuse bouche unamusing second time around. Great place for men who want a big steak.",3
"My husband and I have been to Quality Meats several times. We have enjoyed our meal every time except last night. We were celebrating my husband's b-day with a couple of friends and although everyone's food was very good, my steak was served cold. I had to send it back. How can one eat cold meat in a steakhouse?! Unnaceptable, right?! The steak come back and was served at a pleasant temperature but it was not perfect and the fact that I had to wait while my guests ate their steaks was a bit akward. The waitress did give us an extra order of one of our side dishes which I thought was professional and a fit touch for the misshape.",3
I will return to Quality Meats as we enjoy the ambiance and the service is always consistent.,2
Food was pretty good but not great considering the price.,5
"The bread was excellent! Lunch plate was a bit too much for women, but the taste was good.",4
Filet mignon was way too salty. I didn't even finish half of it.,4
"Seared three filets was just ok, nothing really speacial.",4
Crab & avocado is too bland.,4
Must try potato crusted soft shell crab and corn creme brulee. They are very good.,4
Outstanding service and a creative menu for a superb steakhouse.,3
"We were a party of 6 celebrating our Mother's 60th birthday party.  Although the management overlooked printing a separate menu without prices for her, they did make up for it with a champagne cocktail to start and dressed up her dessert with a flair of chocolate syrup that said ""Happy Birthday!"" and a single, elegant candle standing in a dollop of whipped cream.  ",4
"The food was well-done, carnivorous classics rather than a more avant garde style.  For our mother, I think that worked out well.  For myself and a few others, I think this left a bit of the excitement out of the dining experience.  ",2
"A very unique environment, dimly lit for a couples or groups alike.  Staff was extremely courteous, knowledgeable and served all diners well.",4
Little bit more selection on the sides. Could have been received a bit better - 5:00 p.m. reservation and didn't seat us because not ready for approx 15 - 20 min. and no one came to offer us a drink from the bar.,5
"Great restaurant for ""Meat "" and wine list ..",4
The food is delicious. You know you are in for decadence when they bring the freshly baked herb bread. I dare you to not indulge. The chopped salad is absolutely delicious. Whether you opt for meat or fish; you will be rewarded.,4
What can we say about the ice cream desserts. The ice cream is worth the extra workouts during the week.,4
It is a lovely dining experience.,5
"My only resistance to an all out rave is that we were seated so closely to diners on both sides that we all ended up learning more about strangers' lives than is appropriate. I think at these prices,even tables for two can be spaced with a little more consideration for diners wanting to have private conversations. Otherwise, we really love Quality meats.",2
"I just have to mention that our waitress, Cheri, was phenomenal...made the expereience even better!",5
I've been dying to dine at Quality Meats for a while now and I wasn't disappointed.  The food was good and the ambiance was very upscale yet comfortable.  I only had lunch during this visit and I don't feel that it is ever the best representation of any restaurant so I've made a mental note to return for dinner sometime soon.  The menu was interesting and sounded delectable.  I tried to BBQ shortrib sandwich with homemade potato chips and pickled root vegetables to my delight.  Wonderfully appropriate portions throughout the meal and both the Reisling and Prosecco I sampled were perfect accents to both the meal and the weather.  I highly recommend QM for anyone in search of a quality meal consisting of more than just meats.,5
"Great service - we got a very nice table, they were responsive to changing the time, unique atmosphere, very good for work entertaining. Meat was excellent.",4
"Very attractive decor in the former San Domenico space. Excellent seafood (only 2 choices of non-maritime fare). Attentive service, mindful of our theatre commitment. The sommelier was quite helpful. It is very expensive and although worth the money, it seems like a difficult opening in this economy.",5
Love the food at Marea.  The crudos are incredible and the pastas superb.,4
A great place for seafood done with clean (yet vibrant) flavors. I hope I can go again.,4
"Marea was an outstanding experience overall. From the time we walked in and were greeted warmly by the staff, to the time we left full and satisfied. Try the fluke appetizer and the funghi risotto. YUM!",4
Pésimo comida cara y mala!,1
No regresaría  nunca!!!!,4
The Food was in part absolutely fantastic but the the men (the female/sommelier we had was great) that served was way way way off for this kind of restaurant.  There was some shocking examples that I don't even like to mention.,5
"Fabulous! Great food, friendly service... enjoyable experience.",3
"Went here for our anniversary and decided to take the five course tasting menu.  Although it is far cheaper than the likes of Jean George, it has no comparison.   The food was so-so, not impressive ; but the portions are very tiny.  Out of the five courses , we liked the Crudo(raw fish) best.  Not worth it in my opinion.  Maybe if we did not get the tasting menu, maybe it would have been better, who knows. For sure I will not be back.",5
Loved!!,5
"The service and the food was amazing, still one of my favorites in town.",5
Great meals and friendly staff.,5
The fusilli never disappoint!,5
"Pre-Theater dinner here on a cold January night did not disappoint. The staff were mindful of our schedule and yet served a well-paced, lovely meal for four in the time allotted. Recommendations for starters and entrees were ""spot on"" and the wine folks among us were impressed with the advice they received as well. Service was attentive and professional but managed to convey a true desire to please. Salads were imaginative and well dressed and the dessert surprisingly presented and delicious. Crab and tomato pasta was perfectly cooked and seasoned beautifully.",5
"Outstanding, light  seafood-centric cuisine.  Impeccable, unobtrusive service.  Clearly merits their two Michelin stars.",5
"Marea is an excellent restaurant. The food and service is great. It is expensive, but you get what you pay for, unlike many other restaurants in which you are  overcharged and do not receive the same quality.",5
"We visit NYC often and eat at fine restaurants most of the time. This is by far the finest restaurant we have had the pleasure of visiting. The service is impeccable, and the food is prepared very simply and presented quite well. We will be sure to dine at Marea every time we’re in the city.",5
Like always it was great !!!,5
"Incredible food, careful on the water. Waiter is very slow",5
Amazing staff & fantastic food! was there for family birthday and it was perfect.,5
Service was impeccable. Food was creative and high quality. Took my girlfriend there for our anniversary and we both loved it.,1
"The host was very accommodating. Antonio, the sommelier was extremely friendly and knowledgeable. The oxtail pasta and fusilli octopus were the standouts!",4
"The worst service I ever have, we only have 6 course and wait for 3 hours. Also we wait 30 mins for check!",5
"We came pre-theatre for dinner. We allowed plenty of time (1:45 minutes) to dine, yet still had to dash out before ordering dessert.  Food was outstanding.  We had gnochetti and sirloin as pasta/meat courses, tuna (tonno) and lobster appetizers.  All were amazing. Disappointed that service was a little slow, we waited nearly 10 minutes for first greeting, and had to wait for drink refills several times.",4
It was totally worthy making the reservation a month in advance. Met my expectations and the food was fantastic,5
Food was ok (desert was the best part). Service was excepcional.,5
The best pasta i’ve ever experienced.,5
"The service was extremely slow - the waits before bringing out the appeitizers and between each course were excessive.  The food was good - not amazing but good; however, the corn creme brulee was a standout - very good and something different.",3
my husband and i are big fans of convivio- so we were looking forward to trying marea. the space was gorgeous- much grander in feel than convivio. the service was excellent.,3
however the food was inconsistent- and therefore disappointing. i think the menu was too big- with too many choices in the fish department. as with convivio- the appetizers and pastas were superb. the cruso was excellent- oysters fresh. the pasta- a dish with clams and chilis- great. but the fish itself was just so-so in terms of flavor. i had the black bass- very nice but nothing special. my husband had the grilled rockfish with an anchovy sauce- he thought the fish was tasetelss. the wine- a fiano was perfect( great sommelier),5
the fish courses need tweaking!,4
"Had a wonderful evening here. The food was exceptional and the service top notch.....warm and inviting, but very professional.",5
"Great location, beautiful dining room, professional and engaging staff, delicious food. The only complaint is that the portions are, in some cases, miniscule. I don't like to eat large quantities of food but Marea seems to be erring on the ""way too small"" side. Other than that a great place.",5
Great for a business lunch.,5
"I go here every year for my anniversary, and this year was no different.",5
"Truly a magical restaurant, from the service, the som, the incredible food, will keep me coming back every single year.",5
Bravo all around,5
Marea is a wonderful restaurant - food and service are  both excellent. The room is superbly  designed and provides an elegant ambiance.  This restaurant is indeed worthy of its Michelin recognition.,3
"This is the best restaurant in manhattan hands down. If you like Mediterranean and Italian food this is the spot. This is amongst the best restaurants in Columbus circle and I feel it’s probably one of the best in the world. The wine selection by ten glad and bottle is bar none to any other place in manhattan.  The raw seafood is definitely the best I have ever had outside of marseille  France. The bone marrow and octopus pasta is what they are known for and it’s simply heaven. The cocktail list is also amazing. The best thing to do is the pre fix menu.  There is so much to say from the decor, waitstaff and the food execution that maybe it may not be the most out there culinary experience like other 3 Michelin stars but is definitely the most solid meal you get anywhere in the world and is definitely the best 2 Michelin Star restaurant I have ever been to.",5
"The restaurant was amazing! Our server was great and accommodating. We wanted non-alcoholic drinks, and she suggested a few options that were not on the menu after we told her our personal taste preferences. All the food came out after each previous plate was finished. Beautifully plated and was the best Italian food I've had. We had the Dentice, Canestrelli, Gnocchetti, and Tagliata off the dinner menu. My favorite was the Canestrelli, and my boyfriend's was the Gnocchetti.",5
"Would recommend for dates/anniversaries, really romantic.",5
Truly one of the best meals of my life. All around amazing.,5
"Service certainly could be improved.  The servers lacked polish and the front desk did not seem to know what they were doing.  Décor (especially flowers) also needs a professional touch.  Food, on the other hand, was quite good.",5
"Great food, great care, great service, definitely will return when I'm back in NYC!",3
"The food was delicious. All the staff in the restaurant help each other, the service was outstanding .......,We had a wonderful dinner experience !!!",5
Feel so gooooood,5
The entire experience was outstanding.    We will be back.,5
Marea is a Rock Star in cuisine and customer service. ,4
Made our Christmas Day even more special. ,3
A dining experience to be remembered. ,4
exellent. very very tasty steaks.,5
"A bit pricey, but the sirloin steak I had may have been the best I've tasted in years, and I really liked the steak sauce they prepared (at the table) too.  Fun waitress had a great ""New York attitude"", and a good wine recommendation.  We actually went back for cocktails the next night (after an inferior dinner at a famous restaurant close by).",5
I had never been to Quality Mets before and thoroughly enjoyed everything I ate. The portions were adequate and most importantly delicious!,5
"This was my first time to Quality Meats, it was highly recommended and did not disappoint!  I came with a few co-workers for Restaurant week and we all enjoyed.  I cannot wait to come back and try the regular menu!",5
We really enjoyed our lunch- food and service were excellent.  I would absolutely go backa again,4
I was very pleased with their service as we were there for a restaurant week lunch and we were not at all pushed to order extras.,4
Best food we have had there to date,4
Delicious rib-steak. The service was also very good.,4
"if you can only choose 1 steakhouse in NY to eat at, make sure it's this one. i have eaten at every single one of them over the years. the rest of them are all the same, same crowd, same side items, same dessert items.... blah blah blha.",5
"this place has all the ""standards"" but they have a few otheer signature items.",2
"Quality Meats is not a place to go for a party of two. All of the pair dining tables were along the perimeter of the stairs or against the back wall by the wine cases, so you either had people walking by you all the time or waiters bending over (over your food) to reach for wine bottles. The food was okay but there are far better steakhouses in the area that provide better service and ambiance.",2
"The evening (anniversary) began delightfully and ended with our taste buds in heaven.  Starting with very tasty sweet west coast oysters - the waitress’ recommendation (and I know my oysters), it only got better with the second course, a savory steak tartare -mixed at the table – and the best and meatiest crab cake ever (and I have had many). Entrees were a mouthwatering, flavorsome and tender steak (again, a great recommendation by our wonderful and knowledgeable waitress) – and, if you want that extra kick, they mix a steak sauce at your table.  The John Dory fish was light, cooked to perfection and the pineapple sauce completed this delicious dish.  The sides are too difficult to decide on so feel free to order like tapas in a Spanish re",5
"this smith&wollensky spin off is uber-trendy.  a ribeye with a 10 inch bone.....great if you're trying to sex someone up subliminally.  the meat itself was tasty, an aged ribeye, it had a bit of the odd taste that aged meats have and was tender, cooked perfectly.  i opened with the bone marrow.....okay this is the cheapest piece of meat, a dog bone, $9 for two very little marrows, come on guys, your food cost on this is nothing....splurge a little give us 4 or 6, they do in paris.  green goddess salad was good, very sublime.  we had the duck fried potatoes, good, especially the ones next to the pan.  spinach, exactly what you'd expect from a steak house.  wine list..uninspired.  lots of predictable wines listed, no descriptions nor wine guy",4
"it was great, we where on our honey moon trip and they gave us a glass of champagne at the begining and after dinner we had a bottle of champagne as a gift of Quality Meats. Great Dinner, Thanks...",5
"Great non-traditional steakhouse.  Very original decor with two levels of dining.  Many unusual items on the menu.  Rack of lamb for two was outstanding.  Seafood tower appetizer was also wonderful.  Carefully prepared sides -- gnocchi to die for.  Wine list had quite a number of very reasonably priced entries given the pricing point of the restaurant.  Service was good, although bloody mary came unstirred and without something to stir it and an order for tea with dessert was forgotten.",5
Corn Creme Brulee was amazing!  Filet was not bad either - we had a great time.,5
fabulous dinner and great steaks! we enjoyed the meal tremendously,4
good vibe in dining room,2
"Didn't meet expectations at all... We were left wanting more... the appetizers were okay.  The entree was very disappointing (steak with blackberry jam... thats all... and raw pork... a bit unsettling).  The desserts however were fantastic.  A highlight in an otherwise dim meal.  Our server, Cory was knowledgable and affable, but couldn't make up for the food...",2
Waitress rude and the food was cold.,4
"The cuts were as good as it gets, plus the appetizers were very interesting. Not to be missed the Quality Potato and the Bone Marrow!",3
Mediocre experience. Food was decent but far from spectacular.,2
Too loud Too crowded.  Bring back Manhattan Ocean Club.,4
great chocolate dessert,4
The dining experience was excellent.  The food and atmoshpere were extremely pleasureable.  I would highly recommend this to anyone.,4
"Great steak and ambiance!  The restaurant is unique in it's layout, which is fun, but can make a trip to the washroom a bit of a chore depending on what part of the restaurant you are in.  Service was great.  Highly recommended.",5
"Food,Service,Ambiance and portions- GREAT! Will not disappoint!",4
"I love the upscale farm house feel of this place. It was a very unique experience. The lady and gentleman at the front greeted us with smiles and the service was very attentive. The food was just as amazing. The blackberry steak was so good I cleaned me plate. I went for restaurant week but I would definitely go back and try other things. The price is at the higher end but totally worth it. This place is perfect for a date, lunch, or a great hearty meal with a bunch of friends.",4
"very good food, and service and pretty room.",3
the wait staff could have been more knowledgeable about the menu. The waiter did not identify himself and when asked about specifics about several dishes really could not discribe them. Nevertheless the overall experience was good.,3
Not as good as previous restaurant weeks as no Steak Tartare which I always eat at this restaurant ( also rest of the year),4
luvvit,4
We've been there a couple of times now for lunch or dinner and it has always bee great.  I guess that's why we keep going back!  ,4
We recommend to anyone.,2
"Outstanding service and food, great location, the decor is creative and comfortable. If you love a good steak, this is the place!",5
"I was disappointed with the overall experience and wouldn't recommend. We had a 9pm reservation and weren't seated until after 9:30pm. The waiter recommended the trio of filets to me (which I happily ordered), and that they be cooked medium.  They came to the table very rare. One of the trio was decently cooked (and I was hungry), so I ate that while the two others were sent back. They came back with a new full trio which was medium-well and one was very well done with barely any of the sauce it was supposed to have on it. I picked at the new plate, but it was not very appetizing. I had a bite of the sirloin that my dining partner had ordered and it was okay (better than my trio). The wine and appetizers were the only highlights.",4
Enjoyed myself very much.,5
Great Service.  Cory T. is the greatest waiter ever: award-worthy.,4
"Quality Meats is the best steakhouse in New York City that I have ever gone to so far. I have tried many others, and I always go back to QM. Highly recommended.",3
"Great food! But please do not bring the entree before one finishes the appetizer, even if it is a busy weekday lunch in midtown and it is a restaurant week menu.",2
"Service was excellent and efficient.  The bread from the open faced sandwich was very difficult to cut through and chew, though the flavor of the meat was fine.  Delicious avocado and crab salad.  Dining partner had the Restaurant Week Price Fix, thought it was very good, but was not enthralled with the steak.  Ambiance is fantastic.  Overall, great for a special lunch experience.",1
This was the most disappointing NYC steakhouse experience that I have had in my 15+ years living in Manhattan.  I got the bone in sirloin prepared medium which was delivered to our table medium rare.  The steak was bland tasting with no flavor and no crispiness on the outside.  One of our other dining companions got the 3 mini filets each with a different sauce preparation.  These were ordered medium as well and arrived at the table medium well and looked like they had been sitting under a heat lamp for 15+ minutes -- a grayish tint to the filets.  The other problem we had was that we ordered an $80 bottle of wine and had to pour all but the first glass ourselves while at least 4 wait staff members lingered in our dining section.,4
"so disappointed, this is the 2nd time i was there, the first time was a good experience.",4
the ribeye for 2 was like leather.,5
the whole french wine section was missing out of the wine list.,4
couldn't find server for about 1/2 hour.,2
"Great overall experience - food, service, etc was all great.  The only problem was that there were a bunch of flies near our table in the back that wouldn't go away.  It was quite annoying and kind of gross.  By the time our food came they had flown away, but it was just a little strange and, as I said, gross.",4
Pete,5
"We were extremely disappointed with the service.  This was the 12th time we have dined at QM and were floored by how poorly we were treated by our server.  The host staff was delightful, our server assistant was the only staff member who paid attention to us and the manager never came over to check on us.  We would have certainly let the manager know we had very poor service.  It's a shame because the food was very good, as always.  ",3
Our appetizer arrived before our cocktails.  We had to ask our server asssitant about our cocktails and she immediately brought them to us.  We were not served an amuse bouche like every table around us.  Our wine was not decanted.  We really felt slighted.  It will be a long time before we go back if at all,4
The filet trio was amazing.  The sides are quite large so go with a group and try several sides.,5
"Loved the food and atmosphere, but service was impersonal and not great.",5
very enjoyable evening- we are already talking about our next visit and what we wan to order- the corn creme brulee was out of this world!,1
best steak in town,4
Quality Meats is one of our favourite restaurants in NYC. We celebrated a birthday here with out of town guest this time.  The service was outstanding and the food is incredible...beef and fish...MUST TRY THE QM Potato!!  Our waiter and the staff made this a very special occasion with lovely attention to details.  THANK YOU!,5
Love you all at QM!,3
Terrible food. Over cooked our steak twice. Air condition wasn't working. Noisy.local diner steak is way better.,4
"In am empty restaurant at 5pm in the evening, it is inexcusable to seat a party of 2 next to a very loud party of 6.  ",4
"Food and service were great, but we couldn't even converse over dinner because of the table next to us.",3
"Quality Meats was recommended by a friend and our group of four guys enjoyed everything about it. We were in NY for some baseball games and this would be a great place for a business lunch or group dinner. Steaks were nice,service was excellent and I just hope the place grabs hold in New York City.",4
"The restaurant is overrated. Our waiter RUSHED us from the very beginning--he asked us every 5 minutes for the first 20 minutes if ""we knew what we wanted."" We responded no, we need more time at least 3 times. We aren't picky-choosy types, we just needed to time to read the many menus given to us! We had an 8:30 reservation on a Wed., our table definitely wasn't going to be turned over to other guests after we were done, he just wanted us in and out. He proceeded to write us off as ""not worth it"" once we just ordered beer and a glass of wine rather than a pricey bottle. I wouldn't go back. And the making steak sauce at the table scheme? The amount we were given was paltry and it tasted way too much like ketchup and needed much more spice.",3
"I have been to this restaurant twice and just LOVE it!! The service is always the best, very friendly, nice servers. The food is delicious especially the steaks and the homemade ice cream. Will definitley go back again and again!! One of my favorite places and the location couldn't be better!! Just LOVE IT!!",4
"awesome bread.  lots of business persons doing lunch.  did i say awesome bread?  not too expensive, considering the quality.  decor is well thought out and very nice.  very clean.",2
The food was fantastic but came out undercooked and hat to be sent back. I looked a bit silly as i had picked the restraunt for my boss and his partner and had been raving about it. The food was (when it had been cooked properly) wonderful. So it was just a bit dissapointing tat it did d not come out that way. Our waiter was terrific.,5
"This is a good twist on a ""steak joint"" with more interesting side dishes and ambiance than usual. loved the decor and the wine racks encircling the staircase. Service was great, food excellent, ice creams to die for.",4
"Cab driver by day, Quality Meats server and host by night?  ",4
"The host of the restaurant looked panicked and was sweating. When we were seated, the waiter proved to be less knowledgeable about the menu, cuts of meat, or wine than myself, which isnt really saying much. If it wasnt for the staff of 5 who eventually served the table, the who dinner would have been inexcusable. ",2
"I won't be going to Quality Meats again soon.  The manager should take note of the on-point service, and food equal to the task that you can get just up the street at Del Friscos.",5
"The Green Goddess Salad is fantastic.  The bone-in rib eye is something out of the Flintstones, but it is wonderful.",4
The hostess glaringly rolled her eyes at us when we asked to not sit next to the kitchen.  It was early and there were many open tables.  What an unpleasant beginning to an otherwise wonderful experience!,4
"went with a party of 5, all of which love steak, got a great corner table under the stairs booth style, more than enough space. Thats when the positives ended. Got the large seafood appetizers, 3 layers that looked impressive but it was lumpy not too fresh tasting. Our steaks were lukewarm/cold and one order was forgotten. The missing one came out pretty fast hot but had no taste. No one at our table thought any of the food was memorable and it was as expensive as the top steakhouses. The worst thing was our waiter left our 2nd bottle of wine we ordered at our table with a promise to return to open it but it remained unopened for 15 minutes. Honestly a great looking spot but theres great steakhouses in nyc and this is not one of them.",4
The service was exceptional.,5
Excellent food and wine as always. Service was a little patchy this time until the servers figured out whose table it was.,3
"excellent steaks, fantastic selection and quality. Appetisers were good but not 100% there. For example a lobster cocktail was reconstructed down to a lobster on seaweed on ice with a trio of sauces. The ice effectively cut off the flavor, and with only a standard knife and fork it was difficult and painful to excavate the flesh. No finger bowl meant dirty hands, a ruined napkin and a trip to the washroom mid-course to clean up. ",4
"But it's all about the Quality Meats and I must repeat, the steak was fabulous. It ain't cheap: $300 for two with two appetisers and two mains and two sides plus wine. Peter L's in Brooklyn has better steak, but for Midtown West, this place was fine.",5
"Spotty service best. Can cook better steaks myself. Loud room made conversation impossible, especially after a table of 20 showed up next to us. Was seated between a table of 20 and the entrance to the wine cellar. Unacceptable.",3
This restaurant is a splurge for us but was well worth it.,5
Great birthday celebration wit my Wife,5
"the food was really great more than my expected.  i just concern the room is a bit loud, so if we want to to talk, it won't work.",5
Exceptional Service and excellent food. Will be seeing me there often.,4
"First, I appreciate a sommelier that asks you how much you want to spend before advising on wine. We got great advice and didn't break the bank (although it would be easy to do here).",5
The food is exactly what you expect from a two-Michelin star establishment--near flawless. I assume they have guys catching their seafood because it would be hard to improve the quality.,5
The dining room was well-staffed and the atmosphere was low-key (with a great jazz playlist).,1
This experience was what we wanted--memorable.,4
Food was excellent. Service was excellent.,5
"My brother had the cauliflower appetizer, which was surprisingly delicious. I had the astice, which was good but not as tasty as the cauliflower, in my opinion. For the entree, we both had the fusilli pasta, which was really good. Great ambience and excellent service. I thought the prix fixe lunch was reasonably priced (at least for an upscale restaurant) but the champagne was way too expensive. Oh, and the sorbet they make in-house is absolutely PERFECT!!!",5
"Such a disappointment. Everything about the restaurant felt rushed and amateurish. The initial host greeting was cold and impersonal. After being seated and handed menus, our server greeted us with ""are you ready to order yet?""",5
"The fluke crudo was butchered, unseasoned, and flavorless. The scallops appetizer was likewise flavorless, the scallops were unseasoned and poorly seared.",5
"The funghi risotto was unattractively plated and although flavorful, was tragically undercooked. I like al dente risotto, not raw granules of rice. We sent back the pasta because they'd mistakenly made it with gluten free pasta.",5
"We skipped dessert because at this point our server didn't seem to care that things weren't going well, and no sign of management anywhere. I would have loved to say something to someone in the moment however at no point were we asked how things were going.",3
Service was transactional at best. I'm sure others have had different experiences but I won't be back.,5
As always the food was phenomenal. The service seems to have been a bit off. The host was very rude and dismissive of my party on entering and departing.  Wait staff was attentive but lacking some tact and smoothness.,3
"This is as good as it gets, and you pay for it.   This is our special occasion place before our annual opera.   Very innovating with wonderful choices up and down the menu.  Highly recommend the bone marrow pasta and crudos.   Broad wine list.   Good for celebrity watching; Paul McCartney two tables away.   Be prepared for $100+ per person.",2
"Love this restaurant very much! The atmosphere is romantic and cool, the dishes are very creative and delicious, original Italian! The seafood are so fresh. Will come back again!",3
"Absolutely fantastic food, decor and service. A truly impeccable dining experience",5
By far one of my favorite restaurants in nyc.,5
we had a nice time and the food were excellent,1
"Muy buena comida, platos de pescado mariscos y pastas maravillosas. El vitelo Tonato no es la receta original que se espera. Donde está la salsa de atún?",4
Todo muy bueno pero cuidado!! Los ayudantes de los camareros murmullan sobre los clientes y habalan con risas entre ellos. Un restaurante de esta categoría no puede permitirse este fallo,5
"Marea is outstanding in every way. Innovative modern Italian seafood--best in the city. The waitstaff are outstanding: knowledgable yet engaging, not snotty, and super competent.",5
Thank you so much!,5
"QI is good, not great. I enjoyed the apps more than the pasta entrees or burger. If you’re looking for good ilalian, this isn’t the place. If you’re stuck in midtown and need a decent, slightly expensive meal, it’s fine. Overall my husband, son and I have this place a B (Rounding up).",3
"Came in for business lunch with clients. We were placed in the freezing corner had to relocate, ordered steak medium rare but got well done. Food quality has definitely fallen off. Won't be back any time soon.",3
Chicken Parm is a unique experience and must be tried. Two or thee people can have at as a meal but it’s perfect for a large group to have a slice with their own entree.,5
"Sausage and Peppers app, lobster pasta w/ vodka sauce and polenta side were awesome as well",5
Celebrated my birthday here and it did not disappoint! Delicious food and drinks.,5
"As always, amazingly delicious interpretations of classic Italian. The service is outstanding, unobtrusive and fun. Love this place!",5
Very good steak. Service is excellent. They prepare the steak sauce table side. Be sure to order the bone in filet. One of my favorite places in the city.,5
AMAZING!!!,5
We were seated in the back room.  Not sure if just the people in there or what. But very noisy. We had a hard time talking .  There were 7 of us .  Next time I might request the front room.  If seemex the noise level wasn’t as bad.,3
"we went for the chicken parm pizza but it was such a disappointment. it wasn't even hot, it was lukewarm. the chicken was so dry and chewy. wasn't juicy or moist at all!! also lacking in flavor. huge disappointment",5
"After visiting 2 Michelin starred restaurants during our trip, It's unbelievable that Quality Italian doesn't have one!  Food was fresh, flavorful and memorable and the wine list was filled with vintages you hope to see and learn more about.  The highlight of our meal though was Heather our waitress, she was professional, friendly, helpful, and generous-all service professionals could learn a thing or two from her!  We will definitely return on our next trip!",4
"Order:  Hamachi Crudo, Veal Loin, Lamb Chops, Burrata Cheesecake paired with a lovely Brunello di Montalcino ""Poggiotondo"".",5
"We selected Quality Italian for Christmas dinner. Food is excellent, service was not as good unfortunately...but our family still managed to have a good time",3
Christmas dinner,4
They took a lot of their signature  dishes off the menu. Very limited.,5
Christmas celebration good food great service!,4
"Expensive food but worth it, very top notch Italian!",5
Foot was vers good but not enough warm. There was top much noise but service was vers good.,5
"Small but well constructed menu. Excellent quality of food, presentation and service. Wine a little overpriced but again excellent quality.",5
"Fantastic sister restaurant to Quality Meat! Wonderful food, atmosphere! Service was great and the wine list was fantastic as well! Will definitely come here again!",5
"My server was awesome sauce. Forgot her name but she made me & my wife’s anniversary very special without being intrusive , sausage & peppers was delicious the pork chop was amazing unbelievably delicious.",5
"Warm and welcoming service. Attentive waitstaff, and outstanding food!! Waiters always have perfect wine pairing suggestions for the many amazing dishes they offer.",5
Great restaurant. We will be back. It's expensive but well worth it for a date,5
"Amazing as always. The best bread, shrimp and agnolotti. Excellent drinks, too.",4
Great place for any occasion. Menu is outstanding. Extensive wine list.,5
Food was great. Service was good but food took a long time to come out. Also they pack you in tight so you are right on top of other customers which can make things uncomfortable.,5
"Wonderful service and food.  Steak was perfectly cooked, and the waitstaff went out of their way at every chance to make sure our experience was superb.  Would highly recommend.",5
"Great food good  ambiance , great service , variety of food",5
We come here every time we visit MYC. It is always flawless.,5
Had great time. Especially the cocktails. Very good.,3
"This place had a really fun vibe. The service was outstanding. We started with shrimp cocktail and oysters. Both were fresh and delicious and they came with 4 different sauces and all were amazing. Our entrees were very good as well ( veal chop Milanese and the double filet). We chose this place because we have had great experiences at the other Quality restaurants. Roberto was our server and he was very professional, knowlegable, and really fun! I wish I could remember the female servers name because she was equally fantastic! Overall, it was a great time with great cocktails, food, wine, and service. I will definitely go back.",5
reservation wasn't honored until 45 min after time Food is too ambitious,5
"We love coming here and the service was amazing. Alex was our main server, and he went above and beyond to create a perfect birthday dinner for my husband. We will definitely be back - especially for the chicken parm pizza!!!",4
Our experience was phenomenal.  Our server Natasha was experienced and knowledgeable and really ensured we had a true NYC experience.  I cannot wait to go back again.,5
"Food and service good. Has special veal and pasta very good and a side of their Cream corn Brulee, was very good.",5
"This was our first time at Quality Italian, even though we live only a few blocks away.  We were there to celebrate my wife's birthday, and they did not disappoint.  Food is excellent...we had the gnocchi appetizer; the dover sole and chicken parm pizza for entree; and the corn creme brulee as a side.  Everything was really great!  Highly recommend.",5
Amazing food and very attentive service,5
Excellent food. Great service!,5
We enjoyed it all ! Food and service were spot on !,2
VEry disappointing.  Limited menu. Disappointing lack of finesse. Very ordinary food and service. Expensive wines.,3
"Good food, not outstanding considering a 2 Michelin star rating.",5
"Consistently excellent food, which is why we’ve gone there for the last 8 years.",5
"Exceptional food, terrible service. The busboys were very cold to us.",4
"Truffle risotto is so expensive, and taste so baddddddddd..... won’t recommend people to come. Server talks so fast..... isn’t it a fast food dining experience?",5
Service was very nice but too slow at lunch time. 2 courses took 90 minutes. we made the mistake of ordering a dessert which brought total time to 2 hours.,5
A very great experience. The  pacing was excellent . Friendly and knowledgeable staff,5
Food and service were both outstanding. We went for lunch and it was awesome.  Loved every minute. We got there at noon when they opened and they were filled up within 30 minutes. Great time,5
Chose the 4 course price fix.  Every plate was excellent with impeccable service all around. Was surprised how generous the portions were.,5
Food experience a bit disappointing considering the 2 Michelin star rating,4
"El menú italiano basado en mariscos principalmente es muy original, y cualquier platillo por extraño que se lea en la descripción, resulta ser delicioso!",5
Fantastic...great food and service. Seafood galore!  Thank you for a delightful evening!,5
Nice for an occasion. Service was cold. Food was as expected.,4
Ever bite was special.   Great spot for lunch.,5
"Wonderful food and service with a classy atmosphere. Superior and very creative Italian inspired seafood dishes, pastas, etc. with modern flair and great presentation. One of the best restaurants in New York with a great location near Central Park/Columbus Circle.",2
The pasta and fish dishes are excellent and the 4 course option is a good value.,5
"Amazing food, wine and service and the prices to go with it.",5
"Always a pleasure to dine here. I recommend the Tasting Menu with wine pairings, the ricci, and the fusilli (of course)!",5
"Great steaks and sides and great service! We had a table near the bar area which was obnoxious....people peering at you as your eating and yelling about their day shouldn't be on the menu. The food was fantastic and our server very well informed. We both had filets and split the sides and an appetizer and we were very pleased with our meals. If our seat was better, it would have been the perfect night.",4
My sister and I dined early at Quality Meats. We felt a little rushed. I realized the next day that the staff probably assumed we were heading to a show. That’s my only complaint. The meal was outstanding and the service was spot on!!!,5
"Food was terrible, service was terrible because you felt pressured to ordered ASAP. The steak was over cooked and there was no one round to tell once the food had arrived. The waitresses asked why I didn't eat my steak, I told her but still nothing was done about it. The only good this is the location. I would not recommend this place to anyone!",1
Food was fantastic!! Our waiter was not happy that we shared an entree. Bartender (can’t remember her name) was super. Quality mule was best I had all week.,4
"Once again-Del Frisco's exceeded. Upon arrival-I was greeted by name and had my reservation notes on the requested wine brought to our attention. As we sat down, the focused on me and let me drive for the table. Service over the entire evening was top notch, attentive, but not invasive. This is hard to pull off--but they did it.",4
We will be there again next week because of the continued/consistent performance and great experiences we have. Cheers -NOD-,4
Good food buy very expensive.,5
Excellent service.Delicious meal.,5
"Excellent place. Food, service, atmosphere all get a 10.",5
"We have been to Del Frisco's several times and have always enjoyed ourselves. The food is excellent and the service was outstanding, as always. We have recommended this restaurant to numerous family and friends. A top notch experience!",5
The steak was perfect and the wine list was amazing. We will be back there soon!,1
"This is the 5th time I have eaten here-- now will never return. Much of the menu on line--checked out for others going along--was not available here. Table was awful--like eating in the back of a banquet room. Waiters switched off in the middle of the meal. $7.50 baked potato came without garnishes; had to ask for them and then be specific about what was wanted--not the usual array of garnishes offered. A sauce on the side for a steak was $14! And tasted like cornstarch and sugar. Dinner for two with tip came to $250!!!That was for four cocktails, two steaks, one appetizer and two side dishes. I think this place now is designed for tourists in nearby hotels who expect New York restaurants to be overpriced and mediocre.",5
Service was outstanding! Let them know we were celebrating our friends anniversary and we had a time limit given show tickets and they were great. Good suggestions on food. The food was excellent. The sweet potato side dish and three different petite filets with various glazes were a hit.,5
"The overall service was great by Brandon our waiter and all the service staff. My only complaint was I asked for my steak to be well done ( no pink ),the first time it came out it was still red, the SECOND time it came out it had blood still running out, the THIRD time it was burnt and was unable to enjoy or even eat half of it because it was so tough. Yes we were given a free dessert but after having a great expierence three years ago and then this expierence I am not sure I will return again.",4
One of my favorite NY restaurants. Manly decor. Well made drinks. Best steak I've had since the last time @ DelFriscos. VERY expensive but worth every penny.,4
"Had a b-day lunch w/ some of my favorite colleagues. We had oysters, bubbles & I had a steakburger while others had steak or fish. Food & service were excellent. Def one of the best burgers I had in NYC (same is true for both of Quality's other NYC outposts Quality Italian & Quality Eats). Not another stuffy NYC steakhouse--great spot w/ great food.",5
The corn brûlée was to die for. The service was excellent.,5
Great waiter,5
One of the better steak houses there is ...   just awesome !!,5
Absolutely loved it. It was my birthday I had a party of 6 in which 4 people didn't show up they definitely didn't mind just sat me elsewhere the food was delicious received cake on the house that butter cake to die for 😍😍😍,5
Food and service were excellent.  My friends and I are still talking about it.,5
Food was almost inedible. Hardly what you’d expect from the most expensive steak house in the city. I have had good meals here in the past but on this occasion it was beyond awful.,1
Always a great meal at Del Frisco's. Had family from out of town & wanted to treat them to a great meal with unreal service & they got it. Never had a bad experience in over 15 years of coming here. Staff & Food is always AWESOME!!!!,5
Food was excellent. Initial seating for 7 was cramped until we complained and we were moved. Waiter forgot to bring out gluten free bday cake we brought to restaurant even after we reminded him twice.,4
Celebrating Christmas,5
The best Steak house in NY hands down.  In addition to the great food the service is Outstanding.,5
"Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steak House is the place to go for amazing food and great service from knowledgeable staff. If you have a big date or anniversary, this is hands down the best place to go for a steak dinner. The meat is cooked to perfection, and the side options are all amazing. They serve big portions for the side, so be aware of that if you have a smaller group.",5
"The wine selection is frighteningly huge, but the servers will help narrow your options down, especially if you want to drink by the glass instead of the whole bottle.",5
"I recommend the thick cut bacon. If you love bacon, it will change your life.",3
Loved it! Can’t wait to return!,5
"We sat upstairs, food was delivered cold. Need to organize staff better. To many people standing around chatting.",4
Xmas dinner,5
"Good food, super crowded and loud. They squeezed in so many tables we could barely move. It was my 50th b-day celebration and they forgot to bring our dessert with a candle...a bit disappointing....",3
"Phenomenal food, amazing service and the best lemon cake you will ever have!",4
The service and ambiance were great.   Two of us had the bone in Ribeye which both were gristly and un-edible as it was throughout the entire piece of meat.  The manager quickly reacted and returned the steaks to the kitchen and brought two new ones back out within a few minutes.   They were much better but still not worth the high price.  The manager did apologize but when two of us are sitting there watching the other four in our party eat I would have expected a free steak or at least a desert to which we got neither.  Tad hard to swallow (excuse the pun) paying high prices for a meal and then not getting the best on the first pass.  Will not be going there again (had been before and liked it).,5
"The double eagle steak tastes spoiled. It’s actually dry aged 45 days, but they don’t really describe the taste. So, our table was concerned. The table next to us sent their steak back because of the taste. Something we should have done considering we didn’t eat more than half of what is a $130 steak. Also, the broccoli rabe was over cooked. Otherwise, service and ambiance was very good. The double eagle was a huge disappointment.",1
"Even though this place was very pricey for us, we thought it was well worth it. My hubby was impressed & he is hard to please when it comes to steak. We ate at a diff place last night & there was no comparison to your restaurant.",5
The 45 day aged Ribeye was tough! At $72 in NYC? Are you kidding? TERRIBLE!!!,5
"Mashed potatoes were bland and un-mashed, the creamed spinach OK.",5
Great food and service! Very expensive but it was our first time in NYC so went big. Only thing I would say is the steaks are huge so I would recommend sharing.,5
Amazing food with five star service from Dominic and the team!,5
"Food was absolutely wonderful, ambiance was great, but the service was lacking for a restaurant of this caliber.  Wait staff was very slow, we had to literally flag them down to get any attention and the bathroom hadn't been tidied up all day.",2
"Waiter was definitely not attentive, I specifically requested for a nice table as I had a VIP from Out of Town and yet they put us in the BACK ROOM ..and specifically requested for a good service,  and yet we didn’t get the great service! I was sooo disappointed with our dinner!!!",3
My wife & I celebrated our 5th wedding anniversary and had a great evening. The food was fantastic as well as our waiter. Wish I could remember his name. He was extremely friendly and knowledgeable. Overall we had a fabulous evening.  Highly recommend it.,5
This was the BEST steak we have had in NYC. We have been to ALL the top places. WOW what a hit this was !!,5
Mixed dining experience....one steak had to be sent back for additional cooking. Food overall was good...big issue was a very rude waiter...horrible service/attention...ruined the experience.,3
"I think my expectations may have been too high after my friend told me “it was the best steak I ever had”. My husband and I split the Porterhouse for 2. It had good flavor, but it was very tough. The sides were excellent, especially the carrot special. The ice cream creations for dessert weren’t bad either 😊.",4
"The service was very good.  Almost too attentive.  They have an extensive and very pricey wine list. I recommend their green goddess chopped salad as a starter. The filet mignon was delicious though I am not a fan of their most popular potato side. The potatoes tasted like fat, unsalted potato chips. Nearly flavorless. The ambiance is trumped by the noise level. It is very difficult to carry on a conversation.  Quality Meats definitely lives up to their $$$$ designation.",3
Great food and service. A little loud for a business meal.,5
Check they have beer. We went and they only offered Bud Lite. Management did nothing to fix situation.,4
Amazing AS USUAL!  This is our go-to spot in NYC.  Good is better than any of the steakhouses.  No question.,5
"This is my second time to host a business dinner at Quality Meats, and once again, we were very pleased with the meal, the service, and the atmosphere.  The food overall was great, with the exception of one of the steaks being slightly over cooked, and my veal chop being overcooked slightly, there were no complaints about the food at all.  The bone marrow, the salads, and the sides were outstanding.",4
"Del Frisco's never disappoints and my dinner with a colleague...her first visit, was great. The food, the wine, the service, and even our table location was fabulous. We didn't even mind waiting a bit for our table at the bar--it was hopping! That's why I keep going back!",4
"I went to Del Frisco's with work associates the first time, with had such a great time, I went back the next week with my friends and had an even better time. The food was great, the servers were friendly and engaging. It is now at the top of my NYC favorites list.",5
One of the best meals I have ever had. 7 layer lemon cake positively outstanding.,5
Great restaurant. Amazing food and great service. Every dish we tried was delicious.,5
"Our first time ... it was great experience. Service was attentive, knowledgeable and friendly.",5
Suggestions were perfect. The steaks were done right and delicious. As well as the sides.,5
We loved dining at Del Frisco's in NY. The waitstaff was great & the food was terrific. We actually went back the next night.,4
my favorite steak house in NY,4
We did have to wait although we had reservations but the food was very good.,4
"Fantastic meal and fantastic service! You never feel rushed, and are always looked after attentively without being smothered.",2
"One of our favorite New York City restaurants, Del Friscos never disappoints. The food was exceptional as always, the service the same. Del Friscos remains one of the premier steak houses in midtown, if not all of New York City. There is seldom room for desert given the huge portions, but we always seem to find room! A truly epic NYC restaurant!",5
"It was my husband's birthday & I called ahead to arrange a dessert with a candle after dinner. The minute ""Bambi"" arrived she ruined the suprise by noting that we were there for my husband's birthday. After that error she aggressively tried to upsell us(we had $50+ bottle of wine, a Sea Bass entree, a 12oz. Filet Mignon & one side). My husband was too full for dessert so when she asked what we wanted he said we would pass. Unbeknownst to him I was told on the phone that if my husband didn't order dessert they would bring a lemon cake with a candle gratis. Bambi said dessert was complementary so we ordered the cheesecake due to her insistence. We were charged for it & we paid without complaint but had a completely disappointing experience.",3
If you are looking for steak and all the trimmings.... This is the place to go. I've been there on a date with hubby and for a late lunch with my two picky little eaters (7yr & 10yr) they both loved it. They shared a big steak. They also have great salads.,4
Food was way overpriced for the quality that was presented. Service was outstanding. With so many steak house options I am very unlikely to eat there again.,5
Dinner and service was excellent!!,4
"We had a great time... Food was wonderful and we had a great waitress... Amanda. In fact, I have already contacted the restaurant to let them know ..",5
Great recommendation ..,4
"marcy Zwelling, MD",5
When we arrived we spent time at the bar and enjoyed a few cocktails. The bartender Angela was most accomodating and assisted in selecting the perfect cocktails based on our taste. The server was also most accomodating as he took the time to review the menu and specials for the evening. We have dined at DelFriscos previously as it is my boyfriends favorite Manhattan steakhouse. The steakes are always perfectly prepared and the atmosphere is both eceltic and lovely. Although I am not a serious steak lover I find the menu appealing with its seafood offerings and sides.,5
My guest indicated that the food was some of the best that they had ever had.,5
"Excellent steaks and our waiter was superb and very personable. He had just moved from Tennessee and was talkative without being pushy. If I were to complain about something it may have to be the sides. The asparagus were large and tough(yuck) rather than petite and tender(yum) and the mac&cheese was just plain inedible(and my daughter is quite the expert on mac & cheese - lol). Also, when I reserved our time, I had expressed a concern about making an 8:00 show at the Gershwin. I never heard back from the restaurant, so I reminded our hostess and our waiter while we were being seated about my time crunch. Well - we made the show (barely), but we had to skip dessert. All-in-all, though, it was an excellent dining experience.",5
"Del Frisco's was a great Manhattan experience. We started by meeting Mike, the bar tender. A true New Yorker with a personality that will keep you in stitches. We were having so much fun with Mike that we pondered eating at the bar, but finally opted for a table.",3
"Mike steered us to some of the ""best on the menu"" and some ""off menu"" items and our waitress was pleasant and attentive.",4
"The crab cakes are to die for, the skillet potatoes w/onions are a great side, and the ""bone-in"" Rib eye was the most flavorful and best piece of meat I'd ever eaten in any restaurant.",4
"The deserts were fantastic also, but not good for the diet.",4
"You may pay top dollar to go here, but if you love outstanding food, you can't go wrong!!",5
Del Frisco's continues to be one of the best steak meals in New York City. I've now ate at Del Frisco's 4 times over the last 2.5 years and have yet to have less that a fabulous meal along with all of my friends.,5
Great professional service with an attention to detail and presentation.,4
"Enjoyed as always until it was time for the check. We were 3 couples, wanted separate checks, and our waiter was not happy about that. Said he didn’t know what each couple ordered, which was ridiculous, and we were willing to assist him. He was not interested in our help and shortly returned with 3 checks, none of which were correct. ",4
We finally had to go with one check split 3 ways as we had Theatre tickets and had to leave. ,2
This was not fair to everyone in our party because of the difference in our orders. ,1
"As I said , we all enjoyed our meal very much, have been there many times, but our waiter had a real attitude!!!",5
They are a rip off  they charged $38 for a pice of fish that would not fill a cavity the place is a mess of a layout stairs everywhere,5
Waitresses are among the worst (waiters are ok). Clientele except business people are way below average.,2
A must to dine in New York-  modern steak house with updated twist!   Loved it- beautiful decor and great location !  Not your typical stale old steak place -,5
"Back to Quality Meats and it didn't disappoint.  So glad we chose this place to celebrate two birthdays (his 50th, my 46th).  Waiter was on point, helpful but not overwhelming.  It was a fun evening with great food and wine.  He had the filet special with mushrooms.  I kicked myself for not ordering it myself.  Dessert was brought out for both of us with candles.  Nice touch.  The sticky toffee pudding was one of the best I have ever had.  Thanks for making our night.",5
"The overall experience was zero: too many tables per foot square, no intimacy, the service was poor and way too fast- we did not have time to finish our first plate as the meat was waiting on the a side table getting cold, waiters were feeding us more than they were helping us enjoying our evening. The menu was not respected: a green salad without any of the ingredients on the menu (the green godess) for $17. I had to send it twice as I have asked for the dressin on the side, which was not respected. The overall price was outrageous given the lack of professionalism in the service. We paid less at the gastronomic restaurant “Les Nomades” in Chicago for the same number/type of plates and the experience was incomparable: we were taken care of, not just fed and billed.",5
"Absolutely fantastic. Been there twice and everything both times well remembered. Halibut , bone in sirloin, corn brulee, and chrispy potatoes outstanding. Yorkshire creamed spinach one of the best dishes I have ever had.",5
"Delicious steaks, appetizers, desert and fantastic wine. A bit noisy. Beautiful decor.",4
"Perpect place. I loved it. I will definitely come again. Most importantly, I did not have to say’ please less salt on the steak’. Thats why I loved it.",5
Everything was great until the end when the server was cleaning the table and dropped a small cast iron pot on my wife hurting her arm.,5
Food was excellent but service was slow and our table area was too hot.,5
Filet was incredible. Cream corn side dish was incredible. Perfect dinner.,5
Beautiful service! Food! Drinks! Just A+ quality,4
La comida excelente al igual que el servicio de maravilla,5
"Extraordinario¡¡¡ nunca falla la mejor carne, el ambiente espectacular.",5
"Straks and sides, Great. Wine list good if uneven but prices are high. Butchers board is hit and miss, standard fare.",4
Service is very friendly but rushed - used to be more on point.,2
"You have to be kidding me , right?  To ask me to review QM is like saying  ""duh.""  Just an awesome place to enjoy great cuisine and excellent wine.  Service is impeccable regardless if you are eating at the bar or happen to sit at the ""Mayor's Table.""  The staff always gives you the feeling  that  you like a daily customer even though you have not been back in a couple of years.  Cannot recommend it more!",2
Hands down the best filet I’ve ever has! Also the home mad roasted marshmallow ice cream was to die for! I’ll be back! Loved the atmosphere and romantic ambiance.,3
"We reserved a table for 4 for our Thanksgiving dinner as we were in the city for the Macy’s Parade. It was recommended to us by a friend who lives in Jersey but works in Manhattan. The location is only 6 blocks north of our hotel so we were able to walk. The interior was spacious with two levels  and furnishings and lighting were tasteful, warm and inviting without being too formal. We started out with oysters and the butchers board and both were very good. For dinner my daughter and husband both ordered a filet mignon, cooked medium, which they loved. My other daughter ordered the roasted chicken with lemon which was, in my opinion, the best entree on the table. I had the Thanksgiving special of turkey, stuffing and sweet potatoes. It was all very good and our server was excellent. The only complaint I have about the restaurant is the noise level. We had a particularly large table next to us that was very loud. Aside from that I would recommend highly recommend it.",5
Great meal especially their steaks!,5
"Holy Moly - I have NEVER, EVER tasted BREAD so bad in my life. You'd be better off eating wonder bread!",5
Server couldn't get the cocktail order correct - a  Maker's Mark Manhattan was transformed into a MAPLE Manhattan. ,5
So disappointing. 3 people - $450? there are so many better options in NYC.,5
The food and service was outstanding.   Del Frisco is my favorite restaurant in NYC!!,4
"This time I was on a date with my gorgeous bride. Food and Service was phenomenal, as always. Felix is the best host in the business. Love this place.  Very vibrant bar for our pre-dinner cocktail. A lot of fun!",2
This place never disappoints. Always an incredible meal and overall experience in an unbeatable setting.,5
Perfect as always!,5
Everything was Great !- as usual! The Best steaks in town !,5
"Great to be in the private back room when you bring three 10 y/o’s with you! Great food, just need to pick the wine that only has a 250% mark up vs those that are 400% +",4
"We went for a special family meal whilst visiting the Rockefeller, although busy the food was excellent and the buzz was great too",4
Très bonne nourriture mais ce restaurant est de trop grande taille et surtout trop bruyant.,5
C’est « l’industrie du steak »...,5
Il y a bien mieux à New York comme Steakhouse.,5
"We made a reservation for Del Frisco's for my husband's 50th birthday as a special dinner. From the moment we arrived everyone treated us with warm professionalism. They gave my husband a hand signed birthday card and treated the four of us to a beautiful dessert.  Our table was perfect - close enough to the bar to people watch and keep on eye on the games but also quiet enough to have conversation. Our waiter, Chris, was exemplary! He made sure we had water and bread right away and gave us just enough time to decide upon our drinks.  He was always available but never hovered and he made us feel like welcome guests. The salads were delicious and the perfect size. We happened to all chose the same entree and everything was cooked to perfection!  I highly recommend Del Frisco's and would also recommend making a reservation as it was a very popular place.",4
Awesome service and food.  Consistently good,5
"Our server, Andre, was outstanding as was the food!",5
Food was spectacular but we were stuffed in a small room well away the action and energy. Atmosphere was non-existent. Service was top notch though. Insist on a decent table or don’t bother.,4
"Although very expensive, the ambiance - loud and noise at the holidays, it's location - right in the heart of midtown at Rockefeller Center, and it's view of the city, make it almost worth the cost.",5
The restaurant was amazing and I would highly recommend it.  The service was impeccable and the food was amazing.  Great wine list also.,5
Great steaks. The service was great!!! Expensive but worth it for the anniversary.,5
"We had an amazing meal and experience.  From the card upon arrival to the surprise dessert, we had an anniversary to remember!",5
"fantastic service! Our waitress Brienne was very patient and  thorough in explaining the menu, ",5
the food was excellent.,5
Best Steak I have ever eaten.  Service was awesome.  Thought I had died and gone to heaven.,5
"Brianne made our special family night out even more special.   Food, drinks and ambiance were perfect.   Highly recommended!",2
"The place was gorgeous and the food was so good!  However, we were sped through apps and dinner, and the waiter even started cleaning glasses at the table next to us!  So much for a nice romantic evening!  The waiters were running around so fast that they actually banged into each other many many times!  I don't know why they were scurrying so quickly but it ruined our meal.  We ordered an appetizer and it was on the table within 2 minutes so it had to been prepared before we even got there.  I was really disappointed since this was to be a really special night at Del Friscos!",3
"I was looking forward to this dinner.  Showed up with my wife; we had reservations, found ourselves escorted to our table which was in a lower level of the actual restaurant.  There were mostly two people tables down there.  5-6 of them.  This area did not have the same feel as the upstairs main dining room.  I feel like we didn’t get the Del Frescos experience we paid for.  Food was great service was great.  But we would have preferred not to be seated at some “back corner” of the restaurant.  Atmosphere is part of a dining experience.  This was my problem. The restaurant is really nice otherwise.",5
Never disappointed with my experience.  Had to wait 30 minutes past our reservation for a table but I’ll chalk it up to the holidays.   Service is awesome and food great.,2
"Food was burnt, service unorganized - not worth the money.",3
"The joint is too crowded to begin with, food came slow, the wine sommelier was disinterest in explaining some of my questions regarding the wine list and didn’t even bring me a decanter for my Bordeaux vintage... Overall a very average steakhouse. Definitely didn’t deserve four and half stars rating.",5
This is not the first time we have been to delfrisco but our waitress Liz made it especially fun the service is always great and the food is exceptionally great if you love steak like we do. We had a family Christmas meal and enjoyed sitting near the window because of the beautiful lights and decorations. A really great night and we were seated within 10 minutes of getting there after making a reservation with OpenTable. It made it all the more enjoyable not to have to wait.,4
"Very good steak - especially the rib eye.  Thick bacon is wonderful, it is so tasty with a light orange flavor. I really recommend it. A little drawback is we had waited 40mniutes to be seated over our reservation time. But we totally understand because we went to for dinner in Christmas holidays. Price is a bit high. Staff were working hard to make guests enjoy their food and service. Thanks!",5
"We chose Del Frisco's for it's usual lively ambiance and great food.  Although I've dined there multiple times before, I wanted to share the experience with a new and very special friend.  We were seated downstairs outside of the wine cellar near the escalator - not ideal for a romantic adventure.  We asked to move inside the wine cellar dining room and were immediately accommodated in the spirit of the holidays.  We had an amazing time, food was perfect, service impeccable.  Couldn't have asked for better anywhere.  Thank you all!",5
"One if the Great NYC steak house, and a wonderful way to experience NY.",5
"From the moment we arrived we were rushed through our meal. It was apparent their goal was to turn over the table as soon as possible.  For a place that is supposed to be about ""quality meat"" this was the worst rib eye I can remember having out.  Our cut arrived to the table so cold I felt like I was eating left over steak out of my refrigerator . As someone who dines out several nights a week in NYC this was the worst dining experience of the year for me.",2
"Great food. Good service. Don't go to talk, incredibly loud.",3
Disappointing service for price.  Brought different year of wine without comment.  Made us feel like they were doing us a favor to serve us.,4
Best steak house in New York! Great options for vegans too!,5
The steak was ok. Scallops were amazing. I would order it more on the rare side it was a bit over done. Service was good. Matt was awesome!,3
The ribeye was excellent as was the cream spinach and corn brulee.    There were only two of us and we shared everything which was plenty of food.    The waiters were excellent - fun and smiling the entire dinner.,5
"After an hour and a half wait for the main course, an overdone cold steak which was tough and tasteless arrived. After complaining to the waiter, he said he would talk to the manager. After trying to enjoy this special evening, the manager appeared and offered a bottle of wine on the house at a time when we were ready to leave. After the hype of Quality Meat, I will never return after all.",1
Food & service was great. The noise level was so loud talking was pointless and we could hear at least 4 other tables conversations. But great atmosphere and service!,4
Excellent food. Great recommendation of wine by the glass.,5
"This was our second visit and it was just as good as the first. LOVE LOVE LOVE the ribs. The service is always top notch and the cocktails, delicious. Barron our server this trip was fantastic. It's going to be a staple visit whenever we're in NYC.",5
Love this!!!,5
Anniversary,5
Corn creme brûlée and the ribeye is perfect for a cold Friday dinner,5
"This was a GREAT experience all around. The food was AWESOME. As a vegetarian, it was odd that I picked the place, but the Crab meat appetizers intrigued me, as well as the sides. And, they DID NOT disappoint. We got the crabcake and the other crab appetizer in a spicy tomato puree and both were GREAT! The goddess salad was incredibly fresh, and amazing dressing. ",5
Our waiter so wonderful and answered all of our questions without rushing us. We also enjoyed the rustic decor. I would definitely go back!!,1
"Been to every steak house in the city, including quality meats in the past and I have to say the over all experience was lack luster. The food itself was subpar, the waiter was less than attentive(that's being generous).",5
Wait time for the food was abnormally extensive and when asked our waiter pointed to a server and said that's yours right there and ran away as that server began to place plates at the table across the room. In short long wait for bad service and food that's well below anything else available.,5
First time we’d been. Had a superb time! Can’t fault it. Great start to our amazing weekend trip over from England.,2
Wonderful dinner and service.  Thank you!!! We will be back!,5
THE FOOD IS SUPERBLY PREPARED AND PRESENTED.  IT IS THE BEST STEAK THAT I HAVE HAD  IN A LONG TIME.  BUT THATS IT.  THE ROOM IS EXCESSIVELY NOISY; THE RESERVATION WAS 40 MINUTES LATE; THE SERVER WAS CONFUSED; AND THE LAYOUT IS NOT FOR ANYONE WHO HAS THJE SLIGHTEST DISABILITY.,5
En familia. La mejor carne de Ny,5
"Great food, great atmosphere! We were visiting from Texas and had a wonderful experience.",5
Our daughters 16th birthday!!!! Service and food were out of this world!!! ❤️🎉,4
One of the best steakhouses! Incredible food that is always prepared to perfection. Great service with plenty of waitstaff on-hand to help. Excellent wine list with lots of unique offerings and special gems.,5
"I'm here for celebrating New York City Marathon by myself and have great dinner. The staff suggest glass wine is well suited to my rib steak. But for solo female customer, like me,  I won't suggest to order addition side dish. It will be too much to eat it. Finally, I packed my side dish to go. If possible, I hope the staff could suggest to have moderate dinner, not extra dishes.",3
"All around superb!  Expensive, but it was a special occasion and we had a great time",5
"It was too noisy for me. The tuna steak was very dry,when I mentioned it to waiter he just disregarded me. The waiter was really no where to be found..the water glasses were no filled accordingly. They also gave us desserts that were nomordered and coffee cold!!! I would never go",5
Terrible terrible service,1
"Not sure what's happened to QM. The last two times we've gone, it's been much less quality and service as before. We went for my daughters birthday in October. Party of 7. They ran out of asparagus, then they confused the steak orders - they all came out well done when we had a variety of ""cooked to"" specifications. Then they also ran out of the dessert my daughter had been looking forward to all week. ",5
Most recently we were there on Thursday for thanksgiving. The Thanksgiving specials all,5
"Came out cold. Completely cold. Not even warm. For the sake of saving time, as we were a party of 9 with a couple of small children, we just tried to eat it.  We didn't have the luxury of sending it back in hopes of it coming out better. But, the fact that they even served it to us COLD, was a huge disappointment, given the reputation of QM. ",4
"Sadly, I do not think we will be visiting again and cannot recommend it to our friends anymore.",5
Thanksgiving,5
We had our Thanksgiving lunch here while spending the holiday in NYC. All of the food was amazing and prepared perfectly. Very attentive wait staff without being overbearing. We will certainly return the next time we are in the city.,4
Horrible experience,3
Had nice meal on patio. Service was great. Steaks were delicious!,5
We have been here earlier in 2017.  Our dinner was just as fabulous as our visit in February.  The restaurant is lovely.,5
Great Service and Excellent Ambience. Highly Recommend. Will visit my next time in NYC.,5
"This is not your neighborhood vegan hotspot. This restaurant celebrates the  idea that beef is what's for dinner. I had a nice apple & fennel salad to start, followed by a 10oz filet mignon that was a perfect medium rare, which I accompanied with mushrooms and grilled asparagus. they have a very nice wine list, with a number of great by the glass selections. If you still have room for dessert, there are a number of good options.",2
Excellent as usual.,5
"staff was great! if all the servers treat customers the way ours did then everyone should have a great experience. food was great really enjoyed the entire meal. sometimes when you pay these kind of prices you feel like it just wasn't worth it. not so here! did not mind one bit when we were all done , well worth it!",5
We've been here many times. The food is delicious and the service is great. My husband had a porterhouse and I had a Salmon. We always leave really satisfied.,5
"Being the first time going to Frisco's we didn't know what to expect, only the reviews I had looked at prior to help in making the decision to eat there. Well, the atmosphere is elegant, tables are very spaced out which I love as I don't like dining right on top of the next person. We were seated in a booth which was very comfortable. The menu was on the small side so your choices are limited. The food itself was excellent! Pricey but worth it. I would dine here again.",5
One of my favorite steak houses in the country.,5
Too much. Over the top without the substance. Place to see and be scene if you are insecure or are looking for a sugar daddy. Get at it.,3
Great dinner. Seated promptly with reservations on a sold out evening,5
"We had a reservation but arrived early and were seated well before our reservation time! Somehow we got lost in the sauce and our server didn’t come to us for about 25 minutes. Hubby and I were on a date sans kids and didn’t mind the extra wait time (plus we were given iced water and bread to nosh on while we waited). Once our server came she was great, personable  and quick! Our food was amazing, one of the best steaks I’ve ever eaten! We saved room for dessert and the chocolate soufflé was delicious! Our dessert was comped by our waitress due to our long wait at the beginning of the night, which was very unexpected and nice! Overall we had a great experience and would highly recommend this restaurant!",3
"What a disappointing experience. Being a frequent visitor of  DelFriscos in Philadelphia, i expected so much more from NYC. Service was ok, nothing like the  service in Philadelphia.  The food was ok, again not on same level as PA. This was not the same dining experience i have, i felt rushed, tables crowded into small spaces, and wall to wall people. Extremely disappointing. Will never visit this one again.",5
"Absolutely superb! Food was delicious! Service was outstanding, ambiance was great and exactly what we were looking for on our anniversary. Del friscos will always be our number one place to go for any date night/ special occasion. Highly recommend it",5
Great service,4
"As always the food was excellent. The wait staff were knowledgeable and polite. I was disappointed by managements response to a servers error at the table, food was was dropped on one of my dinner guests. Also surprising to me was the poor condition of the men’s bathroom.",5
"5 stars doesn't do justice. 10 stars does though! This was our 1st visit and it was wonderful. We had reservations,but came( in out if the cold)in an hour early,and was seated within 10-15 minutes. Our table was near escalatorwhich was great for access to down stairs restroom and with a nice view of the street and other guests.",5
"Our server Bradley,was exceptional from start to finish. We never wanted for anything. He was very attentive not only to us but every guest he was serving. He knew the menu/dishes very well,answered all our questions and his suggestion of wine based on my fiance's taste was a superb selection.",5
"The food,was awesome,from the stone crab, wedge salad,steaks,so delicious,melt in your mouth (and cooked to perfection),loved the broccoli, cauliflower,dessert. Portions were very generous,in so that we took leftovers.",5
"Loved the ambience and that you are not rushed to eat,you can relax,talk and enjoy the courses thourghly as one should,as they are brought out as they should be.",5
Overall staff from beginning to end was great. We will definitely return and recommend.,5
Great food and great service can’t ask for anything better,5
"Lovely.  We arrived early as refugees from the throngs of Dec 26 ""visit the City at Christmastime"" revelers mobs the area streets.  They were kind enough to seat us (it was only 5:pm) and the service from thereon in was terrific.  The food was delicious.  Yes the lemon cake is moist and yummy - but the portion size was simply TOO much.  I recommend the chocolate mousse.   Go any day but Boxing Day/St. Stephen's Day when the area is to be avoided!",4
Amazing food and great service!,3
"Our family of 5 went to Del Frisco's before a show and it was outstanding! Our server was so knowledgeable about everything & she was funny, too. The lobster bisque was probably the best we've ever had, the steak was perfect & the butter cake was magical! Lovely ambiance and views of the busy streets outside. We would highly recommend it & we would definitely go back!",4
"Del Frisco’s never disappoints!  Delicious meal all around - steaks, Mac and cheese, seafood platter, Brussels sprouts - yum!!  AND an amazing wine suggestion that we thoroughly enjoyed!  Our waiter Thomas also went above and beyond to make sure our girls  (12, 7 & 4) were happy.  We enjoyed  a special meal here to end the year with family!",4
"Hearty steaks, gracious service, and luscious desserts are worth coming back for every special occasion.",5
"Waiter Francois was tremendous.  The onion rings were tremendous, so was the octopus and shrimp cocktail.",5
"A bit disappointed....expected a big price and that expectation was spot on, but also expected a great meal... not so much.",5
"Nous y sommes allés le 24 déc, petite attente à l’entrée, repas très bon la viande délicieuse, bonne ambiance, très bien situé. Petit bémol très bruyant et l’addition est salée à la fin",5
"The steaks,were phenomenal. We loved the ice cream, lobster mashed potatoes and lemon cake. Our little kids were so good because they could see out the big windows and the place was full. Plus they kept the food coming. We go every year on Christmas eve.",5
"Absolutely delicious meal!  Christmas Eve dinner for three. Ordered three appetizers, two entries and three desserts.  More than enough food and plenty of leftovers.  Highlights were the steaks:  wagu tomahawk would have been enough for the three of us, but I went for the bone-in ribeye.  So glad I did — it was amazing.  Restaurant was packed but no problem hearing my dinner guests.  Service was quick and well informed.  Only miss was everyone around us received a bread basket.  Not us.  BUT that just meant more room for what really counted!  Very pricey, so check the menu before going so you’re not in shock opening the menu.   Overall, well worth it!",5
Not a bad thing to say every thing was excellent from the food to the service,4
"The food is good, but not amazing. Everyone orders the chicken parm here, which is gimmicky given that it comes looking like a giant pizza. It's decent but no better than your slightly above average Italian restaurant. It's enough for 4-5 people for dinner, despite them recommending it for two people.",3
as usual the food and serveice were excellent - you do need to take out a sencond mortgage.,4
Fabulous steaks. I had the bone-in strip steak and my wife had the bone-in Filet; both wonderful!,5
Del Frisco's was one of the best dining experiences I ever had! It was wonderful!,5
Very good dining experience. I had to send a strip steak back that had been ordered medium but came out rare. I was told that the steak was medium according to the restaurant standards. The server nonetheless took the steak back and it was then cooked properly.,4
The atmosphere is nice for a midtown restaurant. I would recommend if you need a restaurant in this neighborhood but definitely wouldn't make a special trip to this place.,3
"Our group of six were taken aback by the noise level. There are no 'softeners' in the decor so at a busy time it's difficult to hear any table mate not seated beside you. That said, the food was actually quite good and not expensive by New York standards. For a quality place I thought the service should have been better. Not saying it was bad. The waiters were knowledgeable and pleasant, however one would expect the wait staff to be able to deliver the requested food to the person who ordered without asking questions. Also it took longer between courses than it should have with some minor difficulty getting a waiter's attention. Foodwise, everyone liked their selection.",3
"NIce atmosphere & very good service..food only ok..the ""famous"" chicken parm was a disaster..too many gimmicks w/ table side preparation…very good pork chop…great desserts..",3
If you want steak go to a steak house,4
If you want Italian food go to a great rest,1
"My second time here, we had dinner before a show at Lincoln Center, and was amazed again! The appetizers are so good and the steak is absolute perfection. Try the eggplant polpette and the caprese, both amazing! The bone in filet is the absolute best. Took a star off for the stone crab claws being overcooked and stringy, but 5 stars for service because our waiter took them off the bill and was extremely gracious. Got the cannoli cart as well, the pistachio cannoli is very good! Love this place!",5
"There are many great restaraunts in New York City. Visit one of them instead of going here. After being seated, 10 minutes went by and still no waitperson came to the table. People that were seated after me were getting served. I had to speak to someone to get a disinterested waitperson to visit my table. After ordering drinks (which took another 10 minutes before one drink arrived), I was told the beer taps did not work. This did not stop the restaraunt from trying to charge me for a beer I ordered but never received, a mistake I had to call to their attention. The food was below average. My $27 pasta portion size was barely that of an appetizer. There is no reason to visit this place.",4
"There are lots of choices in New York for steaks, I was very pleased with our meal at Del Frisco's. The steak was excellent! I had eaten at their restaurant in Dallas and this was even better.",4
A Fantastic Experience. Outstanding meal. Highly recommended.,5
"Food, Ambiance and service was outstanding! Went for my birthday and loved every minute of it, a bit pricey but well worth it.I ordered Filet Mignon and my husband has bone-in ribeye (both cooked to perfection) and for the sides we had skillet potatoes with onions (which was the best) and macaroni with cheese (which was abit boring), but overall delicious! To finish it off they gave us a complimentary slice of lemon cake(icing was too sweet, but the filling was great). I would definetly go again for a special occasion,and highly recommend going for when you're able to splurge.",5
"Good food, horrible service. Waited 15 minutes for water and a wine menu. Water was never refilled without our hounding sides came late I've been to del frisco at least 15 times, why do I get a bad table every tome? Service was just bad. Food was good though.",4
"Overall, the dining experience was very good. The service was outstanding. The food was excellent.",4
"Food was great, service great. But totally overpriced. The most expensive steakhouse in New York.",4
"Steak is not up to par with the top steakhouses in NYC. Filet comes with pepper, cut is not thick, I asked pink, waitress said, medium will have blood, came well done. Don't waste your time at this restaurant when there are so many excellent steakhouses in NYC",1
"We were celebrating our anniversary at Del Frisco's. The food was terrific and our server, Courtney, was outstanding. Indeed, she made our anniversary special. My only complaint was that I had asked for a special quiet table. They first took us to a table in the bar. When we asked for a quieter table they sat us been a group of 14 twenty year olds and a group of six - quiet it was not! Obviously, I wasn't going to ask for a third table and began dinner disappointed in the restaurant. But, with Courtney's arrival, I put aside the noisy ""neighborhood"" and enjoyed myself immensely. She was attentive, enthusiastic, and charming. The service was outstanding. Even brought us a complimentary dessert to share with a candle on top.",4
It was Great Experience - Amazing Steaks!,5
"Our experience at Del Fresco's was great. We were celebrating a special night, and the relaxed atmosphere, GREAT food, and terrific service really make the night complete.",5
"It seemed that the waiter was trying to push the more expensive $70 items that were not on the menu, then what was on the menu itself. We ended up ordering what was on the menu. We ordered steak medium-rare, but what came to the table was more than well done. They had said it will take 20 minutes+ for the entree to be done, and so we didn't want to wait for another 20 minutes over the first 30 minutes to get a medium-rare steak. My son said the meat felt chewy.",3
"We asked for a table for two, not near the bar. There were so many empty tables for two by the windows; instead, we were put in a booth that sits 4.. strange.",3
"Been here many times and it always shines,this time though the waiter was on a mission to get us in and out and it was a little annoying to have to make it clear several times we where not gonna be rushed!",3
The food wasn't as good as I had remembered.  Much less ambiance than the Philadelphia Del Frisco's. The pineapple infused vodka was excellent however,4
"A little disappointed in the dress code. T-shirts, baseball caps.",5
"Love the spot and the food, especially before the theatre.",3
Outstanding Service and Food. Highly recommend for those looking for a great dining and food experience.,5
Dinner was good; tender juicy perfectly prepared Double Eagle strip and cheesy potatoes. Mediocre Caesar salad. Large wine list with mostly pricey selections with a few for $200 or less. Room is huge and loud and for our Friday evening 8:30 reservation still filled with groups of white shirted work groups getting louder and more boisterous. Go with your own group and be prepared for the noise of the huge room.,5
"Dinner plans for my husband's 35th birthday went very well! Thanks to our waitress, Andrea, for being professional, courteous, and accommodating. We are also thankful for the delicious slice of lemon cake (with candle) my husband blew for the occasion. Delicious food, great service, and nice location. We'll definitely come again and recommend it to our friends.",5
"Traveling from Miami we didn't expect to find great fish dishes in NYC. We were wrong. The sea bass is melt-in-your mouth incredible! The steak medallions absolutely tantalized every taste bud --- the sides are enormous, and indescribably delicious! One must not visit NYC and miss out on Del Friscos! The staff is courteous, interesting and willing to do whatever is possible to enhance the dining experience. Make a reservation, sit back and relax, and let the meal overtake your senses!",4
The food is outstanding!!! Incredible!!!,5
Special shrimp appetizers were delicious. Nice atmosphere for a business lunch. Service was very good. Only complaint was that my entree salad had too much dressing on it. But I would certainly go back to try more of their offerings.,5
"We had a great table in the corner, and even with all the noise and energy all around us I was able to still ahve a pretty intimate conversation with my date.",5
"This is the Place I go when I want the best steak in nyc, and to impress friends from out of town. They never disappoint.",4
"This was our second time at the New York location. The food was excellent, very delicious. The service was great. The wait staff was very attentive, and always there to help. Our New York Favorite!",4
Our server was very nice and attentive. Our experience there was excellent. A little noisy for me but the food made up for it. I would def. come back!!!!,3
"The atmosphere was great and the service was excellent. The sauces are delectable. However, the steak at Del Frisco's is very heavily seasoned. The steak was a good quality and was overall pretty good, but not really my taste. I prefer steak to be lightly seasoned and to taste the flavor of the meat. If I return, I will have to ask for it with less spices...",5
I felt the restaurant was over priced for the food and service. We happen to be sitting at a table close to the kitchen. My son kept getting hit in the back when the waiters were rushing in and out of the kitchen. Also my son and daughter in law had Filet Mignon which was over cooked. I wouldn't choose this restaurant again when there are so many to choose from.,5
Our most recent experience at Del Frisco's was wonderful. The food was delicious and our steaks were cooked perfectly. The wine selection was impressive and our server was out of this world. We will definitely be back again soon.,4
"What's not to like - this has it all, great service and great steak - it's the total New York City steak experience. While other steak houses are notable in NYC, the floor to ceiling windows provide the New York feeling and city energy while dining.",3
"Been waiting for a great Italian restaurant with innovation, great food, great service and finally found it !",5
"Reservations a must, the pasta a must, salads big enough to share, and a feel good time !",5
Cannot wait to go back !,3
Quality Italian was a good experience.,5
It was interesting to arrive and see many empty tables after open table indicated therewas,3
no availability after 5:30pm.,5
The service was great.The staff was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.,5
The restaurant was much better than the New York Times review.,1
We really enjoyed our last dinner in NYC at Quality Italian.,5
I had heard how difficult it was to get a reservation and its obvious why. This place is a gem! The food is absolutely outstanding and not outrageously priced for NY City standards. This may become my go-to restuarant for special occasions.,5
We have been big fans of Quality Meats for years and just tried Quality Italian and absolutely loved it. We had the best service we have possibly ever had at any restaurant and the food was perfectly cooked and tasted amazing. Everything from the appetizers to the desserts is creative but also delicious. Some fun twists on classic italian dishes with a hint of Quality Meats. Get the Caesar Salad to start and the Lemon Tart for dessert and any of the amazing entrees!,5
Very small table for two people. Waiters had a difficult time serving because of limited space between tables. Very loud which made it difficult to have a conversation.,5
the steak angeloti is hands down the best thing on the menu but the chicken parm pizza situation is a must do because....well its amazing and hasn't wanted a bigger chicken parm.,5
"Started off with the yellowtail crudo which was good but not anything spectacular, then proceeded to order the corn gnudi which i must say was EXCELLENT and the best dish of the night. Ordered the chicken parm which got rave reviews via yelp but sadly wasnt all that great, I just felt it was lacking in sauce and flavor. We also ordered the corn creme brulee side which tasted more like dessert than a side and I love corn but it was a bit too sweet for my liking. For dessert we ended with the chocolate and olive oil cake which again was a disappointment, was a bit on the dry side and i expected more of a chocolate flavoring, :(. All in all only one dish out of 4 really stood out & not sure this place is all its cracked up to be.",4
the chix parm was the best ever !!!!!!,4
We went to celebrate a birthday. The staff made it a fantastic memorable experience. We were treated like old froends. The food was great. An amazing experience. We were so happy that we returned the next morning to enjoy brunch.,4
Wait staff had an extremely poor attitude. Very rude.,5
"Fantastic gem of a restaurant in NYC, amazing food, flavours and tastes gorgeous and attention to detail is excellent, staff extremely friendly and defo worth a second, third and fourth visit!!",5
Great food and Very accomadating service!!,3
"The food was fantastic and there is something for everyone. Great steaks, but real options if you don't want one too. We had an outstanding waiter that made great recommendations. He was on top of everything without being pushy. It was an overall wonderful experience.",3
We went for a birthday & it was great...,4
"Food was great. This is an Italian steak house, so don't come for the pasta menu as it is not comprehensive. However, the two pasta dished that we had and loved were a pasta with fresh truffles that the chef grated at the table as well as a spicy lobster pasta that blem me away.",5
"On the steak side, order the bone in filet. Very tasty!",1
We had a great waiter named Jessie that made us laugh. Worth asking for him.,3
"We were the first table to be seated at 11 am on Saturday. It's on the second floor, so there is a nice steet view. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and attentive. It was not crowded, so it was quiet and relaxing. Decor was warm with a turn of the century vibe. Very good Bloody Mary's.",5
"Had a great dinner here, they plow you to bring your own wine too which is great! (reasonable cork fee). The bone in filet we had was amazing as was the veal shank for 2. The porterhouse agnolotti was also very good! But noting was better than the corn brûlée side, it is SO GOOD. Will definitely be back!",4
We ordered salads to start and enjoy a leisurely meal.. everything came out at once.. Hate that.. food was great but need to time it better. Waitress never apologized.. said we should of said it in the beginning... seriously! I definitely go back and try again.,2
Solid addition to a competitive area. Great wine list,5
Everything was phenomenal... They screwed up the steak I ordered. Have me bone in strip instead of filet but luckily had unbelievable sides to keep me preoccupied with. Corn Creme brûlée and kale carbonara were unreal..,5
"The food was delicous! The restaurant is beautiful and very romantic; perfect for a date night or special occasion. The service stunk though. Our waiter was slow in getting to us and we waited forever for the check. He was a bit ""snooty"" which puts people on edge. He let us know he had been ""doing this for 40 years""; it may be time to find another profession. We sat for a good 10-15 minutes once our dessert was done before getting the check. And the only reason we got it was because my husband flagged someone down. The waiter just kept walking by us and not even looking our way.",4
Everything we ordered was incredible. The artichoke macaroni and corn creme brûlée were so so good. Loved the eggplant balls.,4
Our server was super flakey (they forgot to include a napkin with my place setting and 40 minutes and two reminders later she brought me one.,1
What a lovely meal,5
Terrible organization when assigning tables. Why make a reservation if your table will be an hour late.,3
From the welcome to the service- john  Carlos  was fabulous- helpful- perfect ,5
And the food was special— fabulous Cesear Salad — and the chicken Parm- Pizza?! Was amazing.,2
Will absolutely recommend and we will be back!,5
This was our best meal in New York. The steak was cooked to perfection and the gelato was sensational. It was definitely worth the price. Amazing service and perfect for a special occasion. An absolute must in New York.,4
"Found a hair in my food, kind of killed my appetite. Didn’t tell anyone about what happen, didn’t want to make a scene",5
Everything was amazing from the appetizer (ricotta) to the lobster rigatoni and especially the corn creme brûlée. A phenomenal culinary experience.,4
"We had a VERY bad experience with the man at the front desk upstairs! He did not know our guests had checked in downstairs and were waiting for us at the bar, and he refused to seat us thinking we weren’t all in the restaurant (we hadn’t spotted our guests yet, but they told the downstairs desk!)! He was exceedingly rude and threatened to throw us out of the restaurant cause we wanted to be seated after a long day of burying my mother in law!",3
Great Food.  Great Service.  Great Location.  Highly recommended.,5
Ordered steak. Would rather have gone to Ruth’s Chris. Perhaps I should have ordered something Italian.,4
"Food was very good, waiter was knowledgeable about the wine list and recommended a great bottle. Only one complaint; at 5:30 on a Sunday with the place nearly filled they initially seated us right next to the servers station. Not sure if it’s because we’re both female or that we made the reservation through open table. My friend takes clients there on a regular basis and maybe we could have been taken to a nicer table. The host did move us to another OK table; not great",3
"The food and service were top notch. If you like noisy, which most places in NYC are, then this is the place!  However, there was a table with parents and3 children next to us. The two girls were quiet but the boy was nosier than the restaurant and the parents seemed oblivious to him and totally ignored him! Why would you take your 8 year old to place to a nice place like Quality Italian in the first place? There are plenty of family places in NYC! Let adults be with other adults! Despite that, I would definitely recommend this restaurant and we look forward to going back.",1
"great service, everything we were served was excellent.  i wanted to be in the in main dining room, the room in the back is nice but not what we expected.",5
I have been to QI many times. Things seemed to be off this time. Service was stiff and mundane from bar to host to waiter. The Tomahawk streak was small. I was disappointed. I have been to QI many times. Things seemed to be off this time. Service was stiff and mundane from bar to host to waiter. The Tomahawk streak was small. I was disappointed.,3
"I requested for a good table for a business dinner.  They first made us wait at least for 30 min.  Then they took us in a back room right next to the server station.  With all the noise and the frenic activities of all the servers constant comings and goings it was impossible to have any decent conversation let alone business discussion.  Then later after all other patrons left, they converted the room into a private wine tasting function and put the wine buckets right next to our table!  At least 40-50 people invaded the room and visited the wine station right next to our table as frequently as they pleased.  Really??#!",5
"This restaurant sucks.  I will never go back.  Besides, I am a trained chef in my previous life that I have a palate that can detect mediocre ingredients even if they try to hide with their unidentifiable 'fusion' sauces.  Ugh!  What a waste of the time and money!  My business partners formed the same opinion and they would never go back either.",5
"Nice restaurant and bar, but the food was unseasoned.  Even the sauce put on my dover sole (pricey) was unseasoned. Also just a pat of butter would have made a huge difference in both the fish and the sauce. It lacked body and the flavors didn’t come together.  Same with the rigatoni and lobster.  There was no salt and pepper at all.",3
"Popular local restuarant, menu selection could be enhanced, food was good but I found it to be extremely pricey, even for New York. I think they should have some less expensive, smaller portioned options. Service was very good, but we did have to wait 15 minutes even though we had a reservation.",3
Chicken Parm Pizza,5
Great food. Great service. Great atmosphere.,5
It was so loud it took a lot of the fun out the evening. We had 20 years olds in our group and even they hated the noise. Many better places where you can hear yourselves versus those around you.,3
Lugar agradable pero una carta muy corta aunque buena calidad.,5
Their porterhouse agnolotti is out of this world! Their bread is to die for! Service is excellent and attentive and everything is delicious!,4
Food is amazing.  Best Canollis I've ever had.  The chicken parm pizza and corn brulee are a must.  Staff is very attentive and pleasant and professional.,4
"I'm Italian.  But the food here isn't.  Ok, for those who lack palate, but for those who expect to pay well for authenticity, you'll come home disappointed.  Sorry, but this isn't Italian.",3
a real professional service supported by good food,5
Everything was going great until we had to send back my wife's meal back ..  waiter was extremely understanding and rushed out a substitute meal to replace her fish and that was just okay .. my meal was a 10 and desert was also a 10 ..,5
Tables too close. Needs sound dampening; too loud; two people must shout to converse.  Steak quality is NYC steakhouse average.  Perfectly cooked.  Sides too highly flavored.,5
"I expected better because of how much I had heard about it , may return again to see if it was an off night",5
"Of course a great meal! Our waiter was very funny, have a feeling he was newer to the team because he was not so certain on every dish. Regardless, if you are that much of a critic you are honestly a loser. Fun time!",1
"Amazing place for a million reasons, do your self a favor and don't miss out a dinner. Best Caesar salad in NYC!!",3
We loved our dinner. Everything was delicious and the service was amazing!,5
Great food and atmosphere!!,5
Simply fantastic food! And I’m of Italian decent which is saying something. Well done.,5
"The restaurant was very dark but the service ans food was great. My least favorite dish was the white truffle pasta, so that us saying something!",4
"First time at this restaurant for a business lunch.  The food was delicious! service was good and staff friendly;  we shared an appetizer of Shrimp cocktail and it was four of us and let me say that it was plenty - a large portion. I had one of the Chopped Salad (Spinach) with chicken and it came with blue cheese, nuts artichoke and it was tasty - not your typical salad.  my colleagues had steak, hamburger and chopped salad with beef and their food was also well prepared and delicious!  very large, spread out space.  Excellent for a business meeting/lunch...we are definitely coming back and I highly recommend it.",4
Consistently one of the best restaurants in Manhattan.,5
They strive to accommodate and the space is pretty cool,4
Made us wait 45 minutes past the reservation seems a bit excessive.,4
Vibrant and busy restaurant. Fairly spacious and great place for large parties. Portions are nice and generous but we were not crazy about the special chicken parm 😔,5
"One of the best places in midtown for a fun and lively Client dinner. Food, cocktails and drinks were EXCELLENT.",4
"Normal great food and service. Quality Italian is always at a high level of food, service and ambiance. Server realizes the importance of attentive service during a business meeting but not intrusive service to the discussion. Well done.",5
"Food is spectacular and our server knew just how to put our meal together when we couldn’t decide. Great location, great ambiance and fresh delicious cocktails too!! We love Quality Italian!!",5
Had a really good meal at this italian steakhouse   Excellent service a little noisy. Best off ordering steak. Chicken parm good but not amazing.,4
"Service was ""spotty"" i.e., never saw a waiter between courses, main course placed without silverware, and just not around.  Maybe they had too many tables!   Food was spot on as always!",5
The lamb was Phenomenal. Victoria was the best. The desserts were to die for. Can’t wait to come back.,5
Another great meal!  Food is always delicious!,3
We had the chicken parm pizza it was way over priced and the cheese was over cooked. The place was so loud and the wait was long even with reservations,5
Food was amazing! Get the chicken parm pizza and corn creme brulee.,5
"Love this sister restaurant to Quality Meats. Diversified menu, great service and a happening vibe ! A little noisy, but after a couple of drinks, who cares ! So much fun, always order the spicy pasta...fabulous !",4
It was a wonderful experience. They even gave a complimentary dessert for my husband’s birthday without our asking.,5
"A disaster.   After waiting over an hour for our food, there was a frenetic panic ultimately ending with our food coming out in waves.   Much of it cold.   The wait staff and manager did not seem to care much.  They finally and begrudgingly apologized and said there would be no bill.   This place used to be a favorite.  Now, with two bad outings in a row, we will stay away.",4
"Trendy decor, a bit loud, food good, service not  so much.",1
"I live in Ohio, go to Quality Italian every time I'm in the NYC.  My wife and I's favorite restaurant in the world.",5
"Quality Italian was a great spot for a birthday for my boyfriend and I. We did the porterhouse for two, which was perfectly cooked. The service was outstanding and while the restaurant is very loud, we were seated in an intimate corner and had a great view of the restaurant. I love the fact that the restaurant is on the second floor and the huge windows to look out of. Highly recommended.",3
Very good just incredibly noisy. Could not talk because so loud.,5
One of the worst NYC dining experiences I have had ,5
Bait and switch ...Literally $80 for a chicken farm pizza ..didnt know they charge everyone at the table when you order it for a single person,4
"We love Quality Italian! We celebrate every anniversary and relationship related occasion with you all and you never cease to make it even more special each time. The only thing is that when we sit at the tables when you walk in directly to the right, they are very long for just two people and it is quite hard to hear one another in conversation. Other than that, every trip to the restaurant is perfect!",5
Very pleased with the overall experience. Service was great and the food was delicious. Great ambience.,5
amazing steak- the Porterhouse for two should not be missed.,5
Excellent service,4
"This place has always been my favorite. I love the service, its wine recommendation, and not to mention the steak.",4
Noisy but great flavours .. ate at the bar ..,5
Excellent dinner as usual. Chicken parm was great. Corn creme  brûlée outstanding as were the appetizers and dessert. Noise level very high. Service excellent.,5
"Restaurant went above and beyond to help us celebrate our anniversary .  Service was amazing , our waiter made great recommendations ",3
Thank you for making our night so special!,3
Chicken Parm pizza is a great idea.,5
Loved the monogrammed napkins and sesame focaccia.,5
Canoli cart was delightful!,5
We went to the Quality Italian to celebrate the NYC 2017 marathon including 2 runners and wife of one of us. We have ordered 2 salads with side meats and sirloin (btw the online menu is different from what we got in a restaurant). All meets were overloaded with pepper and salted. My steak was overcooked to medium instead of ordered medium-rare (this is typical for US). The side dishes we got for the table included home fries and broccoli were covered with oil and salt.,3
"Restaurant staff was ""making a show"" by preparing the meet sauce by the table, but in overall atmosphere and level of the food is was overkill.",5
"Terrible service, the food was good but the service was slow and terrible, I would never repeat or recommend this restaurant",5
Great place to get fresh pasta in midtown. Expense account ish but cozy at the same time. Fine for older kids.,2
Special Brunch for Family Celebration,4
Attentive service and thoughtful recommendations. Delicious food and presentation. Would definitively recommend and will return and not just for a special occasion.,5
Food and service was great. Seated on time. We had the steak for two. Very tender and a large portion. The tableside steak sauce is wonderful. The corn crème brule is not to be missed.,5
Some of our meals were overcooked. Didn't complain or send it back as we were going to a show after the dinner.,4
We always go here everytime we go to nyc!  Love it!!,3
Always one of the best restaurants in NYC.,5
"I have eaten at Quality Meats before and LOVED it. I thought Quality Italian was good but not great. We had the crudo and although good, I've had better. I thought the service was outstanding. The Chicken Parm was interesting.",3
Simply Perfect. Loved eveyrthing about this place!,5
"Excellent dining experince from the pre-meal drinks in the bar, to a great dinner sitting at a table overlooking 6th avenue. Our waiter, Michael, was wonderful. Super advice on the wine choices, appetizers and main courses. Resturant decor is delightful and we liked being up a floor and off the street.",5
"High quality of food, service, AND design.",4
"I had heard a lot about this place and although it was very hyped up, it lived up to expectations. The service was great, impressive wine list, and all the food was very fresh and delicious.",5
Really nice rendition of a steakhouse with an Italian accent. Beautiful and well designed 2nd floor space. Went for lunch and prices of both food and wine were reasonable. Three different steaks from rare to well done all were cooked to perfection.. Excellent service but a bit rushed at the end.,5
"Real Quality Food, excellant wine. Great expericence.",5
The food was fantastic sides were amazing staff was extremely fun helpful energetic. I recommend the tomahawk steak.,5
"Outstanding food and service. The homemade sausage was tasty and the cocktails were fresh and vibrant. The chicken Parmesan is incredible. Definitely, want to visit this again.",5
Chicken parm and corn creme brulee side dish were great. Very helpful service.,5
"We often go the the original ""quality meat"", so my husband and I wanted to try this new restaurant ""Italian quality meat"" trusting in the fact it belonged to same company. It has been very very negative experience. We waited a hour for food. The food was completaly soak of garlic and moreover burnt garlic. Nothing can be worst! We asked to waiter about so much garlic and he replayed "" this is Italian cousins"". Unfortunately for him we are Italians and we know about our cousine! So at the end of the day we will never book again at Italian quality meat. This is not an itali restaurant and not an American one. What is that?",1
Service is slow and food is just ok. I always eat at Trattoria Dell'Arte down the block but gave this place a shot but I will be going back to Trattoria Dell'Arte much better food and the waiters are better.,2
Not a whole lot Italian and more of a steak house with a few Italian indredians. I had a great veal chop and my wife had the lamb and both were very good.,4
"Even better than Quality Meat. Where most steak houses doing Italian go too heavy, this was subtle. Clams with an Italian flair, Porterhouse ravioli done incredibly. The steak was the great steak of across the street and the lamb chops were a delicious rack. All in all a great meal.",5
"Only negative is like Quality Meat no managers roam to handle floor issues, and server had too many table too handle although he was excellent when there but couldn't magically split himself into two to properly service table",2
"The food at Quality Italian was quite good, but the noise level was unbearable. It's clearly a place for financial types who want to order expensive wines and scream at each other.",5
"Excellent meal.  Had heard great things about Marea, so we had high expectations.  It didn't let us down.  Each dish was excellent, great presentation, service was excellent",5
The food I ordered was delicious and the service was wonderful. The waiter was very conscientious about my diet restrictions. I think it was a little pricy for the 2 course lunch and the wines by the glass were limited and overpriced.,4
Good was very average.,3
Eating at the Marea was a dining experience I will never forget.,5
"The dinner here was really amazing.  We did the chef tasting menu and everything we had and shared was delicious.  Perfectly cooked pasta, fish (spigola), and octopus.  Desserts were also fantastic.",5
"Great value for 2 stars. No amuse bouche or any extras for the seafood set menu though, a bit surprised.",5
foods are good,5
They offered brunch with no brunch options just regular menu,4
"Celebrated our anniversary and my wife’s birthday. Had the tuna tartare, fusilli, and shrimp gnocchi. Absolutely delicious. The thing that out it over the top was the three amazing desserts (we ordered one and they surprised us with two others for bday/anniv). We had a table looking out at Central Park. Just great all around.",5
Perfect weekend dining out place,5
"Excelente servicio, exquisita la comida, un lugar para disfrutar de una buena cena. Elegante y tranquilo.",5
"Celebrated an anniversary here for the second year in a row. Highly recommend Marea for an occasion, lunch or dinner with a group. The service is always spot on and lovely. The location could not be more New York, right on central parks and steps from Columbus Circle. And then there’s the food.....it’s one of my absolutely favorite meals. If seafood and Italian are your thing then Marea is for you. Share plates to start, order a pasta for yourself and an entree. Do not miss the lobster burrata caprese. Best bite of our trip.",5
"Awesome food, first class service, excellent wine.",5
Elegantly energetic atmosphere with a creative and delectable menu; fresh fish and homemade pastas are the specialties; top notch service--request Darnell--she is delightful!,5
Wonderful high quality food. Delicious bread.  Lovely decor. Expensive but worth it. Busy and lively but appreciated that We could talk to each other without screaming. Highly recommend.,5
Marea was absolutely incredible. Great service and even better food.,5
"Wonderful meal incredibly fresh ingredients, unique menu, very pricey, great if you have an expense account to charge it to or for special occasions",5
The best pasta in the town. Great restaurant. ,4
Very good bread and banbolony,3
You must ask if your tolerance of spice is not unconditional.  This is a lovely very expensive restaurant.  My friend and I chose the same main course so I can not evaluate many options.,2
It is a nice place and if you order carefully you can be very happy.,5
"Perhaps it was because we were seated in the far back area between two large tables of business dinner guests but we felt forgotten and neglected as we had to ask for everything from bread to water as the staff constantly swept through the main dining room and rarely came to our section. Not to mention the wait time between the second and third course was exceedingly long and the final wait to have the check delivered to the table was ridiculous. Yes, the food was good but with such subpar service it didn't leave a lasting impression and at the high price point, we really could never whole heartedly recommend Marea as a exceptional dining experience. It all comes down to lack of service and hospitality. Save your money... go to Gramercy Tavern or Gotham Bar and Grill where it is perfection from the minute you walk in the door until you leave.",1
The prix fixe is a great deal. The food is superb. The fish at Marea  is the freshest and the preparation is delicious. We shared the Bronzino for two. It was amazing. It came with a variety of dipping sauces which were great with the fish. A perfect dinner and perfect night out.,5
second time for me to be in Marea.,5
This time the level of the food was poor. We had fish for main dish - poor...,5
We had a wonderful birthday celebration at Marea. The food was phenomenal and the tasting menu and service were impressive,5
This is our third time in Marea and we enjoyed more everytime. You just can’t go wrong with this Italian Restautant in the city which is becoming a classic.,4
Fabulous as always! When we are in NYC we try to get to Marea every time - a favorite family spot for those of us from out of town and those that live in NYC.,5
"One of the best dining nights we've had.  The staff to the food to the scene are all AMAZING!!  Our server, Ken was INCREDIBLE!! If you can request him I would.  His recommendations were spot on.  He was super attentive and helpful.  The rest of the staff was also super helpful.  ",5
The food was INCREDIBLE.  I am so happy we finally made it to dinner at Marea.,4
"We had a very good meal at Marea, but considering the ratings and cost, we left a little underwhelmed.  We dined at a much less expensive one star Michelin the night before and had a flawless meal, but this restaurant had a mix of perfect and flawed dishes.  ",5
Service,5
"Was flawless.  Our table was perfectly attended by our waitress, somm, and bus service. ",5
Drink,4
Somm recommended a great red at a reasonable cost.  The pear vodka mixed drink we ordered was perfect.  ,5
Food,2
I wouldn't recommend this restaurant.  I did not care for the quality of the food.,4
"Professional, perfect. Corn brûlée alone is reason to go",5
Great food. Service was prompt and excellent. Everyone was extremely friendly.,5
very pleasantly surprised. service and food were definitely top notch! all four in my party were blown away. special bonus: the view of the first snow of the season from the second floor dining room--absolutely beautiful!,4
"When first arrived at our table, we felt a little unattended too. It took a little long for the waiter to come back and take our order after bringing water to our table. Service did improve however so I left feeling better than I did when I first arrived.",4
"Their complementary bread was soft, warm and delicious, I also loved my entrée -the pasta and sauce was fresh and flavorful. My friend's steak was overdone and the homemade steak sauce was under seasoned (had no distinct flavor). She enjoyed the fries and the Cesar Salad.",5
"Over all, we will definitely keep this in mind for the future.",4
Pricey but well worth it. The wait staff was very attentive. The food was fresh and delicious!,5
Not many restaurants can deliver this type of outstanding experience.,4
"With an abundance of steak/Italian in midtown, this really does stand out. Food and atmosphere are great, but does clear out on the early-ish side mid-week. When I say early, I mean by 10:00 the vibe inside the restaurant dies down considerably. Service was a bit off, but food makes up for it.",2
"We traveled into the city for a Thursday evening show and decided to trek a few blocks north for dinner, instead of a quick meal on restaurant row. Glad we did! Food was very good, steak was outstanding and so was the service. Aps, dinner, wine and desert for two, including tip, came in under $200. We' ll be back.",5
Quality Italian has been booked for months since they opened. I was excited to make a reservation for 4 at 8pm on a Tuesday. We arrived at 7:30 and had a few drinks at the bar. It wasn't until 9:15 that we were seated. The staff was apologetic and we quickly forgot how hungry we were. The food was excellent and creative. Our waiter brought us complimentary pasta and dessert since we waited so long. We cannot wait to go back for another delicious meal.,3
The host had no idea what she was doing. They were overbooked and had no idea how to manage the patiently aggravated waiting customers. Finally after we pressed them over and over to get seated they have us a decent table with apologies.,4
"We probably won't return any time soon. Too bad, the food was actually quite delicious.",5
food was excellent - everything about my experience was great and I already told friends about it and they have reservations for next week and I would definitely go back,2
"The chicken Parm is not as good as I get in many neighborhood Italian joints, don;t bother. The porkchop was very good , the veal Milanese not so much. The menu is verey heavy on steak but they already have Quality Meats whci is really good. I might go back, not bad but could be better.",4
"The Name is misleading. This is a steakhouse, not an Italian restaurant. They do have a great selection of food that was very well prepared. The veal chop is outstanding but my Toahawk steak was just OK.",5
"No complaints about this restaurant. Food is fabulous, especially the sausage bread as an appetizer.",5
"Try the branzino, the best fish I've ever had.",5
"I took my family here for lunch. I was inspired by the recent NYT review which gave the restaraunt only one star, but the presentation sounded like fun. Disappointingly for me, during lunch, nothing is prepared table side. Attractive restaraunt. Good service. But the food was mediocre. You could do better going elsewhere.",5
"We ate Thanksgiving lunch at QI. It was the dinner menu. Entrees range fro $28-50+. The grilled octopus appetizer was perfectly cooked. The small ravioli stuffed with minced porterhouse was very delicious. The balsamic glazed filet with crisp bone marrow was extremely tender and flavorful. If you like the brown liquors, don't miss the midtown! Very nice wine list. We shared the construct your own zeppoli dessert, a tasty finish. Our meal for two with one midtown and two glasses of napa cab and two cappuccinos came to just shy of $200 including tip. The wait staff was lovely, attentive and not intrusive. Chef Tacinelli knows his food.",5
"I am a frequent Quality Meats customer, so I decided to finally give Quality Italian a go. It was awesome! I'd suggest not going here on a diet - bc everything makes you about 5 lbs heavier. Totally worth it though :) We had the lobster dish (forgot the name), but they flambé it table side and you can make it as spicy as you like. We also had the huge chicken parm pizza....which was mouth watering. I will definitely be back, but I'll make sure I have the gym on my schedule that next morning.",4
"This is my second time at Quality Italian and it doesn't disappoint. We split the Lobster cocktail which was a generous portion and displayed beautifully. I ordered the far diavolo lobster roll, which came with delicious thick-cut fries. Loved every bite! We also sampled the amazing corn brûlée. Others had the burger and the corn gnudi and raved about them. After having brunch here a few weeks ago, I decided to invite some clients there for a lunch meeting. It was the perfect environment and everyone was very happy with the food and pacing of the meal! Scott was even nice enough to come out from the kitchen and greet us… despite just slaving through a 50-person large party!!! Very impressive and I can't wait to return for dinner!",4
"If you're looking for creative menu options and attentive service, Quality Italian is the place to go. The chefs prepare traditional cuts of meat as entrees, which are complemented by unique appetizers, sides (such as corn creme brulee and kale carbornara -- yum!!), small plates and desserts (waiters stuff cannolis with a variety of flavors before your eyes at a tableside station). I would highly recommend this restaurant and am eager to return!",5
First time,5
"Flawless dishes were mixed with underwhelming dishes.  The apps (grilled Polopo and Cannestrelli) were perfect.  The oxtail pasta was perfect, but the squid ink pasta was heavily over-salted.  Our entrees were split - the Halibut was perfect - the black sea bass arrived a little cold, had an orange sauce that was extraordinarily bitter, and too much anise seed made the dish taste like licorice.  In retrospect, I wish I had said something and sent it back.  Dessert was very good but portions were a little too big (and I can eat a lot!).",3
The best plate of pasta I’ve ever had. It’s got 2 stars for a reason and the service was beyond what you would expect for the price.,2
"Absolutely amazing. The food was great, service was great. Had a great time there!",5
"Loved my lunch - had heard about this restaurant for months.  Loved the casual yet very elegant and professional service, and great food.  It was the perfect spot for the meeting I had there.  I was very happy with everything about it.",5
Impeccable service and great and refined food yet simple. The best combination !,5
This is one of the great gastronomic gems of New York and consistently lives up to its own stellar level of experience.,5
Very high quality hand made pastas. Impressive menu with plenty of seafood options that are extremely fresh.,5
stellar in every possible way.  exquisitely delish.,5
Wow what a treat. It was my parents’ first Michelin and finest fine dining experience and they can’t stop talking about how perfect everything was. ,5
"Tami and the rest of the staff, front and back, were great. ",2
Thank you.,5
"Appetizers were tasty but half of them were minuscule and severely overpriced for the portion, the entree were tasteless and homemade pasta so average. The service was condescending, disinterested , never asking how was the food as an example of the lack of concern, even upon paying the bill there was disinterest as to how we liked the meal and experience.",4
"Such a beautiful place ! Great location! Delicious menu ! I had tuna , octopus and sea bass for my enter . Love it !!!",5
Good choice for seafood with reasonably priced selections on the wine list. Missing some of the presentation flair one might at some of the other marquis NYC restaurants.,5
Absolutely fabulous,5
Some of the best food I have ever eaten.,4
Our experience was fantastic. The restaurant was beautiful and the service was beyond exceptional. The food was fabulous. We have dined all over the world and it was definitely in our top favorite restaurants for dining.,5
"the noodle is a little salty, but the lobster is pretty good to try. good service as well",5
La verdad que una excelente opción para comer Frente al Central Park. Costo - benefició más que sobresaliente.,5
Súper recomendable para aquellos que piensen que esto es para unos pocos..,5
Visiting NYC fir a biz conference,5
As always the food and service are outstanding,5
"Marea is a stunning restaurant with truly amazing food and an impressive wine list! The service is some of the best you will experience in the city and  just steps from Central Park. Make a reservation, you’ll be glad you did!",3
"The food was absolutely amazing - pastas delicious as were appetizers.  If you want it to be ""affordable,"" need to watch what you order a bit... but absolutely doable.  Next time would request to be in the main room.  Great drinks - expensive wine though.  Definitely will put it on my special occasion/client dinner list... fab food.",5
"Amazing pasta, and they would do half the portion! Their Tiramisù version is to die for! The new appetizer they recently got on the menu - stuffed cabbage  - is amazingly delicious, all the ingredients go so well together. It’s a place where you want to come for  real food, not the pretentious presentation that so many famous restaurants are notorious for nowadays.",5
"The food was fantastic, living up to expectations, but the service was very disappointing particularly given the restaurant's reputation, to say nothing about the prices.  When we arrived at 5:30 for a pre-show dinner, there was an army of staff lined up near the entry and nearly every table was empty.  For some reason, however, it took over 10 minutes before anyone came to our table to ask if we would like a drink.  Our aloof server would have been adequate for a middle-of-the-road steak house, but her casual approach and inattentiveness was very disappointing for a Michelin star restaurant.  We informed the host when we arrived that we needed to leave for a show by 7:30, but found ourselves searching for the waitress at 7:20 to clear our entree plates and bring the check (we had to pass on the desert included in the prix fixe dinner). Time for Michelin to take another look at Marea.",4
Marea is consistently consistent as one of the top restaurants in NYC.,5
Another superb dinner and service.  We have celebrated here for our special occasions many times and never been disappointed.  This is one of the best in NYC.,5
Fantastic!!,5
Excellent!!,4
Amazing food. One of best restaurants that i have ever been too. Cant wait to come back.,5
Really good!,5
"Fabulous food,  immaculately presented Italian classics in a lovely elegant environment opposite Central Park. Certainly not a cheap night out but well worth it for a special occasion. Seafood amazing! Appetiser prawns, pasta and scallop mains were the highlight and the desserts fantastic. The fixed price 4 course menu is a perfect choice",3
Celebrating a promotion.,1
Always enjoy the vibes and the food at Marea - never had a bad meal.  The ambience is wonderful and the food is sublime - I will go back again and again!,5
Great Lunch! Food was good. Atmosphere was very nice. Good service. I would go back anytime.,4
"We had a delicious meal that was more typical of a steak house than an Italian restaurant. There were some Italian items on the menu but the steaks and sea food sounded more interesting. Just wish the sides were a little less expensive. $12 for fries seems a little out of line. Service was friendly and professional. Also, tables were a little small to fit our steak for two and sides.",5
"Arrived on time (8:45) - table isnt ready & it happens but it should come with a phony apology & an ETA. Stood around for 15 minutes, decided to ask for our coats so we can have a smoke outside so when inquiring about an ETA - it was met with disdain. This was all fine as I also work in F&B & deeply despise people. I still feel a better effort should be made to conceal such contempt & I try to work on it everyday with my staff. Though it was nice to see Michael White in the house on a Friday night.",5
"We both opted for the 4 course menu & we also decided to add two addt’l crudos, an order of crostini to start & a few langoustines with the main courses. Crudi & antipasti were beautiful. But the fusilli was having a bad day so I didnt touch it - which in turn coincided with the oddest lapse of service I’ve ever witnessed here. The dish sat in front of me for 25 minutes until George our server finally checked in. How many different employees walked by me and said nothing? Alot of runners, servers, sommeliers and guys in suits who check in on tables. No worries, it happens & George made things right. But it left a weird taste in my mouth because of the strange behavior of the host & Maitr’d. ",5
"The take away I always get from Marea is that it’s the type of place where you drop 7 or 8 hundo & you dont feel cheated on food. You just feel the difference between places like this & Le Bernadin. They are in a different stratosphere in terms of service. Marea has no class. You dont have to flag backwaiters for bread, they will serve you whatever glass type you prefer with the champagne & you will never feel like you are doing someone a favor. You will never sit with an untouched dish. You dont care about that stuff at Blue Ribbon - the expectation is set by the restaurant itself. I know diners have a sense of entightlement & that only grows when the spot is bearing two Michelin stars but this doesnt change the little things. The ones that add up and make it all worth while.",4
"What a disappointment.  We were sat down next to a piece of furniture that housed silverware.  The entire night the wait staff were opening and closing the draw and all we heard was the continual clanking of silverware.  The final straw came when the wait staff brought over a huge tray of silverware to put in the draw.  To top it off, there was an extremely bright lamp sitting on top which totally destroyed the mood.  The wait staff would linger and chat while they got the silverware for their tables. Ironically, we had to ask for silverware for our table.  When we complained to the general manager he was rude and had an attitude. First he acknowledged it wasn't a good table and we should have asked to move.  Really!!!!  When addressed again, he actually stated that people request our table.  (hehehe)  General Manager left such a bad taste that we will never return.  Great food, very poorly managed!!!!!!!!!!!!",5
Always perfect every visit — love the team here.,2
Loved everything about Marea. Had s great server named Elizabeth. Bonus was having Bono and the Edge sitting next to us!,4
The fusilli was excellent and The plate whith burrata was very very good!!!,3
"STK's standards, regrettably, are going downhill. I guess too many outlets dilute the quality of both food and service. Had the prix fixe lunch. I literally had to spit out the half chewed mussels ( appetizer) as they were not so bad ! ( I have mussels every now and then so I know when a resto serves them stale). The server asked if he can give me something else in exchange for that. I requested for a mixed green salad. He went to ask his manager. And guess what? I cant have a salad since it was not a choice in the prix fixe. One would think that for serving stale mussels, the manager should make up for that mishap. No. So on to the main course. Our steaks were overlooked, the kale was droopy and swimming in oil.",3
"I went here for the restaurant week lunch menu. I think they only offer restaurant week deals for lunch. All 3 courses stood out to me. The mussels were large and juicy, prepared in a little bit of a spicy broth, just enough for a kick unless you decided to go ahead and eat the pepper flakes too (like I did), in which case your mouth is left burning just a bit longer. The flat iron steak was prepared exactly as we asked for - medium and medium rare - which is hard to find in a restaurant! The dessert we took back to the office, but still good in the to go box. There was a crispy edge with a fluffy middle of the cake, topped with fresh peaches :)",4
The restaurant week lunch was very limited. Restaurant failed to post restaurant week lunch menu on their website -- had they done so we would not have gone.,2
"We had a great time, but we were not too fond of the rushed service. I understand you have later reservations but this is not the Theatre District and no need to rush to clear plates and ask every 5min.",4
It was so loud that we did not enjoy experience at all. Not a good ambiance for a professional dinner. We complained to the waitress and she completely dismissed us. Will not return.,2
"In my first time here, I had no alcholic beverage; I went simply to be away from the office in a different atmosphere.  The overall decor was very modern, and set to 80's music (a huge plus!!!)  And the food, while it looks a bit different at first, was top notch!!",5
"The second time, I will have some wine to complete my experience here!!",2
"I have been to all other stk locations in the U.S including Las Vegas as well as Beverly hills,absolutely the worst food and in no way did i experience this level of quality at the other locations!..The reputation for this establishment speaks volumes and honestly i am floored .This is NYC the best city on earth! such an embarrassment especially since the price tag should match the quality but in this case it did not what a waste !",4
Just too noisy to be able to enjoy a meal!,5
"The decor was nice-The food was great and there were different types of foods to try-For example the porterhouse ravioli, the creme brulee corn and the eggplant meatballs. The service was also great and friendly-Only complaint I had was that I wanted a 5:30 reservation and only 5:00 was available. There were plenty of tables open at 5:30 that was still open when we left at 6:45. I had tickets to ""Jersey Boys"" at 8 PM and the later reservation would have been more convenient.",4
"Went on a date the other night. It was Friday night and the restaurant was pretty busy. We had a reservation for 9:30pm, however we were not seated until 10:20... which is a bit of a wait. With that being said both the Kale Salad and Chicken Parm were delcious and most definitely worth the wait. I would return.",5
"The food was good. The wine excellent. The service so-so. The prices over the top. The noise level excessive. We ordered a single portion of steak to share and they brought two. I had to request that they reduce the bill (which they did). Sorry, but I would not return. You can have a comparable dinner for 1/3 less, easily.",3
Pretty cool spot. I thought it was too loud and the food was good.,4
"Limited menu especially on the pasta side, for an Italian restaurant",2
"Cool place, great scene and buzz. The place had been pretty well hyped to me before I went, so thought the food was good enough but not worth the hype. The signature chicken parm for two was like eating an Elio's pizza, not what I was expecting.",4
"I don't feel like even writing this but I have to after my experience. In a nutshell: Showed up 5 minutes prior to my reservation and waited 50min for my table, they were giving away complimentary drinks to everyone at the bar bc I wasn't the only one waiting and annoyed. Server did not explain specials(we didn't even have the special list in our menu, had to ask table next to us to take a peek at theirs). Steak tartar was ok, caesar salad was whatever, chicken parm for 2 ?! I rather go to Toni Dinapoli's for half the price. QI fries, a sad sad side with no taste, soggy and oily. Waiter didn't check on us the whole time unless our cocktails were empty. Didn't even bother to sell us on dessert bc of how annoyed we were. Never will be back...",1
"When in NYC, we make it a point to visit one of the restaurants in theQuality Family. Our recent visit was again, as always, just absolutely perfect, a little noisy, but still perfect. Have never had a bad experience at any of the Quality Restaurants.",5
"Not bad. Prefer Quality meats. If you lovebrokers in fleece vests, this your spot.",3
"Quality Italian was incredible - the food was delicious, the crowd/ambience enjoyable, and service was excellent. I would definitely recommend to friends and family.",5
Just an exceptional experience all around.,5
"Absolutely delicious! A huge fan of Quality Meats and this was just as impressive, if not as delicious!",5
Truly the best chicken parm in NYC,5
Wanted to see what all the rave was about.,3
Due to that your expectations are greater. We loved the decor and the vibe the bar had.,5
"Besides that, once the food came. We were not impressed.",4
The food is ok. Many other Italian restaurants have better food at lower price points.,4
I will not be back as this was my second chance after I had visited for brunch.,4
Reservation honored on time,5
Friendliest service and super food,5
"La comida deliciosa, buen servicio pero la espera entre un tiempo y otro fue largo",4
Very good! My bf ordered from the restaurant week menu and I ordered from the regular menu. Cheddar mashed potatoes were amazing!,2
Loudest restaurant I have ever been to. Spent the evening screaming across the table at my dining companions. Overpriced for what it is...steak on a plate. Steak was cooked perfectly thought. Good for cocktails and overpriced steaks if you want to hang out in a place where 3 out of every 4 tables is taken up by groups of guys on an expense account.,2
I was actually very disappointed with STK. Food was okay.. Nothing special..,4
Our waitress was kind and I liked the interior.,5
But I would not return. It was okay for me to dine here once.,3
RESTAURANT WEEK WAS VERY GOOD - DON'T MISS IT ...,4
Please go!! Service is great.. Food was great!!!,1
"This is my second time at STK; I am still not impressed. Went for Restaurant Week. Bread was amazing. PEI Mussels were pretty good, hanger steak was tough, mashed potatoes were very good. Peach dessert was OK. There was a rip in the leather seat, and it was messily fixed with DUCT Tape. What's that about!!!?? And WHY is there techno/disco music playing in the background? Play that music at night. I can't figure this place out. This will be my last time going to STK.",4
Food was delicious as always!!! Would have preferred STK in Meatpacking definitley more of a scene for a Saturday night. STK Midtown is definitly a scene for the after work crowd Tuesdy-Friday because of its location.,4
This is a midtown tourist trap.,2
Over priced / small drinks.,4
solid spot especially for Midtown west...food was above average and the atmosphere was swanky and cool. Highly recommend for going out after work with frieds or a great lunch spot even appropriate for business/client lunches; your client will be impressed with the cool atmosphere...high price points are to be expected so perfect for expense accounts,2
"Depending on the time of day, it can get quite loud. Food is very good and are presented beautifully on the plate. Great for a foodie.",4
I was looking forward to my lunch at STK but was severely disappointed. Had a 12:15 lunch and was told that the lobster roll special was not available. The restaurant was half empty and the special was already finished by 12:30! I ordered a hamburger & fries that were quite greasy. We also had a party of 7 but were seated in a very cramped booth.,5
"Food was exceedingly well prepared, and the service was very attentive without being ""in your face."" We really enjoyed ourselves, and would recommend the experience.",4
"The steak was flavorless and the tuna had a nasty ""fishy"" coating that ruined a nice piece of fish. The Foie Gras french toast was interesting and the mac and cheese was solid but I wouldn't go back as there are many better options for steak in midtown.",3
One of the better steakhouses in NYC. Can't wait to try the meatpacking location.,1
STK in Midtown was great! The food was delicous and the staff are curtious and nice. Love dining there and celebrating special occasion there.,2
"Nice place, staff was great, food was good",4
"Louder than it needed to be early evening on a Friday (and I'm not that old!) The place was mostly empty, but the music and AC were up loud enough for a packed house. Any restauranteur should have known better - think they're just checked out because business is slow, so they're on autopilot.",1
Steaks were mediocre and fish was tiny and mediocre,4
"The food was marginal, the portions small and the prices very high.",2
Great food. Mac n Cheese very good. Apprecicated you could order small and medium portions of steak for lunch (small/med/large at dinner) sides are great to share. Greg and the other wait staff was very attentive. menu is a little limited. We sat at a table in the back (semi circular) and the seating was low which made the tables a high - a little uncomfortable. Otherwise it was a great experience.,5
"Very uncomfortable to have any conversation in this restaurant . Unbearably loud bar scene. Food is nothing extraordinary, service is rushing you out. Waiter did not bring the two desserts we ordered dbefore bringing the bill to push us out. Very expensive for food you can get in any other steakhouse with much more respectful service.",4
the noise level is RIDICULOUS!!!! could not hold a conversation,5
"The food was good, but the server was very pushy, constantly standing around trying to interrupt when we were having a business discussion. This is not a good place for a business dinner as the noise is very loud. Also, the wine list is not as depicted on-line. This is a drinks-only meat market place in my opinion.",3
Scrumptious!!!!!! Beware of the pricey lobster mac and cheese!!!,1
"Totally loved this place. The decor is fantastic and so was the DJ. I had a 3 course meal and I have to say that is was very tasty, plates were worth to take a pictures of because they looked amazing!",4
"Food was unexpectably fantastic! Usually hot tendy places lack in the food dept. , STK was one of the best steaks I ever had!",5
Chicken parm the best!,4
"For the expense account crowd, there's the Tomahawk rib chop, but we had the humble chicken and pork chop and both were exceptional. Wine by the glass was excellent, too, and the service was attentive and friendly. We never felt hurried though the restaurant was full. For after-work meet-and-drink, there's a handsome bar on the first floor. On the second floor, the dining room is elegant but casual, and when it gets close to prime dining time, it's crowded and loud.",3
"The food was exceptional, I had the bone marrow fillet and my date had the tomahawk steak. My only qualm is that the waiter could have been more attentive and welcoming. In no way was he rude but every encounter seemed rushed. He even rushed through explaining what sauce he was making with the fresh herbs at the table. If he walked us through it more to know what concoction he was whipping up, it would have been more of a fine experience.",5
Been wanting to try it for a while and it was worth the wait. The food was really delicious. The ambiance was really nice as well. I would definitely go back soon!,5
always amazing!!!! the chick parmagana was the best ever!!!!!,2
"This place was so good. Quality Meats is one of my fave restaurants so I expected nothing less. Granted we had an early time slot before a show so the attention to our table was possibly better than at a crazy-busy hour, but excellent nonetheless. Food was delicious.",5
"We were lucky to read about Quality Italian Steaks in New York Magazine. The article was on the city's best new restaurants, and we agree. The space itself is unexpected. Once a Staples, it now feels like a high-end industrial loft with countless features adding warmth, notably a wood floor and great lighting. In this comfortable space, with second-story views, a professional staff serves delicious meals. Ours started with fresh-from the oven rolls good enough to tempt any carb-avoiding patron. The entrees (branzino and perfectly prepared steak) and side (broccoli rabe) also were excellent. And, as a manager promised, the desserts are not to be missed. The gelato and olive oil chocolate cake are reason enough for a second visit.",2
"The food was very good except for the Lobster Diavlo. It should have been served out of the shell because all of the sauce landed on the shell which made cracking the lobster quite messy. The menu is slightly challenging with some terms which are not familiar and should be explained without having to ask (there were several). Otherwise, the experience was enjoyable.",3
"My husband and I visited QI on Thursday, and we had the meal of our lives!",2
"This place is the perfect combination of a great steakhouse with a modern twist on Italian classics. The Sausage and Pepper Garlic Toast appetizer was one of the highlights for me; it tasted exactly like a sophisticated version of my mother-in-law's sausage and peppers. Also, the Garganelli Amatriciana and the Balsamic Laquered Filet with bone marrow are incredible.",5
"Service was great, too! Michael was super attentive and knowledgeable, and never made us feel rushed. Thanks to Michael and Roger (GM) for a great dinner!",3
"Have dined twice now, with a third reservation upcoming. Lunch is wonderful on all levels! The food thoughtful and delicious - the chopped salads top notch! Love what they did with the space, and I was dubious as it was formerly an old Staples! The lighting fixtures are gorgeous, I want them at home! Everything we have tried I would have again. Service very professional and kind. YOu feel like you leave the craziness of 57th Street far behind. It is a special place, go!",3
"My Fiancée and I booked this restaurant for NYE as we had previously enjoyed a night at Quality Meats. The decor of old industrial was great but the food was bland and my steak was very chewy, my worst steak since being in the US for 2weeks and I have had a few! The steak sauce made at out table however was excellent and so was the guy serving it but our actual server was not attentive at all, left us waiting to order drinks for 10 minutes and did not even ask how our meal was. I would have complained but when we received the bill it was missing out bottle of wine so it worked out for us anyway.",1
If you want to enjoy one of the Quality restaurants then visit Quality Meats and avoid quality Italian,4
"Went to QI for New Years Eve dinner and was blown away. The service was unreal, everyone we came in contact with was g=fantastic! The food was also some of the best I've had. You have to get the Chick Parm you wont believe your eyes, its awesome.And tastes just as great! Seafood platter was incredible. This place has it going on. Very buttoned up, super friendly staff and fantastic food.",5
"From the oily appetizers to the wait staff uniforms, the on the cheap decor, the fake sommelier and the steak house prices, this is TGIF on steroids. If you leave your salt fear at the door, the porterhouse is very good and the table side made steak sauce is tasty but at $98 for 2 it shoud be. All the hype is about the chicken parm but do you really want to spend $58 on ground chicken and cheese?",4
Great ambiance and great service but the food really fell short for the price. Really wish we skipped the pizza pie-sized chicken parm...it tasted like McDonald's chicken nugget meat...frankly it wasn't even worth half the $58 price tag. Steak tartare appetizer was really tiny and not very flavorful as well. Basically this place is just a big show that looks really nice but the food falls way short of the prices.,4
"thank goodness for our lovely server Thomas, otherwise, the food is mediocre and the place itself is a tourist trap. that said, because of our server we had a great time, but sadly, will not return.",4
"my wife took me here for my birthday and we had an excellent dinner. Our waiter was excellent and cater to your needs and knew that it was my birthday. The food was also outstanding and we have a wide variety of excellent tastings, both in our appetizers and in our main Courses.",2
Not worthy of 2 Michelin stars or price charged. Sister restaurant ai fiori is incomparably better,2
Delicious foods and friendly waiter. Love appetizer most,5
"Aside from the slight pretentiousness of our waitress, the overall dining experience was excellent! The quality and presentation of the food was world class.",5
"We like Michael White restaurants, this one especially. But Marea is very expensive, and we therefore expect a lot, even for the set price weekend lunch (about $60).  That two course weekend lunch now offers only pasta dishes for the second course. Both the one I had and the one my wife had were very good, but not great.  The appetizers were outstanding - octopus for my wife, soup with crisp oysters for me.  Maybe it's best to order 2 appetizers. Unsure that's allowed. We did not ask.",4
"The wine list is extensive, but seriously overpriced - only a few bottles in the $60-90 range, and several of the ones I saw on the list I have bought retail for less than $20.",4
It was a four course dinner.:,5
"The food wasn't great, especially the cream of spinach. The dessert menu lacks and needs to be revamped as soon as possible. The wine selection was great. I chose Reisling and it was a great choice. The ambiance was amazing, middle aged chic styled professionals and 80's type music, including Michael Jackson and Whitney Houston, played by a D.J. The Reisling wine I selected was really nice. The ambiance made up for the quality of food! With good wine and good music, I almost forgot about the food! If you want good food, skip it. If you want good ambiance, this is your home!",5
Firt course- lobster- We do not realize that there were an extra cost to this one (worth- it was  excelent!),4
"Second course - Gnocchi - not fancy, spicy bad pasta!!!No images on this!",4
Third course - scalops wonderful!,5
"Fourth course - pear in wine, and a beautiful ice cream shaped as a pear, but I did not liked the salty flavour...",4
Delicious food! Great ambiance,4
"Have eaten here multiple times.  Signature dishes are still at the top of their game.  However service seems to be slipping which is why I removed a star.  When lunch for four with a low end bottle of wine is over $500,",5
"you expect the service to be impeccable and historically this has been the case.  However on my last visit, it seems to have deteriorated.",2
"The octopus fusilli might be the single best pasta dish I've ever tasted. The restaurant was super crowded on a big tourist weekend, so initial service lagged a bit, but overall was good.",5
"Lovely place and atmosphere, attentive service and super food",4
Great and reliable as always. You really cannot go wrong with this place.,5
Muy buena experiencia. Tal vez podrían adornar mejor el lugar,5
"Truly an exceptional dining experience!! The food was fantastic--we went for the prix fixe menu and were very glad that we each had a chance to taste four courses. We did not order any of the crudo or raw selections but were bowled over by the complex flavors and remarkable combinations of seafood and fish presented in each course. Our waiter, Chris was amazing--the pacing of the meal was superb--it was just an awesome experience!!",5
Excellent from beginning to the end. Food is superb and imaginative. Fusili and Astice are particularly fabulous.,2
"Over priced for food, service eh.  Way better pasta in the city.  Never again. Reviews from open table inaccurate",3
"Everything was great from the food to the service.  Had a reservation and sat us right away, and even knew it was my girlfriends birthday.  The squid ink pasta was amazing, will go back every time I'm in New York",5
Food was awesome. Prices very steep. Mains not bad but cocktails and appetizers way high.,5
Food and services was FABULOUS. This place is really on top of every aspect of the dining experience. When I was greeted by the maitre d he told me my table was ready and reminded me that I requested a table along the wall. The hostess took our coats and was brought to the perfect table. Our server George was excellent and the food AMAZING (delicious). We had leftovers and asked for them to be wrapped up. It never came back; after we received our check we left. As we were given our coats from coatcheck she handed us our doggie bag nicely wrapped. Marea is wonderful and really on top of their game. If you're a foodie -- go!,5
"One of the best restaurant we’ve been to in NY. The service could be a bit better, but the food is awesome. Been here before and definitely will come back again when in NY.",3
"Great food, ambiance and excellent service!  Can't wait to go back!",5
"There are not too many OMG moments we have in our lives, this certainly one the top 10 food moments of our lives!!!",5
Outstanding,5
"Excellent dinner, second time around. Seated promptly at the appointed time, great food, great service.",4
"Definitely one of the best dining experiences I have had for some time, it helped not having to pay!",5
We had a marvelous dinner and a great waiter. Food was wonderful. Ambience is terrific.,5
"My only objection is: I can't understand why a seafood restaurant is using bacon and ham on seafood dishes. While I understand that the dishes can be prepared without the ham if so requested, I found the combinations odd. A terrific experience.",3
As noted the service was not on a par with their other two restaurants which we go to with some frequency,4
"The staff was welcoming, experienced and helpful in our ordering. We went after theatre and there were several appetizers one could order in place of a full meal. Food was delicious and we would definitely recommend the restaurant and return on a future visit to the city.",5
"Superb seafood preparations, creatively prepared and beautifully presented, whether raw or cooked.",5
Staff courteous and attentive.,4
"Decor and atmosphere contemporary, but restrained.",5
"The entire experience that my boyfriend and I had at Marea was spectacular from start to finish. I loved how inviting the space was, not at all stuffy or pretentious. The attentiveness of the staff was just right and every single dish hit the right notes. I truly can't wait to return!",4
"very creative cuisine, deliciously prepared and presented, great service",1
"Service and quality of cuisine were both first rate. Dining was elegant and relaxed. Although menu prices are not cheap, the flavor and presentation of entrees and appetizers makes it worth every penny. The wine list is large with a surprising number of reasonably priced wines on the menu, leading, of course, on up to more expensive and rare vintages. The sommelier was knowledgeable and courteous, and I actually tried--and enjoyed--his suggestion, a Northern Italian red that went very well with scallops and halibut. As we left, we were gifted with a pumpkin loaf for breakfast the following morning. The laof, and memories of a pleasant evening, were savored over coffee the next day.",4
"I've heard so many great things about this place so I had to try it. I took my fiancee here for a special occasion and we both loved it. Food was excellent, service was the same, and the check was even less than I had expected, given the warnings that this restaurant was pretty pricey. It wasn't the remarkable ambience of a Daniel or Gramercy Tavern, but it was pretty decent. Overall, in every aspect, it was very good.",3
"Huge dissapointment. Recent NYT review was far too generous. From the unconfortable seats to sloppy service, the under-seasoned mains and weak desserts, Marea is by far the worst value at the high-end in NYC.",4
The food was very unique and delicious. There were interesting combinations of fish and other Italian specialties.,5
We went for lunch. The food was good but the portions were tiny. They should either have two portion sizes offered or charge more.,3
"The food was superb in taste and presentation. The room is gorgeous and the staff very nice. However, it was a struggle to get my waiter to take the order and present a check. I had to flag the waiter both times. It seemed as though the waiter was not even looking in our direction throughout the meal. It was stressful as one of my guests had a train to catch...",3
Perfection is the word that comes to mind. From food explanations to wine recommendations the experience was flawless.,3
the only negative about this restuarant was the food could have been better for the prices,4
"The service was wildly uneven. Some dishes arrived promptly (nearly on top of one another), but one was nothing that we had ordered. The entree only appeared after a very protracted and inexplicable wait. The server seemed embarrassed but unable to cope, and the maitre d' was frankly chilly and irritated. The food (when it arrived) was uniformly excellent. As a result, the meal was at best a mixed experience.",4
Good for before Opera or Concert.,5
"The ambiance is quiet and romantic without lacking any energy. The food was excellent. The service is so impeccable it borders on stiff, but the service was very efficient, unintrusive and polite.",3
The special Italian beer selection is a real treat.,5
wonderful wonderful wonderful!!!,5
"This is not a three star restaurant. Period. I don't know what the Times reviewer was thinking, or whether he was 'outed' . . . . or what. (On the other hand, this is not the first time we have found the Times food reviews to be unreliable.)",4
"Food was ok, but very uneven in execution and quality. Some dishes were good (e.g., the risotto funghi), but none was outstanding and some were extremely disappointing. Notably bad were the crudo, the sea urchin and lardo and the brodo fish soup.",4
"Service was eager and energetic, but unpolished, forgetful and at times intrusive.",5
Very disappointing food and service. Surprised in a negative way.,4
"Was great, but forgot a special ",5
Engagement  dessert and server was really cold.,3
Excellent service!,5
The best homemade experience in Manhattan. Hand-made pastas.  Freshest seafood.  Desserts without peer.  This is the best understated five star experience in midtown. Period. Service is invisible. A model of fine dining which should be emulated. We have delivered almost 700 reviews in the past 2.5 years on OpenTable.,3
Excellent as always. The fusilli with octopus is a classic.,5
"The service was impeccable — from the moment we stepped into the restaurant to the moment we left. Before we gathered our coats to leave, we were presented with a delicious pumpkin raisin muffin to bring home. The staff were friendly and attentive to our needs. We had the prix fixe option but were able to choose 4 dishes each from almost the entire menu which is a really good bargain. The Zuppa, a lobster butternut squash soup, was memorable and the Spinosini, a pasta served with langoustines and pomodoro sauce is a delight. I was less impressed with dessert (I had the Torrone) but my fiance's was marvelous — he had the Affogato, a drink/dessert with 3 scoops of zabaglione gelato, espresso and amaro. Will certainly come back again! :)",4
"There is potential here but much more work meeds to be done to acheive better execution, better and more consistent quality and a professional service staff.",4
"Stopped in for a quick lunch here, and everything was superb. Lunch pricing is friendly (2 courses for $34, $17 for each additional course). I splurged on the lobster with burrata, eggplant, tomatoes and basil, which was complex, surprising, and quite generous with the lobster (although those funny little basil seeds can get stuck in your teeth). Second course was a pasta with sea urchin and crab, which was beautifully executed, surprisingly spicy, but a little less intensely briny than I might have hoped for. Excellent Greek wine from Santorini by the glass, a little pricy at $16. Very, very good overall.",5
"Pork chop is always the way to go. Our waiter Charlie was awesome 👏 😎sauce attentive, caring & always there when we needed him.",4
Great! Highly recommend!,5
Soooo good! Love this place. Love it more every time I go.,5
"The place is nice, food is okay , service is not that good",4
Quality Italian was a vibrant and energetic restaurant with the food and staff to match.  ,5
My wife and I ended up splitting a large tomahawk ribeye that was perfect for the 2 of us and cooked to perfection. The wait staff made excellent recommendations from both the wine and dinner menu.,5
"All in all, a great night out!",5
Best date ever.,5
Excellent lunch including eggplant meatballs.,4
Very good food.,5
"Service was amazing. And the food was great as well. I personally got the spicy lobster pasta and the fact that they pan fry the lobster with wine right in front table side is amazing. The main dining area is a bit loud; however, there is a back section which is much quieter and easier when talking with others in your party.",4
Wednesday night but still quite a buzz. Our server was excellent. ,2
Wish there were some less expensive bottles of wine.,4
Everything was wonderful from the food to the service. The only suggestion I would have is to lower the music and/or change the genre. I believe the music was hard rock and the bass was a bit overwhelming.,5
Good food not great.  Have been many times for dinner (chicken parm is delish) but lunch was just ok...,5
"First time at this restaurant that came with great recommendations and it did not disappoint.  The setting is casual steakhouse, with plenty of options on the menu for those who are not steak eaters.  Cocktails pre dinner at the bar were well prepared (fever tree tonic our favorite) and the bartender was super helpful with menu tips and advice.",5
"Salads and Hamachi were great to start.  Penne amatriciana was super flavorful with a kick of spice.  Tommahawk ribeye had incredible flavor and a great char.  Branzino, skirt steak, and veal loin marsala were liked by the group.  Definitely a place to go back to, especially with street parking on sundays no problem.",3
"Great experience.  The food and drinks were great, and service was top notch.",5
Make a reservation.,5
"If I could give our server Roberto 10 stars I would!  Made our anniversary extra special!  Food is great - don’t miss the chicken parm!  Great wine list.  On a packed Saturday night, Roberto made us feel like we were the only ones in the restaurant.  We will definitely be back!",4
"Food was delicious, and importantly the service impeccable . Those guys put so much work into making your evening one worth the memories :) def Reccomend! Ps very good  octopus",5
Food was way too expensive for the average taste. Service felt awkward and not particularly attentive.,5
The food was excellent!  Definitely recommend the Baci dessert for 2!,5
Amazing food!,4
"Food took very long to come out but food was great, waiter was nice and they brought several desserts to make it up to us.",5
Excellent dining.  Staff was gracious and very accommodating,2
1.  Corn Creme Brulee.  2.  Brussels sprouts.  3.  Bone in sirloin.  4.  Warm rolls.  5.  Impeccable service.  6.  Warm atmosphere.  7. Did I mention the Corn Creme Brulee?,4
"Great restaurant for business lunch, anniversaries and milestone celebrations.  Food and service are always top notch.",3
"Superb service,excellent porterhouse- cooked as reequested.",5
"Food was amazing. Very very corporate vibe, everyone there is in a suit and coming for an after work drink.",5
"Hostess took nearly 1 hour to seat us, but made up for it with free appetizers, sides and desserts which was very nice. Would go back for the chicken parm and desserts! The ice creams are amazing and all come in sundae form.",3
"Recently visiting New York, we found ourselves looking for something a little different. And, boy, did we luck out.",5
"Quality Italian is a very different kind of restaurant from its industrial looking interior to its varied menu, it is not your traditional “Italian” restaurant; it is so much more.",5
"It started off wonderfully, after being promptly seated for our 7 o’clock reservation, we were greeted by our server, Michael, an outstanding waiter.",5
"Pasta sticked to teeth, and there was no visible meat through I ordered a lobster pasta.",5
"While very good, I’ve had better food at other (one-starred) Michelin-starred restaurants. Still very good for the price. Sitting next to the server’s side station in the middle of the dining area was the biggest down side, very noisy and distracting to hear servers talking and silverware clanging.",4
"Very impressive wine list, and even more impressive dishes. Lobster burrata is an absolute must if it's available -- do NOT skip on this. The infamous braised octopus and bone marrow fusili is to die for. Save this one for special occasions because it's absolutely sure to blow your mind.",5
One word- Overrated,5
Two words: Won't Return,4
Three Words: Del Posto is BETTER,5
Four Words: Don't Waste Your Time,4
The toasted cauliflower was really good. And the ribeye excellent. Loved the Marche Wine.,4
"Nice place, nice food, although the risoto was good, lack on presentation. Service was rude and didn’t make us comfortable, expediting the whole thing throwing out food and wine until the end.",4
Very nice experience.  Staff was friendly and not over done.   Food was wonderful.,4
"Because it was a special occasion and we'd never been to Marea, we did the 8 course tasting menu.",4
"The seafood was excellent, both the oysters and the credo especially. The pasta was very good, but not nearly as good as the earlier courses. The steak was also good, but another small step down.",4
"Stick to the seafood, and you might have the best meal you've ever eaten.",5
Food was very good but service awful. We waited at least 15 minutes for the sommelier to come over and had to ask repeatedly for someone to fill wine glasses or find our waiter. Very disappointing for an expensive restaurant.,3
"Always amazing food, can't go wrong with the pasta and the crudo. Extremely helpful sommelier who provided us with a wonderful recommendation. If you're looking for one of the best dining experiences and the best food that NYC has to offer, this is it.",5
"the restaurants decor is beautiful, the service is outstanding, and the food is very good. A real gem.",4
Excellent service: friendly welcome and a waiter who knew how to be attentive. The food was excellent as well. The only drawback: the price. I thought the portion sizes were ideal for a multi-course dinner but the prices seemed excessive.,5
cotechino and cod belly risotto with red wine reduction is amazing! Also spaghetti with sea urchin and crab equally good.Beautiful selection of wines that pair well with the food.,4
"What a brilliant space, precise kitchen, and thoughtful beverage program! All beautifully served by kind and well-informed professionals. We could have spent hours more indulging in the too-many attractive food ideas.",5
"Marea is currently on a roll -- busy, but eager to please as a result of a recent, very favorable review by the New York Times restaurant critic. The menue is heavily fish focused and includes hard-to-find options such as sea urchin and real Dover sole. Service is friendly and attentive, the extensive wine list includes a commendable number of affordable options and the food we ordered was up to expections. The desserts were standouts -- exceptionally good. The location is very convenient -- the corner of Central Part South and Columbus circle and even with every table occupied, the noise level was low enough to permit easy conversation.",5
my new favorite restaurant in NY. very simple elegant design using contemporary materials. nice sound level(you can converse). amazing food!,5
"A really wonderful meal and an exception to the many Italian restaurants in Manhattan that seem too similar and a little stodgy. The food was light and the flavors worked well together. The crab salad and lobster ravioli were particularly memorable. The service was attentive, patient, and yet not intrusive. Many people in the restaurant appeared to be regulars and I can see why.",5
"I would prefer more non-fish options on the four course menu so that I could be more comfortable inviting non-fish eaters that I know, but as this is a fish restaurant it is not that much of a criticism.",4
Excellent and interesting food in very enjoyable surroundings. They deserve the Michelin star and 3 star NYT review.,4
"Incredible food, and thoughtful service. One of the best meals I've had this year.",4
Great great and great. You should have a chance to experience this.,4
"Exquisite, unusual dishes, done to perfection. Many dishes one does not usually find in an Italian Restaurant",5
"The food overall was pretty fantastic, although my partner's fish was actually somewhat overcooked and a bit hard, which was surprising; like it had been under a heat lamp waiting for the other dish (the fish stew) to be done.",4
"Service was the big let-down: both too much and not enough, nervous and overly fussy.",4
We had four forks added and taken away for dishes that did not require forks. And the woman with the forks and knives literally tried to pry the knife from my partner's hand mid-bite (guess it was the wrong knife!!),3
We had friends pay for our bottle of wine and were presented with a note from them at our table without being told what it meant (that they had paid for the wine.),4
"I started off with a house special cocktail, Agrumi Smash – something with vodka in it. Whatever it was, it was delicious!",5
"Next on to the appetizers. I had the Scallop Crudo, fresh thinly sliced raw scallops, fantastic. My partner had Sausage and Pepper with Garlic Toast, another savory delight.",5
"For our entrees, I had the special Dover Sole, a perfectly delectable preparation – lightly sautéed, cooked perfectly. While my partner also had a home run, the Veal Milanese. A veal chop flattened, breaded and fried. I had a taste, it was exquisite. ",5
" Quality Italian lives up to its name, but not just Italian; quality everything!",4
"The restaurant is noisy, cacaphonous and overly bustling with nonsense.  I think people from Out of Town must think this place is cool or something.  The food was average and the service the same.  We could hardly hold a conversation over the poor acoustics playing dated rock tunes and everyone screaming over the crappy tunes.  The only positive is my martini was huge....PHEW!",4
Fabulous!,5
"I read about Marea in a recent Esquire magazine just before a planned long weekend in New York. Coincidentally, I had already booked an evening for my husband and myself at one of Michael White's (3) restaurants: Convivio. We enjoyed an authentic Italian repast for our first lunch in the city, after a beautiful fall walk in the park. Marea is in a great location, on Central Park South. The foccacia was as good as its Ligurian origins, with flaked sea salt and rosemary. Everything was fresh and presented simply, but elegantly. Service was attentive, and the atmosphere is welcoming, unstuffy, and supports a talented chef's vision.",4
"I was fortunate enough to dine at Marea the evening Sam Sifon's review came out in the Times. Of course, I felt compelled to order nearly everything he had and it was all excellent. The restaurant itself is absolutely beautiful; the service was gracious and professionl (my tiny water glass was always full); and the food was just fantastic! I will recommend this to all of my friends and family--truth to be told, I already have. Thank you!",4
"Chef White has done it again. Excellent food, great service,sophisticated decor and everything you want from a high end dining experiance. As good as, or better than, his efforts at Fiamma. Bravo!",4
"Smaller portions, for sure. But every bite was delicious.",5
"Very beautiful, very delicious and very expensive",5
The pasta is superb and the fish the best in the City. Wait service was good but not outstanding (a couple of requests forgotten) however the sommelier was excellent.,4
Fascinating menu along with mouth watering specials. Wonderfully helpful and friendly wait staff. Beautiful room. Food that doesn't disappoint. Any other questions?,4
"Remarkable lunch. I was there, because Ruth Reichl speaks of it all the time in twitter.",5
"Now, is one of my favorite restaurants in NYC too. Highly recommended. I will go there every time I visit NYC.",5
"We had a lovely time during our stay at Marea. We pay regular visits to the Michelin star awarded restaurants all over the world and we really enjoyed the atmosphere and the food (and not only the fish, even the Sirloin was of excellent quality!). Service was above average and we received a nice plastified card with the wine label of the wine we ordered as we really enjoyed this bottle.",5
"just amazing. we ordered one of two truffle-topped dishes and they brought out the wrong one which was delicious and we didn't mind. But rather than comp us a glass of wine or dessert, they comped us the correct dish which was topped with some delicious truffles (so we got two truffle dishes for the price of one!) amazing - the food is wonderful and the atmosphere lovely",5
"This is (by far) the best restaurant to open in NYC in the past year. Bold, flavorful food. Beautiful surroundings. Terrific service. While the NYT just awarded Marea three stars, it's truly a four star establishment. And don't miss the (now legendary) pasta with octopus and bone marrow.",4
We had a wonderful evening. We will certainly go back and recommend to our friends. The service was a little slow when delivering the main course. The food was outstanding.,5
"EXCELLENT EXCELLENT EXCELLENT! After trying their sister restaurant Convivio, which was excellent as well, I was compelled to try Marea.It was absolutly fantastic! I reguarly take my wife and two young children to fine dining establishments and many times are met with strange looks from hosteses or rushed subpar service because of this.Not so here! They treated us so well I decided to drive back from CT by myself a few days later and dine at the bar.It was just as excellent!A job well done!Alto is next.Thank You Again for another memorable evening.",5
Excellent food and really extensive wine list with many affordable and interesting Italian wines.,4
We had lunch there for the first time.,5
The food was excellent.,5
"The service needs to be improved, however. We waited quite awhile before a wine steward appeared, although our table waitress was very nice. Also, it appeared that some ""regulars"" were getting special attention, which doesn't sit well with new diners, like us, who could be possible regulars, and believe all diners new or old show get equal attention.",5
"We love your CONVIVIO restaurant, and we have had both lunch and dinner there several times; we felt more at ease there.",5
"At MAREA we felt a bit uncomfortable, maybe because the staff is new and still a bit self-conscious. But the food...delicious!",3
"The food was really outstanding! Service was perfect too. A bit expensive to be honest, but we did order a lot of food. Very good special occassion type place.",4
Great place,4
Best restaurant I have been to recently in the city. Very good.,4
"While chef Michael White's food is delicious, the portions served, at least at lunch, are ridiculously small. So even though the 2 and 3 course options on the lunch menu appear to be a bargain, especially along Central Park South, they're not. The five course option, at least would be sufficient food, and a decent value for the price, though expensive for lunch. I'd like to say that flavor trumps all that, but other than for a one time experience, I'm not sure it does.",4
Superb seafood with an Italian bent. The $89 four course pre fixe is the way to order. Portions seemed to be the right size considering the four courses served. The pasta choices were the equal of its sister restaurant Convivio. Great selection of wines by the glass or bottle by region. Just a wonderful experience.,5
A new place-our first visit. Very informed and helpful waiter and marvelous food.,4
"Was really looking forward to dining here again. We asked for another option after first being seated in the first table as you entered the dining area (of course someone must sit here), but we were looking forward to being seated upstairs, in a bit more cozy atmosphere. Manager is missing some people skills although all others were sweet and accomodating. Everything including bread and salad were extrememly salty.",3
Terrible waitress. ,1
Menu was varied abd food was great,4
A bit noisy and hard to talk buy we willbe back,5
Liked the combination of foods to accent the steak dinner. Different than your traditional NY steak house but yet familiar enough to keep even the most hard core carnivore very happy. Great business spot. however when it gets busy help gets stretched as they forgot my wine.,3
If you are a fan or for that matter not a fan of Italian Steakhouses give this place a try. Great food!!,2
I would give another half star if I could. There were parts of the meal that were great and parts that were good.,5
"The Caesar Salad was okay, but uninspired. My pasta had to be sent back because it wasn't really cooked enough (and I like al dente pasta). The management tried to make up for it with a ""free"" brocolli side dish that was ice cold. When I asked about it they said that's the way they like to do it. Finally, the dessert was inedible. In short, I'm never going back.",4
"The decor and atmosphere is wonderful. It really is a beautiful restaurant. The entire staff was professional, personable, and knowledgeable. The have a very notable wine list and I found it very interesting that the entire staff is kept up to date on the wine menu, even though they have a sommelier. The food was DELICIOUS. The pork shank was cooked perfectly and we barely needed a knife. We enjoyed everything we ordered. The complimentary pasta was incredibly savory. I cannot wait to return. I made our reservation the week that they opened for a month out, and everyone I talk to has been having difficulty booking a reservation. Plan ahead - this is a popular joint!",4
"Noise level is significant and distracting - although it might offset the ""look"" it needs some noise baffling. Food and service were excellent, also great that they allow corkage; the wait for your reservation time can also be longer than expected. Prices are on the high side but a decent value.",5
"Lots of people, fun atmosphere. Chicken parm for 2 can really be for 4. I've had better chicken parm but the food is good. I will go back.",5
"My first visit... enjoyed great salad, delicious pasta (porterhouse agnolotti), and birthday dessert. I cannot wait to go back again!",2
This was our third time eating here. The service is perfection as is the food. It was a bit noisy this time but I think it depends on where you are seated. The tomatoes were the best I had all summer. Brilliant. Everything is authentically Italuan.,5
Trendy and upscale. Interesting menu. But wait staff pushed us to order much more than we needed. Especially when we kept saying that we thought it was too much. He assured us we were good.. We felt taken and therefore the check was much higher than need be. When we advised the manager of our feelings. He couldn't care less. Can't stand a cocky attitude. Have fun if you go but beware!,5
Fabulous experience. Incredible food and service. Need to work on noise control. I will still return for the food. Next time with ear plugs.,3
"We had a reservation for lunch and the space is absolutely gorgeous and the staff is friendly and attentive. We happen to be there during Wine Week where you get 10 1/2 glasses of wine for $10. Started off with scallop crudo and a 6 west coast oysters which were great. We ordered 2 tuscan salads, one shrimp scampi and the other seared yellowfin tuna. The other 2 of us ordered the lobster roll with fries. Everything was awesome. The lobster rolls were awesome, they were a little spicy and it was a really good size for the price. The fries were really good and the sauce that came with them was quite addicting. We did save room for dessert and ordered the blood orange sorbet as well as the strawberry basil sorbet, both were stunning.",4
"food is good, our second visit. could use broader selection, but very good. setting is great. 4 different times, the waiter brought the wrong beverage. A specialty tea was selected from the menu, each time Sambuca was served. Each time it was brought back in different glass. The final bill chared for both the Sambuca and the tea. At the price of the place, it was very poor form",4
Great service and amazing food.,5
"very disappointing subpar steakhouse; I've had better in a dozen cities in America, so this place does not belong in NYC, the food capital of the world",1
The food was excellent and it is a great atmosphere.  I would definitely go back!,5
"We love this restaurant, especially those potatoes (fried in duck fat - you wont find anything yummier - anywhere!)We try to go here whenever we get to NYC.",4
It was great meal.  The side dishes were really great and the service were outstanding.,5
Everything was outstanding!  Best Porterhouse steak we've ever had!  Great Martinis and delicious ice cream!,5
"We loved our meal and the relaxed feel of the restaurant at Quality Meats.  The shrimp cocktail was perfect.........huge, firm and ice cold.  The unique dipping sauces made it a must have.  For dinner my husbands rib eye steak came on the bone which had to be 12 inches long.  I had the filet which was cooked perfectly and tasted wonderful with their bernaise sauce.  Our servicer timed the meal perfectly and was very attentive.  We would go back.  ",5
"One note, however, we were disappointed in their bar.  We arrived hoping to enjoy a cocktail before we went to our table.  However, the bar was very small and the few seats were taken.  Have your drink elsewhere and then head to Quality Meats for dinner.",4
"Took us to a table in a small room in the back. VERY loud and annoying. Do not sit there, and ask to move you. Ruin the nigh unfortunately.",3
The Ribeye was a liitle tough and was a little overcooked.  My wifes tenderloin was great. Oysters were extremely fresh ans bread was delicious.  The sides were mediocre at best.,5
This place is delish but not for a romantic dinner - tables WAY too close together.  Better for a friend or gathering of loud friends.  Steaks are impeccable - corn creme brulee a must!,5
"Totally outstanding! We really enjoyed the food which in all means was superb. The service was exceptionally good with a waitor/somelier that assisted us with great enthusiasm, great knowledge and correct attitude.",4
I will for sure come back in januari when I visit N Y again,1
//Fredric Behmer from Sweden,4
"A fantastic experience.  The food was wonderful, and the freshly made steak sauce was superb.",4
terrible SEATing,4
rough crab,5
lamb too fatty,4
"Great food, great service.",5
"Great steak house.  Would have liked to have suckling pig, but only available for 2.  Had tuna tartare which was prepared with eggs and nicoise olives, very different and very good.  Bone marrow appetizer was very good also; not a lot in the serving (two marrow bones), but since it's so rich, it was plenty.  Rib eye steak was cooked medium as ordered and was very tender and flavorful.  ",5
"Only two negatives.  One was the noise level which was about the loudest I've even experienced at a restaurant.  People were practically shouting.  The second was the condition of the ladies room.  Although very nice, there was paper all over the floor and the toilet paper holder was broken and hanging off the wall.",5
Good steakhouse.,4
Perfect service by the waiter.  The food was incredible.  The atmosphere had a great buzz.  I really enjoyed the experience.,3
"The food was excellent but the service is what made our evening special. I asked the staff - via OpenTable - to make sure to congratulate my spouse on our wedding anniversary on the evening we came for dinner. Every staff member congratulated us throughout the meal. They gave us a couple of glasses of champagne as a gift and even spelled out Happy Anniversary in toffee on my spouse's dessert plate (sticky toffee pudding - highly recommended) and added a lighted candle. This attention to service - on its own - made our dinner special. I would point out that Quality Meats has a steakhouse ambience - which means that you should expect it to be noisy (at least on the first floor, where we were seated).",3
Waiter was knowledgable and helpful without being smarmy or overbearing.  Food was great.,5
The food and service were excellent. This was the 4th time I have been to quality Meats and the food is always great. The Wine list is pricey but you can find pretty much any wine you may desire. Overall a great place to have dinner.,4
"Food was fabulous.  Steak juicy and flavoursome, Parmesan Fries are to die for, and a lovely bottle of Rioja - all that, plus your family around the table - what more could you ask for!! Restaurant was a little quiet, although it was early on a Sunday evening (7pm reservation), so perhaps would have been more lively later (it was lively on my previous visit which was 8.30pm on a weeknight).  I think even when busy, it is possible to have a converation around the table, which is great.  Recommend.",4
Great food - Excellent steak - Love the Green Goddess chopped salad - the dessert is outrageous!,2
"I took a friend to 'Quality Meats' to celebrate her birthday.  I heard great things abou the quality of the meat there, so it was a great disappointment to get burned, charred, tough and fatty piece of sirloin after ordering it ""medium rare.""  It was one of the worse pieces of meat I've ever had at a restaurant, and at almost $50, it was a rip off.",5
"My companion who ordered a filet mignon also got a crispy, burned piece of meat.",4
"The wait staff was pleasant, but confused, and got our orders wrong.  I appreciated that the hostess took off the erroenous orders off the bill, but altogether it was a disppointing experience in terms of the food & the service.",5
More often than not I feel as though steak houses will ignore their sides. I felt the opposite at Quality Meats. I thought the sides were delicious and the meat was bland. I did however find the oysters to be a delightful appetizer.,4
"Absolutely fabulous meal.  Our steak melted in our mouths.  The service was very helpful, but not overwhelming or annoying.  The wine list was superb and we enjoyed every bit.  Bring your expense account - but worth every dime.",3
The meat was extarordinary.,2
Superior service.,4
Try the corn creme brule it is spectacular.,2
"Best meat restaurant in NY, better tha Smith and Bolensky",4
Would not return to this restaurant!,5
Amazing.  The three filets were all cooked perfectly.  And the sides are better than i have had at any other steak house.,4
A very different type of steakhouse...very chic and cutting edge...nice touches and great interior design...Food and service were top notch....Recommend highly,4
"great steaks, drinks almost too big.  very good will go again.",4
Great food!,3
"While Quality Meats ranks alongside steakhouses like Strip House and Del Frisco's in terms of price, the steaks just don't match up. The presentation is great and the staff was very good at being equally doting and restrained; the restaurant itself is beautiful and very well-designed. The side dishes were fairly small portions but tasty and the drinks and desserts were also well-done. But ultimately, my main objective was to enjoy great steak and I left feeling unsatisfied.",4
We had not only a wonderful lunch and a crazy 10 wines for $10 tasting -- the waitstaff was professional and friendly and after saying we were in no hurry we were welcomed to stay for a 3 hour Moms' lunch.  Thank you to Alex and I believe his partner was the lovely Jaimie from Philadelphia.  You made our day!,4
"Of the Smith and Wollensky restaurants, my colleagues and I agree that Quality Meats rates top in terms of service and atmosphere.",4
very good overall.,4
"Great food and excellent design.  Service could be a bit more attentive.  Crowd is upscale touristy (a few blcoks from the Plaza), and the nois elevel is very bad.  Not the place for a romantic dinner, but good for business.",5
Steak TarTar.  That's all I have to say.,4
"Quality Meats offers consistent, high quality food and service.",2
overrated,1
Wait staff was horrendous. Seafood tower was not fresh. Waited forever for drinks. The only saving grace...cream corn brulee was insane,5
LOVED IT! Thought everything from the amuse to the wine was superb. Service was great...a VERY enjoyable experience. :),4
A lively restaurant with delicious food and great service.  Two thumbs up.,5
"one of my favorite places.  Wonderful presentation and quality of food is excellent.  Great atmosphere.....quite noisy, but that's because there's so many people enjoying their meal!  Recommend to all my friend traveling to NYC..visit each time I'm in the city.",4
Steaks are well prepared and the marrow app is top notch.,5
"The food was truly incredible.  EVERYONE at my table of 8 oohed and aaahed the food and we are mostly foodies. It was wonderfully cut meat and wonderfully prepared sides.  The steak tartare is possibly the best I've ever had, even in France.  So completely recommend.",2
"The design/decor is cool.  It is a fun place to be, specialy with a group as it is quite busy. The native oysters were really good but the Ribeye steak lacked flavour, deserts were nothing special either. I had the bluberry cobbler which consisted of a puree of bluberries topped with oat. I went to Mortons a few days later and loved my steak. It is also much cheaper, Mortons has a more corporate feel though.",2
"Appetizers were very well received.  My first steak was beyond overcooked and well done.  The replacement was better, but felt more like an afterthought.  The waitress was very nice and very helpful.  Our room downstairs was very warm.  I said something twice, and the waitress agreed with me that even she thought it was very warm.  Ultimately, despite our asking, it seems like nothing was done.  I don't need to go back.",4
"Awesome if you like a good steak. However, not really your typical steakhouse. Waiters will try to dissuade you from the filet or other typical favorites.",4
Our waiter was great - he helped us pick the best choice from the list of very enticing cuts of meat.  The wine list isn't large but it has some very interesting choices.  This is a very good steak house and we would go back again.,3
"Wine selection very good. Menu selection very good. Side dishes are good. However, the reason for going to this place, The Steak, was way to salty. No comparison to Peter Lueger.",5
"Our first time there, was thrilled with the romantic atmosphere.  The service was",5
outstanding. We had the freshest kumamoto oysters with fabulous dipping sauces.,5
"We shared the rib steak, 24 oz. was more than enough for 2, the sides were great,",4
especially the corn brulee. Can't wait to go back.,5
"MY DAUGHTERS RECOMMENDED THIS PLACE TO ME AND I WAS VERY PLEASED.  THE FOOD WAS WONDERFULLY PREPARED, VERY FRESH AND SEASONAL. THE SERVICE VERY PLEASANT AND EXTREMELY ATTENTIVE WITHOUT BEING OBNOXIOUS.  I AM EATING LUNCH THERE AGAIN ON SEPT. 2, BEFORE I LEAVE FOR HOME BECAUSE I ENJOYED IT SO MUCH AND PLAN ON RETURNING EVERY TIME I AM IN NYC.",5
A great restaurant with great food and great service. Medium rare is really medium rare here the way it ought to be. ,5
The Rib eye was divine and the special touches were great!,5
Thank you QM!,2
"quality meats decor is breathtaking (see phone booth) but the menu is scattered, and the service touts many things other than steak.  while the steak is GREAT, it seems to me that many other items should be stricken from the menu.  everything that was not steak was not awesome. it was good, yes, and innovative, yes, but not awesome.  stick to steak for maximum impact.  i was a tourist, and i found QM online. i will definitely return, even though i live 3000 miles away. cool, busy RESTAURANT, but i did not feel that i was in a steak house.",5
i absolutely loved this place. i plan to go back again next week. highly recommended nad i dont even eat steak! ,5
"fabulous for vegetarians, carnivores, vegas, etc...amazing food and amazing dessert.",3
the hostess and waitress were wonderful and the food was great as well.,4
Food and service was great,5
Fantastic food.,5
"service was bumbling and inattentive.  ""steak"" restaurant could not cook a steak medium.  First it came out rare, then rare again, then well done! Staff grudgingly took the steak back twice and gave attitude about cooking it properly-- what an insult for the price!  Noice level is horrific--The only place that could've had more annoying noise would be an open subway station inside a construction site.",4
"Interesting shift from the Quality Meats version of the menu. We enjoyed our meal and thought the staff who worked with us were excellent. The meal was outstanding and we always enjoy Wine Week and were happy to try Quality Italian for the first time. Certainly better than S&W in Miami, but not as good as Quality Meats. We have enjoyed Wine Week for over ten years and have tried every restaurant available for both fall and spring Wine Week occasions, and determined that Quality Meats was by far the best. We have recommended Quality Meats to many friends, but will suggest they might want to at least see what they think about Quality Italian Steakhouse.",4
"First time there. We went for Wine Week and discovered two beautiful bottles. We shared the Eggplant Polpette appetizer. Exceptional! Our entrees were the Fra Diavolo Lobster Roll, the Grilled Branzino and the Seared Diver Scallops. All were delicious. Would definitely go back and recommend to friends.",5
"Great food, big portions for dinner, but would definitely come back.",5
Amazing food and staff. Unexpected level of coolness for the area. Super great! And YUM!!,4
"Not only is it Quality Italian, but GREAT Italian! The pasta sides are delicious, The Chicken parm is so unique. Guaranteed the table next to you will ask you what you are eating. It comes in the form of an 18inch pizza shape! FABULOUS",5
Lets not forget all the steaks . Go you will in for a treat!,5
"it is our go-to place, since we discovered it. Reservations a must.",4
This place really does serve up a good meal. Cocktails were fabulous (try the bloody mary - it is the best I have ever had in NYC) and the food was delicious.,4
Definately a place to keep returning to.,5
"Great food and service. We were seated early, the specials were great, solid wine list, overall great experience. I will return.",5
Love this place. We live in the neighborhood and have eaten there twice for lunch and for dinner. The service is wonderful and it doesn't matter whether you are light eaters or heavy eaters - they treat you equally well. The food tastes authentically Italian and we can't wait to try everything on the menu.,2
"didn't live up to the hype but was good. the restaurant is quite hard to find. it's actually on 6th avenue, between 57 and 58th streets. the menu is small and parts are quite unique. the dishes were a little salty but pretty good. i was most disappointed that one of our sides came with the apps instead of the main meal and that our waiter didn't have quite the right descriptions. that said the service is very good. everyone is attentive and nice.",2
"Ben Benson's was a 'gold standard', and ribeye here ranks among that level. All food quality was excellent. Presentation and service was very good, friendly and respectful. Fellow diners were also friendly. Overall excellent experience and would return. Only recommendation is overly noisy in single large room, Perhaps sound control acoustics to help offset.",4
great addition to NYC scene- great food- great service- eggplant/barrita app was sensational- fine steaks- very knowledgeable and courteous wait staff,5
"One of the best meals we have eaten in NYC hands down. No easy feat as we have previously noshed at Eleven Madison Park, Nomad, Daniel, Jean Georges, Grammercy Tavern, Locanda Verde, Babbo and a host of others...My halibut may rank as one of the best fish dishes ever, my companion's steak was to die for. Desserts were amazing, great service, nothing but accolades for our night out. Loved it and would go back in a heartbeat.",3
"When you have the word ""quality"" in your name it she be just that. This experience was a huge disappointment. The food was average at best. Compared to the so many other choices in Manhattan for Italian food this certainly does not hold a candle to even an average place in Little Italy.",4
"The chicken parmagian pizza was horrible. It is supposed to be the ""signature"" dish. We paid about 60 dollars forwhat we thought was chicken parmagian but it was a breaded chicken pattie, with way too much bread crumbs and little taste. The waiter should have been more informative about this dish, it was terrible! Service was just okay.",4
"The food and the service were wonderful. However, you had to shout across the table to make yourself heard. This really affected our enjoyment of Quality Italian.",5
"Excellent service, Excellent food.",3
Highly Recommend,2
It was so loud even our waiter couldn't speak over the noise! The table next to us was lip reading!,4
Main course steaks perfectly cooked with nice char. The fish was well done but not very large portions. The appetizers were unimpressive. Filet ravioli was nothing special. The cesar salad was a fail: a half dozen leaves of romaine dressed in simple dressing. The waiter wad friendly but maybe too opinionated.,2
"This restaurant is from the man who practically invented The NYC Steakhouse and food runs in his veins. . The menu is short and to the point. The food is excellent if you don’t take it too seriously. They start you off with complimentary, warm, butter-topped rolls, dusted with herbs and sea salt. Yum! And then it's off to the races. There's a great selection of appetizers, pastas and a lot of influence in their entrees from their sister restaurant Quality meats. There's a lot of variety on the menu but don't come here for red sauce and lasagna that you might be better off eating in Little Italy. I had a great dining experience here and I recommend it highly.",3
"My guests and I thought very highly of Marea. The restaurant staff were knowledgeable and gracious, we were impressed by the room's esthetics and wowed by the food.",5
"All of the food was fantastic, with the exception of the steak. The steak was dry and bland; we've had better steaks at home. This was disappointing considering we went for the steaks. However, I have to say everything else was fantastic. And, it's always a nice touch when the waiter brings something out compliments of the chef.",2
"Ther rib steak (for two), ordered medium, came raw! The waiter aware of this took it back. Half an hour later (yes that long), it was served - tough and overdone. When the waiter was contacted about a piece of burned meat, he responded (as if it was a reasonable explanation) that must have been one of the slices that was cut. We could not eat much of it. They tried to make it up by bringing free side dishes and cutting down the price but a steak at Tad's would have been preferable. Quality meat? Who can tell? Certainly not quality grilling.Our evening was ruined. They brought free dessert  but would not even let us pick it and brought a flavor of ice cream we did not like and a chocolate raspberry tart that we would not have ordered.",5
"After hearing rave reviews from many of my friends I knew Quality Italian was a must for date night. From start to finish, everything about our meal was excellent. We started with the clams, a popular dish but I'll say these were the best I've had in NYC! Next we ordered the filets- one classic and one Gorgonzola with the corn creme brûlée as our side. The filets were perfectly cooked and the corn was unique and tasty. We both were so full that we had to skip dessert!",5
"The overall experience at marea was wonderful. The room is large, there is adequate space between the tables and the menu is very large. The menu focuses on seafood with only select meat options. Plus the portions are very small compared to the price and considering you need to order numerous courses to get any sense of satiety.",3
Appetizers were very good. Pastas were average. The mixtures in the pasta sauces were muddled - complexity overwhelmed the fish / crustaceans.,3
"Service was good, once seated. Had to wait 30 minutes beyond our reservation time for our table. Fish entrees were a bit overcooked. Attractive restaurant.",2
Very Very disapointed in the food.,4
It was a wonderful evening...loved the food. Resturant is beautiful and service good without being pretentious. There was NO attitude by any of the staff. We will return and recommend,4
Room is fit for adults; not too noisy. The food is very much of the moment. Fresh crudite and a menu that allows you to create a tasting menu of your own should you choose. Service was also great.,5
"Outstanding preparations for seafood lovers. The ricci di mare crudo was particularly memorable. The service is attentive without being overbearing. When I dined there, Mario Batali was checking it out!",4
"Enjoyed birthday diner,restaurant is beautiful, but a bit noisy.",4
"great Food, fresh fish,portion a the smaller and expensive side.",5
Service very attentive.,5
Enjoyed the restaurant. Food was fabulous...wine list offered lots of choices in the $30 - $70 range...service was impeccable. A great addition to the New York restaurant scene.,4
"Food was superb with excellent service. The prix fix is perfect for a business lunch and as the portions appropriate, you don't head back to work feeling like you just ate a buick.",5
An outstanding dining experience !!,4
This was a great experience from first to last. The spaghetti with crab and sea urchin is the best I've seen including Venice. Gracious staff who shared the passion for the food that the kitchen does. Worth a splurge - and it definitely was one.,5
"The food was delicious but the service was outstanding! Fit for food snobs, but with a friendly down-to-earth staff. We chatted with everyone from the bartender and host to the chef, waiters, and bus boys and really felt welcome there. Crowd ranged from stylish young people to business folk to families and cute old couples. The fusilli alone is well worth the trip, and the zucchini torte is to die for!",5
Marea is an excelent addition to my neighborhood dining. Seafood and Fish were exceptionally fresh and well prepared. I usually do not like fix prix but found the $34 lunch of good value. We particularly liked our waiter who was very well informed but not overbearing...The decor is very tasteful and comfortable,4
"excellent food - original, with superb execution; service - efficient, discrete.",4
place was cowded and the noise level was within the comfort range; one could have a conversation.,5
The food was superb. Fresh fish and pasta memorable.,5
Kudos to Michael White--another restaurant with delicious food.,2
"I had their $89 four-course prix fixe dinner, which is actually a good deal for a restaurant of this caliber. I seconded the rave reviews on lobster with burrata and the brilliant pasta. For entree, I tried the adriatic seafood soup and the seaweed-marinated halibut. The different kinds of shellfish in the soup tasted very fresh and delicious. The flavor of the soup itself is on the subtle side but has its impacts. All the ingredients come together naturally. The only issue I had was that the halibut and the fillet in the otherwise wonderful seafood soup was a little bland.",4
Desserts were all done nicely. Service was great and the dining room felt casual but retained elegance. I'd be back once I see some changes in the fish entree.,5
One of the best restaurant I have ever been to ( internationally). Food was just breathless. A Perfection. Every dishes was delicious which is rare in restaurant!,2
"Superb meal - start to finish. Warmly greeted by the hosts at the door, enjoyed leisurely drink at the bar, well guided by professional friendly server (who seemed as pleased to have us there as we were to be there). A terrific meal - delicious food, beautifully presented. (All the more so particularly in juxtaposition to the pathetic dinner 'accented' by horrid service at Bar Artisinal the following night.)",5
"It is sad to report that apart from the ambiance and service, both very good to outstanding, the most important ingredient, namely the food, was utterly disappointing. With the exception of the bread service which was exceptional, every course in the elaborate prix-fixe menu was at best tasteless or at worst inedible.",4
"New York City desperately needs another good seafood restaurant. Goodness knows we can, by now, count them on the fingers of one hand. We had very high hopes and expectation of this newcomer, but dash it, after tasting nine different dishes we cannot in all honesty rate it anything other than poor.",5
"We were five people and we tasted each other's dishes; some were absolutely brilliant, others very good, and one dish, halibut, boring and undercooked; it's very expensive.",5
Always wonderful!,4
The food was mediocre. The service was efficient but impersonal and indifferent. We were pushed to order and the check dropped before we were ready. The restaurant itself is beautiful.,5
"The overall feeling was that the staff were ""going through the motions"" and didn't really care about pleasing the guests.",5
"The restaurant was packed. Notwithstanding the service and quality of food was excellent. I have taken clients to the restaurant and several occasions. What mind more seating options, and would be willing to pay for the same. That would be a great option.",4
Gary and Francesco made the evening even more enjoyable with their excellent recommendations.,4
The pasta I ordered was one of the best I have had in years. I started with a fresh green salad that was perfect. The wine list is extensive but does have a number of very good reasonably priced wines.,4
"The restaurant was fabulous. Wait staff smiling , warm, attentive. Great service. Wonderful food with great attention to detail. We were four and created our own tasting menu by ordering many different menu items. The staff accomodated everything without a hitch and made sure we were able to share things so everyone got to try everything. In a couple of cases when there were 3 pieces they made sure they brought 4 so everyone got their share. It was amazingly delicious and fun, a happy pleasant atmosphere. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great dining rcperience. I'm looking forward to visiting there again very soon, maybe to try lunch next time.",4
GREAT !! ,5
 4 star quality,3
go now before you wont be able to!!!,2
"The service was excellent - friendly, attentive, and unobtrusive. I liked the decor - light and uncluttered although I found the leather tub chairs rather uncomfortable. The food was a rather mixed bag. The spaghetti with crab and sea urchin entree is very very good. The seared scallops entree was also well executed. The stuffed calamari appetizer was wonderful. Unfortunately we also tried 3 of the appetizers that were meant to be shared and all 3 were very disappointing (zucchini flowers, sea urchin with lardo, and shrimp with chickpeas). The risotto with lobster and other seafood entree was okay but far from memorable. I would go back but it wouldn't be one of the first choices on my list unless the consistency of the menu improves.",5
"WOW! My first time here, and I selected to try many ""small""plates, the experienece was sublime, every bite had individua;l, subtle flavors and textures, lots talent in the kitchen....",5
"This is a truly excellent restaurant. Superb ambiance, excellent food and winelist. An excellent new addition to the NY food scene.",4
"The decor and atmosphere were very nice. The appetitizers and pasta were very good. However, the main course, I had the halibut and my wife had the john dory were both not tasty and on the dry side. Waiter was efficient and nice, but the bus boys/girls need more training.",4
"We had been to Del Frisco’s once before and liked the food so well we decided to go back on our recent trip to NYC.  Our son gave us a gift card for our anniversary and we had a great meal.  The only issue with the restaurant is the congestion with the check in desk, the coat check, and the bar immediately inside the main entrance, also no with people waiting for seating.  We made our reservation nearly 2 weeks ahead and could only get a 4:30 time on the day we wanted.   MAKE A RESERVATION EARLY!",5
Steak was ordered medium and came rare. After they cut it they took it back and grilled it again they should have replaced it. It was dry and over cooked not what you would expect from this steakhouse it their price level.,3
"Beautiful decor, great service and delicious food.",5
Favorite steakhouse in the city!!,5
Best steak I’ve ever had!  Service was fantastic! We loved the restaurant. It was first class all of the way with out being stuffy.,5
Appetizers plated at different times,3
Ambiance wasn’t festive in the “back room”,5
"Food quality was good but for the prices, expected service to be top-notch.",5
"My wife and I went to New York for a weekend to celebrate my birthday.  Although we were slightly late for our dinner reservation, we were seated quite promptly despite how busy the restaurant is.  We were seated at the basement level which is a lot quieter than the main floor.  Amy who served us was attentive, and recommended all the popular food options on an extensive menu.  ",1
"The food was excellent from start to finish.  As a starter, the crab cake and foi gras (fresh!) were mouth-watering.  The double eagle steak was cooked to perfection and full of flavour.  The desert trio was on the house with a white and dark chocolate writing of ""Happy Birthday"".  I also received a birthday card signed by all the staff at Del Frisco.  What a nice personal touch.  All in all, one of my best gustatory experience in New York!",5
"The food was incredible. Make sure to get the king crab truffle butter! Service was also impeccable; we were there celebrating an anniversary and they gave a card and complimentary champagne, which was wonderful and thoughtful.",5
"Marea is a special place. You realize this the moment you walk in. A lighted, beautiful room that is both intimate and convivial at the same time, there is a human touch and an attention to service that alerts you immediately to the level of detail, precision and talent in and out of the kitchen. The food is delicious - classic ingredients presented in creative, sublime ways. The menu is so varied you could eat there every day of the week and never eat a bit of the same thing twice. Wine pairings highly recommended. They fit the food exceptionally.",5
"A very memorable evening. Great food. Prefectly cooked sea bass. The service was attentive, helpful and not too intrusive. Knowledgeable wine staff; youthful appearances are deceiving. Overall a fantastic night. Worth all the publicity they are garnering.",5
We had a wonderful time. Quite an enjoyable experience!,4
"the food was excellent.the place looks good, contemporary yet luxurious. the preparation of each dish was interesting without being overly complex or ""cute"". the homemade pasta was wonderful and the pairings were fresh and delicious. the fish ""soup"" was truly great, the best we've ever had.",5
"the staff is knowledgable and very accommodating. they all seemed involved in making our dining experience a comfortable, good one, without hovering or being overly formal or familiar...a truly grownup, well dressed crowd and a menu that was filled with wonderful choices. would highly recommend.",4
"Overall the restaurant was beautiful, food delicious, but the owner was quite rude when we arrived. Due to the President being in town, we were caught in traffic for road closures. We had left our house knowing this at 4:30 for a 5:45 reservation. When we arrived at the restaurant at 6:10, we were scolded and told we were VERY late, and they needed the table back by 8:30. What kind of customer service is this? We being in the same business, realizes that they have reservations booked again after us, but that is no reason to be so rude to a customer. The owner needs to brush up on his attitude and try to be more pleasant.",4
"Good food and excellent wine list but lots of rules. ""We have only a few tables of 4 and they are already booked"" when you try to make a reservation for 7:30 or 8 PM 2 weeks ahead. (There are LOTS of tables of 4). Any 3 crudos as a tasting it says on the menu. ""Oh, sorry but you can't include the toro tartare."" Can I get a half portion of the pasta as a starter. ""No, but I could split it.""",4
Back room is often very noisy because they put groups of 8 back there.,2
Wine list excellent with many good choices below $50.,5
"We were favorably impressed. Food was uniformly very good. Several dishes had a lot going on but the restaurant pulled it off. Pasta dishes were excellent as was the stuffed squid. Desserts and bread also very good. Espresso not bad. Only dish I would not recommend was the giant clam. It was fine but the preparation did nothing to improve the dish as compared to the clam simply out of the shell. To the contrary, it only masked the freshness and outstanding taste of the clam itself.",3
I would go back.,5
"Lighting was too bright and there were way too many men in suits observing. I have no idea why there were so many men in suits walking around and they all seemed nervous which made me nervous. Their mood should be a little more light and train the waiters more so that men in suits aren't required. Food was ok, but I was expecting to be WOW'd. I will stick with Da Umberto's.",5
Marea has only been open for short time but I predict it will be very popular. The food was excellent and presentation was outstanding....the china is beautiful and I think everyone is going to want to take along the salt/pepper/cream service along with the comfortable and stunning chairs. Obviously much thought went into the decor. Portions are small so if you are a big eater; I'd suggest going somewhere else but if you like delicate flavors and great taste...visit Marea. The chef stopped out to say 'hello' which I always appreciate. We were there for lunch and had a beautiful view of Central Park and we would visit againfor dinne!,5
"Despite being ""greeted"" by the most arrogant, dismissive man up front (we were quickly wisked into the crudo bar -- apparently spending $450 on dinner doesn't qualify you for a table in the regular dining room), the remainder of our service was wonderful.",2
"If I hadn't been hosting a business dinner, I would have immediately walked out (bringing my $450 with me) of this establishmenyt. Management needs to examine and remedy the obnoxious behavior of this man.",5
"Excellent appetizers and desserts. Main courses were weakest part of dinner. Lovely service, great table, enjoyable atmosphere. Will definitely return soon.",4
Great- love the wines by the glass.They go well with the different courses.,3
This is a place for fish! Teh whole fish experience is one not to be missed. Simple yet fresh and delicious. Ask for advice and you will get honesty.,3
"For the kind of money they charge, there is no excuse for the mediocrity of the food. They need to do way, way better in the presentation and inventiveness of their menu. It was pedestrian.",4
The food was divine!!!,5
"The receptionist seated us at a table which, according to her, was what we requested in our reservation. This is very important because it determines in part whether or not it will turn out to be a pleasant dining experience for us. The 4 course meal for $89 is a good deal. There was a timing gap between the antipasto and the pasta course. We called the waiter's attention to it and he immediately corrected the situation.",5
The sea bass that I ordered was not flavorful but my guy who has a discriminating taste enjoyed the halibut. He also liked the vegetables that were served with it.,3
We will definitely dine at the restaurant again.,4
"Good food, nothing exiting, pricy",4
The pasta course was excellent but some of the appetizers and main courses were too complicated with multiple ingredients...less would be more.,5
"Outstanding service and food. The $89 prix-fixe may seem steep, but it includes 4 courses. Appetizers and pasta dishes with seafood were the notables during our dinner. The fish main courses are very good, but not outstanding like the 2 predecessors. Would definitely go there again and order ala carte for just appetizer and pasta dish.",5
"My wife and I split the grilled bream. She thought it was a little too salty. I liked it just fine. Everything else was great. We also ate at Alto and Convivio, two other restaurants by the same group/chef. All were great.",5
"Just what Columbus Circle needed -- another posh restaurant! But Marea is excellent, semi-seafoody, semi-Italian, served with style and culinary skill. Pricey, but first-rate.",5
Had a great time and the food is good. But I think Convivo is so much better in terms of food and ambience. Thank you,4
Great combination of ambiance and food. The ability to incorporate several menu items into a prix fixe dinner was an unexpected plus which will be welcome by foodies wishing to try something new without breaking the bank.,4
The Meat! Need I say anything else? Well of course the bone marrow is to die for.,5
Food was extremely overpriced and not good.  Small portions and average taste.  Save yourself some money and go enjoy a nice meal somewhere else.,5
Food was amazing and service was excellent. We had the special filet that is flavored with 3 different specialties. We also had the bacon as an appetizer. It was all delicious!,5
Amazing steaks with a resturant packed to capacity! We will definitely be back next year for Christmas!!!!,4
Del Friscos is the best and just keeps getting better. Felix is second to none. He runs an amazing restaurant. Would dine here every week if I could!! Thank you for always helping us create great memories.,3
We love DF! They know we like a booth and even during this busy holiday time they saved a booth for us. The food is always absolutely amazing. The service is top notch. My favorite restaurant in the world :)!,3
"Del Frisco's is a great restaurant, our waiter Chris was impeccable and the food was delicious. I have already recommended the restaurant to others, and will continue to. ",3
One negative point was that the restaurant felt very busy with tables all crammed in. Our host who showed us the table was not very accommodating and due to being very crammed we were not allowed the pram next to our table and therefore we had to hold our 16 week old baby.,5
Took 30 minutes for dinner to be served.  The first bite of my filet was stringy with gristle.  There are too many better steak/chop houses with better value and quality to put up with Del Frisco's reliance on their overblown reputation.,5
We go every year at this time because of where it is located the decorations outside are beautiful. The restaurant also decorated lovely.  This time our waiter was not good at all. No interest.  Secondly 4 of us had steak and when they asked us to cut and check 4 steaks went back they were raw. The person serving the steak came over with a flash light on my steak to look inside. Really. Did he think I was lieing. So we ate the sides filled up then the steaks came back and we were full.  It,5
Put a damper on our meal.,5
The service wasn’t that good. A drink was forgotten about. Then after a couple of passes it finally came. I didn’t like the table  either. We were stuck in the back room by the bar. For the price I didn’t get that top shelf feeling. I would go to other restaurants in NYC before I would ever go back. I wanted a table upstairs to look out onto avenue of Americas but they told us we would have to be out by 7:15. REALLY?,2
"Was our 10th time, always exceeds our expectations, it is our family's ""go to"" special occasion place!",5
"Seated very rapidly, our server was excellent, food great as ever. Atmosphere  was brilliant",5
Great food as always. We come to the City multiple times a year and always dine at your establishment. Love it.,5
Absolutely wonderful! Come every year for Christmas. Even the side dishes are as good as the entrees.,4
"What a pity!! Food was delicious except for 2 things. The lobster mac and cheese came out COLD, for $20 mac and cheese this should have been hot. Sent it back.",5
The salmon on the business lunch was also COLD! It had been sitting waiting to be picked up for a long time. Sent it back.,4
"The service was poor. It's a pity because despite cold food, it was delicious.",5
"The waitress was always selling! They are sales people and not wait staff. Be aware, we pointed out that the wines on the menu were the low end European wines and that charging $20 a glass for a $20 bottle was weird. The waitress did not listen to what we were telling her and her only rebuttals was ""we have a very good wine selection"". She clearly didn't know anything about wine but insisted pushing the wine menu upon us. Be aware of this. They seem desperate for sales.",4
Service was SLOW. Had to get the waitresses attention many times. Asked for a wine menu and she disappears for 15mins only to discover the wine menu was at the station right next to us. If you want something done properly you have to do it yourself.,5
Multiple times had to flag down waitresss due to delays. Asked her where the food was several times and it came out cold. Walked up to her on another table and gave her back the salmon telling her it was cold. ,4
"This place was not even busy, only half the tables were in use at the time. I have no explanation as to why the service was slow or poor. It's such a pity because I had a better experience last time and brought a friend here hoping to show her a good time in NYC. Oh well. No next time or recommendation from us.",2
Left a tip of 15% which was more than generous for this place. Waitress proceeded to ignore us immediately and stopped selling us. Maybe she got it this time.,5
Prima lunch met de beste steak in town.,5
"It was our first time there and we liked! Service wasn’t the best but bad apples can be everywhere. However, food was very comforting and tasty. Definitely we will be back!",5
Great food and great service at lunch with my wife on a day trip to NYC to see the Radio City Rockette’s Christmas Show,4
"I enjoy everything about the delfriscos, the restaurant itself as well as the location of the restaurant very convenient to get to and a very nice atmosphere both inside and out",5
"Del Frisco's is one of the great, authentic steak houses.  The steaks are perfection.  The sides are outstanding.  The servers are excellent.  We chose this restaurant for my husband's birthday lunch, and we were not disappointed.  The restaurant was busy and lively.  Our server took our order quickly, and we were served in a very reasonable amount of time.  My husband was served quite a chunk of lemon cake for his birthday - a very nice surprise, and tasty, too!",5
"the choice of music was very poor, butn otherwise a lovely evening.",5
"Took my dad here for a pre-Father's day dinner and he absolutely loved it! We tried the prix-fixe option and it was worth the expense, the problem was there was so much food that we could hardly eat. Don't be fooled - at Marea, the prix-fixe doesn't mean smaller portions. Some of the yummiest options were the blue shrimp tartar, the mushroom risotto and the sirlon steak!!! I was dubious about the desserts, but the were magnificent too! Go with an empty stomach.",5
"Our dinner at Marea was fantastic! The food was great, the staff friendly and knowledgeable, and the bottle of wine we chose was perfect. We had a two-course meal with dessert and everything tasted amazing, even the bread was fresh and delicious. I only wish we had more time to spend as we had a show to get to around the corner. I will definitely be going back for more.",5
It was great. Everything was perfect,4
Food and service was truly excellent. Fish dishes were to perfection and portions were decent. Restaurant is a bit pricey even with the prix fixe dinner but well worth the experience. I will return but only for very special occasions.,3
"food excelent, decor very nice, service not so good, price OK",4
"Another very good fish restaurant in midtown; great for after Lincoln Center; the four course meal, while a tad expensive, is a great idea for explaining how to handle the immense menu; well thought out wine list but categories make ordering wine a bit difficult",3
"The room is beautiful, but the tables for two are all banquet seating so only one person can enjoy the ambience of the room which is very nice...The food is great. Although the dishes may seem small they are filling and by the end of the meal you will be very satisfied. Everything we ate tasted delicious. The crowd is a very polished sophisticated NY scene, young and older...not trendy but very sharp crowd.",5
"One of the best dining experiences we have ever had. Service was superb, every dish was delightful and delicious. Not only was the food delectable and fresh but the presentation of each dish was exquisite. Some very unusual choices available as well as known options.",4
"Amazing!  My husband loves steak dinners and cannot stop talking about our awesome meal last night. Everything was great: from the food to the service to the ambiance, we will be back!!",5
Although tables for two are very close the food and service are excellent. A real neighborhood gem. Highly recommend,5
"un restaurante siempre lleno de gente con ambiente , la comida estupenda , unas salsas maravillosas para todo lo que ofrecen   Siempre un lugar delicioso para comer en NY.",5
A long time favorite is still the best steakhouse in mid-town Manhattan.,5
Excelente comida y atenciones del personal a cargo de la cena.,5
Comida exquisita,3
Service was great! The porterhouse steak was super fatty and too chewy. Sides were nothing special.,3
"I’ve dined at Quality Meats in New York several times a year since stumbling across it during a blizzard in 2011. Usually for large business meals, but other times for special occasions, like today. It’s been impeccable, until now. Today was solidly mediocre. Poor service. Just OK food. I had a better steak last week at Sullivan’s in Raleigh, which is, no disrespect to the good people in Raleigh, not a compliment to QM’s record when it comes to a bone-in filet.  Not sure if they got new management or if it was just a bad server on their first night, but the whole thing was like an overpriced Applebee’s. Sorry. Will take a break and have to find quality meats elsewhere for a while.",5
Anniversary,5
"After hearing good reviews, our expectations were set relatively high... and the actual experience surpassed those expectations with ease.",5
"My friend and I enjoyed a glass of red wine as we split the Grilled Bacon appetizer and the Dry Aged Porterhouse for two from The Butcher's Cut menu with a side of Grilled Asparagus. For dessert, we ordered the Stucky Toffee Pudding and the Warm Apple & Plum Tart to go with our port. If you were to order what we did, you would certainly not be disappointed.",4
"Awesome food , the steaks the service the only thing that was not good was the fried potatoes never add lemons with bacon and onions",1
"Problem with wine service. We brought a champagne and a red. Champagne was served room temperature in an “all purpose” glass. The red was decanted long after we finished the champagne. Steak was excellent (although it took a full 1.5 hours), but is QM a truly high-end, sophisticated New York steakhouse? Questionable.",5
"I usually don't feel compelled to write a full review but feel so to do this time. It was probably the worst I have ever been treated at a restaurant. I presume Quality Meats has forgotten it is in the Service business, that the Customer matters and what ""Quality"" actually means. I left a note on the bill and I have yet to hear from Rodrigo, the General Manager, more than a week later. ",5
"They did not seat us when we arrived even though I had called and confirmed my reservation. To make matters worse, the hostess continued to blame us for the fiasco (she said she assumed we were not coming as we were a few minutes late) and lied to my face multiple times including stating she was the manager when I politely asked to speak to one. She also marked me as a ""No-Show"" -- I couldn't submit this review until I wrote to Open Table.",4
"I did speak to the manager,Kevin, on the floor more than an hour later (we were seated 45 minutes late, no menus or drinks for another 20 minutes) but all he did was state that he had not witnessed the situation and hadn't been privy to the conversation. Defeats the purpose of talking to a manager.",3
"The server (the 2nd one, the 1st one did not show up after drinks were late) did the best he could. He even tried to take the dessert off the bill since the kitchen was out of the dessert we ordered upon his recommendation. I asked him to put it back on the bill and paid (I tipped him 20% since it was not his fault) and left.",2
"Needless to say, I am not going back to any of their restaurants again (I used to fairly often for business dinners) and wouldn't recommend it to any Open Table users. NYC has far too many options for a customer to feel like a restaurant is doing them a favor and that they should be thankful to be eating there. Goodbye......we won't miss you, Quality Meats!",5
"Great steakhouse recommended to us by friends and it didn’t disappoint - exceptionally good steak, we shared a porterhouse between 3 as 2 of is aren’t big eaters and it was absolutely delicious, lovely atmosphere. We went with the kids early evening and had amazing service.",5
"This was our second time to go to Quality Meats and we will go again the next time we visit NYC.  It's a beautiful, quaint restaurant with great food and great service.",2
Food was delicious. Our waiter was David and he was great. Very attentive and perfect with his suggestions. We really had a great night. We were so full from dinner and we had tickets to a show. After the show we went back to the restaurant for dessert. The sticky toffee pudding was outstanding!!!,5
"We'd been to Quality Meats in the past and had a spectacular meal, but this time it proves that bad service can do in the best food. We got our table and proceeded to go thru 3 different waiters and 40 minutes before we could get our order in, 20 before even getting menus. And this was at 8:45pm, so  you'd think the worst of the dinner rush would be over. We complained, and then suddenly they rushed thru 3 courses as fast as they could, which of course is not the answer. and then they didn't even offer us a dessert or drink to apologize. And the meal cost over $400 for 3 people. And although the steaks are amazing, we never have to go back.",5
Left very disappointed with the service on what was out first night in New York. A real shame as we had been very much looking forward to dining here.,1
"Our steaks arrived a full 45 minutes after our starters, and mine was far, far beyond medium rare. When I complained, the waiter tried to explain that because my wife had opted for hers medium/well that our steaks had taken longer to come. In what world a medium/well cooked steak takes that long, I'm not sure.",1
"My steak was replaced, and a complimentary side given. However, by the time this had arrived, my wife was almost finished. A manager did then bring another complimentary dish (the same one!) and said that my steak would be on the house. It turned out that both steaks were removed, which I thought was very decent of them.",3
"However, the service effectively spoiled our first night in this amazing city",4
Excellent meal.  Outstanding meat!,5
"The food was top-notch. Well worth the price, great service, friendly servers and great drinks. Awesome atmosphere",5
"I appreciate being accommodated for a last minute reservation. The staff was excellent! The restaurant itself was very chilly, I kept warm with my coat on my lap. Also, to enjoy my meal while it was still warm I had to eat it fairly quickly. Which rushed the experience. I would have liked to take my time to enjoy the meal/experience with my husband. It was our 21st wedding anniversary. I would still return or recommend.",4
"The servers were overbearing in trying to take our order quickly after our arrival despite the fact that it was only 5:30 pm and the restaurant was far from busy. When they finally caught on that we wanted to enjoy our cocktail a moment or two before ordering, they then ghosted us the rest of the evening. Food was fine but completely unremarkable and terribly overpriced even for NYC.",5
Great food. Always a pleasure visiting there.,5
Really great food! Definitely worth going to!,5
Bad service.,5
"We waited 45mins for our reservation, and 30mins to order a drink at the bar while waiting. Upon getting seated, our server told us that we needed to order everything at once because the kitchen was backed up. Food was subpar and lukewarm upon arrival. Overall very unsatisfactory meal, food and service, especially for the price point. Will never go back.",5
We returned for the lobster but it was taken off the menu.  Also the spinach was very salty and hard to eat.,2
We always enjoy Quality Meats. They are high end and the wait staff can be a bit aloof but still friendly enough. Food is delicious every time we have gone and not as pricey as other steakhouse like DelFriscos.,3
Food and service was fantastic.  Went for my husband's birthday party and they gave us a great table.  Service was terrific.  I needed to eat gluten free and they accomodated me perfectly.,4
Great steak .... what more can you want (and try the Yorkshire Spinach)!,5
"My favorite steakhouse in NYC. Always have a great experience, and the food is delicious!",5
I am from Texas and it is hard to beat our steaks - but Quality Meats makes the best bone in filet I have ever had. ,1
"Great like last time, but tried the bacon with jalapeños and house-made peanut butter this go-around -- wasn't sure what to expect, but totally worth it...esp followed by a porterhouse for two!",5
Service was great Bacon & peanut butter appetizer was incredible Steak tomahawk was no flavor & fatty not very good at all & I am a steak person,4
"Quality Meats was delightful!  The food, wine, service, and vibe were all on point.  I was visiting NYC from South Florida and enjoyed it so much that I would highly consider returning even with all the amazing eateries in the city.",5
"Came here to celebrate my friend's birthday after we went to see a Broadway show.  We got there 20 mins prior to reservation time.  After checking my reservation, the hostess asked that we wait a little bit for the table to be ready.  Thought it was a little strange considering there were a lot of empty tables.  That didn't matter because the group wanted drinks anyway.  We sat at the bar, ordered our drinks and then our hostess came up to tell us the table is ready (coincidence?)  Not a big deal.  Took our drinks to the table.",4
"The waiter and staff who helped us were fantastic.  Told us recommendations.  We got the Double Rib for two and the Porter House for two, along with 2 apps and 2 sides, thinking that would be enough for a party of 4.  Boy, did we over ordered!  The Double Rib was huge!  The 4 of us could've eaten that and still be full.  Both cuts were delicious & cooked to perfection.  I like my steak medium rare and it was done perfectly.  I've been to other steakhouses and they overcook it.  It was seasoned perfectly and the steak sauce was good too (I normally don't like sauce on my steak).  ",5
"We didn't finish both steaks, so we asked the waiter to wrap up the leftovers (including the bones, still a lot of meat on it).  My friend took it home and later told me the steaks were still good.  ",5
"The bill came out to a bit under $500 for 4 people (including drinks, dessert and tips).  Obviously not a place we would come for a regular dinner.   But for a special occasion, definitely.  Great atmosphere, food is good and service is fantastic.",5
One of the best. Always perfect.,5
Food was outstanding.  Service was amazing.  The best steak in town.,5
just an overall great experience...exactly what I expected to get based off of friends recomendation,5
The food Was fantastic and the atmosphere Wonderful!  We would highly recommend it.,5
"Hands down one of the best meals we have ever had and not just in NY.  Beautiful restaurant, wonderful service and the menu is amazing.  Our steaks were cooked to perfection and everyone has to try the creamed spinach Yorkshire. Two glasses of champagne and a dessert were a nice complimentary surprise at the end of our meal.  Manager came over personally and chatted for a minute with us.   We can not wait to return to Quality Meats again.",3
The steak I had was very delicious ! We were seated very fast and the service was great !,3
"Literally one of THE best steaks I've ever had! I'm a gal who grew up in Oklahoma who has had many good steaks all over the country, but nothing like the bone-in filet I enjoyed! It was heaven. Mouth watering deliciousness, warm, tender, melt-in-your mouth steak. Service was impeccable, staff was very friendly and if you couldn't decide on which wine they had someone to assist with that as well. An absolute must for steak and meat lovers. I highly recommend the grilled thick cut bacon and creamed corn brûlée.",5
Good food.  The service was rushed and indifferent.,5
Top floor is so cold that diners had their coats on. Food got cold quickly,3
A trip to NYC would not be complete without dinner any Quality Meats! There is nothing better. Before a Broadway show. The corn cream brûlée is as good as dessert!,5
"Excelent meat. Only problem is that when you get in, there was a not nice smell walking",3
Gave us a very bad table in spite of knowing that we booked thru Open Table....There were other better tables but they gave us a very bad table with lots of noise around....,5
Group of four from Japan - dinner on a Thursday night. Service was first rate as one might expect at a restaurant of this quality. ,5
Bacon starter (fantastic) and then we split 2 large steaks between us. Sides included the corn (just great) and asparagus. ,5
Beers to start and then a bottle off the wine list. ,5
Total was $400 or so without tip - standard prices for a meal of this sort back home in Japan.,1
Enjoyed the experience. Eaten better steak in Japan  (but then again Japanese beef is the best in the world) these were very good cuts of beef - certainly will return. ,3
"Very noisy and tiny space, not the venue for a romantic date.",5
Could not be seated until 2nd person arrived which is in my experience unusual.,5
Hostess in jeans!!!,5
"Instead had to wait in a crowded, noisy bar area.",4
Food and service very good but the noise was intolerable.,5
Would not return,5
Amazing dinner!  The servers were incredible...they truly cared to make sure everything was perfect!  They do an INCREDIBLE job.,5
Thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience. Delicious food and great wine list,5
The server was extremely nice! it made the place more impressive to me. We ordered porterhouse in medium but looked like it was over-cooked. As we told it to the server he quickly fixed it with dish! The atmosphere was good as well.,4
"Best steak meal EVER!!!! Order the Tower of Seafood- the Seafood Bouquet was a huge hit- three tiers of lobster, jumbo shrimp, clams, crab and oysters with ceviche- OMG>>>>",4
The stake was over cooked,5
"Our waiter, Chris, was awesome.  He made not only the over all  experience very special for us, but extra special for my son, who turned 15.  The restaurant was able to get us seated in a very timely manner.  The steaks were very good and the wine choice, by the sommelier, was excellent.  ",5
"this restaurant way way way too noisy!  granted, we were seated next to a couple of squealing couples... it's really too bad, it's so distracting. i won't go back even though the food is excellent.",5
"This was our second visit to Quality Meats, but it will definitely not be our last.  My husband and I were seated promptly at a smallish table for two along a banquette - fortunately the tables were not too close together.  We started with a charcuterie and cheese plate that was really outstanding, and served with some really delicious bread.  Next, a crab cake that may have been the best one I've ever had.  The crab meat was in plump pieces and held together with just enough bread crumbs to keep it from falling apart.  Beautifully browned and juicy. We also shared the fennel and apple salad, both shredded into a lovely slaw that was tangy and vibrant. Amazingly, we still had room for our entrees - filet for me, baby back ribs for my husband, with a side of crispy potatoes.  I really thought I might burst but it was all too delicious to leave and we had no place in our hotel or our schedule for leftovers. My steak was perfectly medium with a lovely char on the outside, served with a nicely spicy steak sauce on the side (which also tasted great with the crispy potatoes). Ribs were very tender.  Had to pass on dessert!",1
"Great meat, great steak.  Quality Meat indeed.  Funnily enough, I actually like the dry aged italian bistecca at their sister restaurant down the block, quality italian.",5
"Perfect 30th Birthday dinner for my son-  Grilled Bacon peanut butter w/ Jalapeno is a must try! Rib eyes were perfect, creamed spinach best , I've ever had! 5 star!",5
Thanks for giving us an incredible dining experience.,5
Birthday dinner. This is my favorite steakhouse so I know the food is always good. Although this time the service was not quite as attentive as it has been in the past. The server seemed a little distracted and rarely checked in on us. I’d still come back as this usually never happens when I come here.,4
"The food, ambiance and service was fantastic. Will return!",5
"David from Sunnyside was spot on!! Great meal, great wine and a terrific server made the night more than enjoyable.",5
"Did not disappoint.  Food and service (Sarah) was excellent and it was great talking to Orlando.  The kind of experience one would expect from a nice steakhouse.  There may be a few throughout the country but I wouldn't let that deter you, it's fantastic.",5
We had an excellent meal.. very good service.. the food was great... definitely coming back on our next trip to NYC,5
We always enjoy a visit to Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steak House when in New York City.  Seems getting a reservation becomes more of a challenge each time we try.  Be patient and a reservation will come available.  Steaks always done to perfection.  Another good meal enjoyed at Del Frisco's,5
Dinner was fantastic. We were sat on time and the service was excellent,5
We were wonderfully surprised and pleased with our immediate seating.  Our waiter was incredible with suggestions and knowledge of the menu.  All of our entrees were prepared to perfection. Our son is an executive chef and has taught us how to understand the fine points of various types of beef and your resturant  was the best!!,5
Service was great and ok food phenomenal. Thank you for the experience.,5
"It was a great dining experience! The views of the city are beautiful! The food was excellent, and the service was superb!",5
Great food and service,5
Manny and Chris went out of their way to give us the best experience possible! What an amazing team!,4
We ate here on a Saturday night.  They were actually very nice to seat us 1 1/2 hrs ahead of time because of our schedule change.  The restaurant was extremely busy.  We had a great waiter who managed our table and two others who were larger parties.  Food was well prepared.  We did have an issue with a steak being overcooked and they gladly took it back and prepared a new one according to order.,5
"More than 8 different staff members catered to us . Peter our waiter was informative, helpful and a pleasure for us.",5
"Excellent service, extremely accommodating to my gluten free toddler.",5
Service was excellent.  Our server Chris/Christian was outstanding and would recommend he be requested when dining at this location.,5
Nailed it!!! The steak was done perfectly (bone in filet) and the sides were a hit,5
Food was delicious and exceptional service.,2
We had theatre tickets and they were very mindful to get us out in time,4
"Not my personal favorite for the steaks, service was superb .",2
"we had very good appetizers, great steaks and side dishes. The service was professional and welcoming",5
Nothing special here... Very expensive for a “rush rush” experience. Our steaks were not cooked as ordered and had so much spice on them the meat flavors were indiscernible. Service was poor.,4
"This remains to be one of my favorite restaurants!  I love the lively atmosphere, the professionalism and friendliness of staff, and  we can’t forget the delicious steaks!  Actually, all the food is delicious.   The oysters are always fresh, the wine list is superb, The  bone in ribeye is my favorite,  the lobster mac & cheese is sinful, and  last but not least my two favorite desserts are the butter cake and the lemon cake!   Make sure you come hungry!",5
"HAVE DINED THERE MANY TIMES OVER THE PAST 15 YEARS. STEAKS NOT UP TO PAR. STEAK COATED WITH SPICES THAT OVERWHELMED THE FLAVOR  OF THE MEAT. STEAK STRINGY. HAD THE BONELESS NY STRIP. ORDERED BLACK & BLUE (VERY RARE) CAME THAT WAY, BUT THE INSIDE WAS NOT WARM. IT WAS VERY COLD. SHOULD NOT BE THAT WAY. CREAMED SPINACH HAD MORE CREAM THEN SPINACH. HARD TO TASTE THE SPINACH. MASHED POTATOES WERE DRY.   WILL NOT CONSIDER A RETURN. TOO MANY OTHER STEAK JOINTS IN THE CITY. AND RIGHT OVER THE BRIDGE IS OF COURSE THE BEST IN THE COUNTRY, PETER LUGER.",4
Anniversary and it was amazing.,5
Food good as usual. But waitstaff became distracted as the restaurant became less busy and we were left with dirty plates for 20 mins and had trouble getting waiter’s attention for dessert and check which we had to take together since we were now late.,5
"Great food! A point of excellence is the wine list, Amazing!!",5
Great experience!,4
"Because of the time of year, it was very loud and squished, but that didn't stop the service and food from being amazing, timely and overall a great experience! And the staff was very accommodating to our handicap member despite the crowd!!! Well worth the money!!!!",5
"WAS WITH A GROUP OF 8 AND TABLE SETTING WAS CRAMPED, OTHERWISE EXCELLENT FOOD AND SERVICE WAS GOOD.",4
Thomas was a great server. He made some great recommendations and never made us feel rushed.  Glad to have him wait on us for our first visit. We will be back.,5
Was a good experience just felt like everyone was squeezed in. Minimal room to walk between tables. Neighboring tables way to close. Felt like sardines in a can.,1
Always delicious at Del Frisco’s. Had the bone-in ribeye this time..a 10! Love this place. Thanks again to our waiter who was outstanding.,5
"We had a horrible experience at this restaurant.  Our waitress greeted us at the table, took our order. and then brought us our check.  No follow-up, ice team refills, how's your dinner, nothing.  The food was good, however, we requested our steaks medium well and medium.  Both steaks were rare in the center and all we could eat was around the edge of the steaks.  A very expensive and horrible experience.  In addition, they will not respond to my written customer complaint that I send via their website.  The Del Frisco's is certainly not what we have experienced in Houston.  This was our experience.",5
"Del Frisco's made my friend's birthday very memorable. I had to make a reservation, but it's expected when you dine where the food and service is perfection. Our steaks were cooked as ordered. The mashed potatoes and asparagus were delicious. Our drinks were never empty. I will definitely eat here again when I visit NYC!",5
It was my first time for lunch and I really liked it. We shared a crab cake to start and the chicken and kale salad was delicious.,5
Excellent steakhouse!  Our waiter James was extremely attentive and professional! Just perfect!,4
We were a party of three and Del Frisco's did not disappoint.  The steak was delicious as well as the appetizers.  Service was outstanding!  We will keep coming back!,4
Food was great. Reasonably proced for a 2 michelin star restaurant.  However service and attitude of waiters was definitely sub par.,4
"The food is acceptable but no more than this,  it does not justify the price.",3
Amazing. Favorite restaurant in the city.,5
"Had a great tasting menu here for lunch. Was reasonably priced, and efficient (5 dishes). Great view of central park, and the dining room was completely packed for lunch!",5
"Wonderful service. Great Ambience. Excellent Food! We got the Crudo, octupus, Fusilli & Gnochetti and the Scallops.  Everything was delicious and this restaurant is very worthy of being Michelin Starred!",5
"Terribly disappointed. So many good restaurants in the city and I had one opportunity to show my foodie savvy skills and chose Marea. Close to our hotel and Michelin star rated, how could I go wrong?",3
"Well the food was below sub par. Yes that means below-below average. I had to choose the bone marrow and octopus fusilli due to so many rave reviews. And yes it was good, but maybe I eat at too many fantastic restaurants because it did not knock my socks off like it did so many other reviews. It wasn't mouth watering amazing. If you are looking for fresh fantastic pasta, don't choose Marea, there are much better choices. .......oh and I had to send it back once because it arrived cold the first time. ",3
"***And here was the worst part of the night. My boyfriend ordered the parmesan truffle risotto special. He received the most bland tasteless moosh of risotto. NO flavor. NONE. Then they ask if you want some truffle sprinkled on the bland moosh. Which is expected since it WAS called Parmesan TRUFFLE risotto. We made the best of the night with two great bottles of wine but when the check came, the RISOTTO was $150 dollars on it's own. ",5
That was not our total...that was only for the Risotto. $150 dollars for ONE entree that was tasteless. Let that sink in and make reservations elsewhere. ,5
"To be fair, we did receive great service and they have a great wine list.",3
We recently needed a lunch spot in Midtown to go to while we were in Manhattan.  We had been to Marea on a few previous occasions. This lunch was slightly lower quality than I remembered but it could have been our choices or just an off-day for the staff.  Great location.,4
"Great food.  Friendly, polite, attentive, and professional staff.   We had the Dover Sole fish, it was perfect!",5
Food....Service....and wine great. Wonderful atmosphere.  Good for 2 or large party.  The oysters are the best & we eat them everywhere.  East Coast. West Coast & Europe.  We each had something different. Everything was excellent.  So good going back next week with other friends.,5
the host was very rude and seemed to be wanting a big tip to get a decent table,5
waited 15 minutes before a server showed up and had to have the manager take over the meal service,1
food is good but not great and very overpriced,5
"The service is excellent and very professional. Portions are small, so you may want to take advantage of the 4 course prifixe at $109.  The pastas are interesting but the sauces are complex - no marinara or bolognese here.",5
"The food was awesome, great place",5
Excellent.  Try the lobster with burrata.,4
"Always wondeful , great for lunch or dinner. The staff is attentive, professional and friendly. The menu is interesting with so many wonderful selections , it is hard to choose, but we have only experienced delicious  whatever are choice may be!",5
"Ambience was great, the space is gorgeous, but very disappointing food. Plating was incredible, but the flavours were often either too muddled or too discordant.",5
Every single dish I had was amazing and the service was great. I highly recommend the Astice antipasti and the Fusili Pasta.,5
Superb!  Best NYC meal this trip!  The food and staff were absolutely perfect! I would highly recommend!,5
Fantastic as always. Marea is always a must-stop anytime I’m in the city. Service is top notch and the food is always perfect. Definitely an experience. We flew from Texas to meet old friends from San Francisco and had to show them some of the best Italian that you can have anywhere in the world.,5
"Very nice ambiance and quaint atmosphere with good service. The grilled octopus was excellent. The Tagliolini was solid with simple ingredients, but nothing out of this world.",5
"While I came here for lunch, I once walked by at night where the swanky bar is in full action with nice lighting. It would be a great spot for a romantic dinner and/or drinks.",5
"Just fabulous.  Food, service and value for lunch.",5
Food was very delicious and space was wide and pleasant. Pastas were reallly my best I had in NYC.,4
Wonderful flavors and atmosphere!  Service  was first rate.,5
One of our favorites terrific fish selections and pasta ,5
Great wine selection ,4
Sean great a lot front desk ,5
Never fails to please,3
"This was my first time at Maria. My son recommended it since he had eaten there during the summer. The restaurant is beautiful! The food was outstanding. I love fish and the seafood dishes I had were great. The pasta specialty--fusilli with octopus--was great too. I am not usually an octopus fan but I was persuaded to try it and I liked it. The deep red wine sauce really added to the flavor and the cookies octopus was a inventive touch. Wine list was so large that I asked the sommelier for assistance. He was excellent--asking about my budget and then recommending several choices from several areas of Italy. The choice was perfect. Very highly recommend, but it is very expensive. If you want a great meal for a special occasion I recommend it highly.",5
Our experience at Marea was excellent!  Our waiter could not have been more personable and  knowledgeable.  And the food was delicious!   We definitely recommend this restaurant to others!,4
Just simply fantastic. We have been here four times and it gets better each time.,5
Boston Couple,4
"Best seafood I have had. Try the seafood soup. It is excellent   Our service was slow though. And, we were not there at a busy time.",5
Food was great but they threw out my left overs... wish I didn't leave as good a tip!lol,5
"We pick MAREA always for some important beautiful occasions since it would NOT deceive our expectaions.  This was a birthday dinner for my dear friend, Heidi and my daughter who turned to be a teenager.  They enjoyed food, time and services. Thank you-",5
"Excellent service, and food cannot find enough good restaurants.  Frequent Del Frisco's always a great experience.",5
Solo me retrasaron una hora mi reserva,5
"Party of 5 and we asked for quick service as we had a show to attend. The food was excellent and the service was fast. The rib eye was one of the very best that I have had. The onion rings where huge and sweet. Skillet potatoes, broccoli where all fantastic. I am definitely going back.",5
Celebrated my daughter's 21st Birthday. GREAT choice. Food was excellent.,5
Great experience! Wonderful ambiance! Outstanding service! Sensational food!,5
Just the BEST!!!,5
We all enjoyed our meal and the service was great. The manager made sure we were all happy and enjoyed our meal and made our experience that much better.,5
"This is one of my favourite ristos in Manhattan! The VIP (pineapple infused vodka) is DANGEROUS - BEWARE! However, it is delicious, as well as their steaks and everything else. Don't forget to have a slice of their Lemon Cake, the house specialty! Bon appetit!",2
"Overpriced and pretentious. And the 1970's ""funk"" music was annoying and intrusive.",5
"How lucky are we to live so close to Del Frisco's! Our first visit with teenage son & friend in tow. WOW ! Peter is a gem of a waiter...we'll be asking for him always...he is a professional with an engaging personlity. The food for each of us was outstanding!!!!!!! Meat, fish, appetizers-- all fresh and delicious. LOVED the energetic ambiance. Can't wait to return again, may try lunch too. Thank you to Peter.",5
"We loved eating at Del Frisco's. It was our anniversary and they made everything so special, including a free gigantic piece of delicious cake and delicious champagne. The food was delicious and service was amazing. My steak was a little more rare than I like it and they took it away and cooked it more right away and even brought us a fresh order of our sides with the steak the second time so that everything was warm together.",5
My dining experience was awesome! My waitress name was Saundra and she was very helpful and attentive.. maginificent. She also made great recommendations for wines and desserts. The food was delicous never could have imagined. I have been recommending it to all my friends and family.,5
The food was amazing and delicious. I am already dying to go back.,3
"Not impressed at all.I had higher expectations on the food. I had the 8oz filet, my boyfriend had the bone-in 16oz which was double the price because the waiter said the bone-in gives it 50% more flavor. When we got the steaks we both tried them and the taste was about the same. Another thing that disappointed me was that I ordered my steak medium and my boyfriend medium-well and we got the opposite so he didn't enjoy his $60 steak medium cooked. We ordered chatoue potatoes and baked potato. The baked potato was descent enough, the chatoue potato had way to much condiments/spices that I barely tasted the potato itself.This was a highly recommended steakhouse that's why we chose to dine there while our visit in NYC.Not worth what we paid for",5
"Great food, wonderful but not overbearing service. Overall and fabulous experience! We'll be back for sure.",5
"The service, food and atmosphere was great! The staff was very attentive! we can't wait to go back! 5 stars!",5
"Excellent! Went to New york for my wife's birthday. Had reservations for 11:15 pm after a show. Got seated on time, great service, great view, great food. Had the crab cakes, 8 oz filt and augrauten poatatoes with lemon cake for dessert. All were fantastic.",5
GREAT FOOD! BEST STEAKHOUSE IN NY!,5
"Del frisco's was very good. They seated us in a little room in the back where there was no view, but we were meeting up with old friends so didn't really care. If we had been entertaining clients or other guests, we would have asked for a different table. The food was very good, overpriced as usual but that's expected at a New York steakhouse. The atmosphere is better than most. All in all a great evening.",5
I researched various restaurants for our pre-theater dinner and had read very good reviews about Del Frisco's. I'm happy to say the reviews were right. We had an excellent experience and I can't think of another restaurant that could have compared to the food and service offered at Del Frisco's. Our waitor was friendly and prompt and provided amazing service. The appetizers and sides were delicious and the steaks were amazing; prepared exactly to our liking. I would HIGHLY recommend Del Frisco's and will return the next time we're in New York.,5
"Amazing food, excellent service, and fantastic table! Thanks MJ Blige for the reco (published in a major magazine)",3
"Heard great things going in, but was very dissappointed with the actual steak. The service was great, but the steak was over cooked and chewy. For a $65 ribeye, I would atleast expect it to be cooked right. If you want it done medium, you better ask for it medium rare.. a cardinal sin for a steakhouse. To top things off.. I ordered a $20 scotch after dinner.. and received the smallest jigger of scotch I ever received. I've been to other steak houses in the city and would rank Del Frisco's towards the bottom.",4
"Sincerely,",5
A very dissappointed patron!!,5
"Great food, Great Service, Great atmosphere!",3
Love this place it's always great!!!,3
Our server made the evening wonderful!,5
"Great place, can be a little pricy, but a great part of the new york scene, huge operation.",3
Too much black pepper on filet mignon. Could not taste meat almost at all,5
Great place to eat and to soak up the atmosphere of the city. Very vibrant bar and scene. Wonderful service and food. The best.,5
"food was ok nothing you couldn't do at home. It was way over priced, but the cheesecake was very good.",5
32oz Longbone Ribeye was excellent,5
"Food was excellent, everyone at the table was content! Wine list great and service very good. All together very happy with our experience.",5
Absolutely the best steak in Manhattan. The only area of improvement I would recommend is finding ways to reduce the decibel level - just a little. :-),4
"It's not cheap, so just make your peace with that. Once you do, sit back, relax for two hours and really enjoy an outstanding experience. We go every year for my birthday and everything from the appetizers to the desserts is exceptional every time.",5
"Consistently impressed. Service is great, food is fantastic, ambiance is lovely. The price limits it to a special occasions only place for us, but is by no means unreasonable. We often look for special occasions we can celebrate at Del Friscos.",4
"The food was very good but we were a bit disappointed. The DelFrisco website said that they still had the pre-fixed/pre-theater menu that included a salad, entree and dessert - but when we got to our table our waiter informed us that it included the entree and dessert only and that we needed to buy the salad separately, which we did. I'd still consider coming back, but without the old pre-fixed menu it is less likely.",4
We were very pleased with our experience. Great service!,4
We had a short time period for our luncheon meeting before our flight back to Tampa. The server was extraordinary in helping us have a productive meeting in a quiet section of the restaurant and catching our flight home.,4
I'm a regular here. But tonight steaks were especially salty. Not sure why.,5
Good for date,5
"Food  was great, but service was okay. It was offensive our waiter started to clean the floor before we left the table.",4
Great service and the food was excellent.,5
Absolutely amazing food. The staff are extremely generous and kind to you. Everything was perfect. A little pricey but I was ready to pay a high bill before even getting there. By hey.. what do you expect for a high end steakhouse in the middle of NYC. ,5
Al in all 1000% worth it,5
"We went during restaurant week. Even though it was clear that we were not business men on an expense account we were treated as if we were.  The food was excellent and the service was spectacular. It was an exceptionally good value due to the restaurant week pricing, But there was a reasonable business man's lunch on the regular menu",5
This was my 7th time here but it was my best friends 1st time . She loved the decor all the way down to the dessert. We were at a great table with the best view of all the buildings along avenue of America’s (6th Avenue) including radio city music hall. Me and her booked our reservation through open table for restaurant week but when we arrived we were notified that we could not order food from the restaurant week prefix menu because it wasn’t available for dinner (only lunch). I was a little discouraged because that wasn’t explained on the website but our waitress managed to fix the minor issue and offer us something close to it. She was very nice & personable. We recieved a 3 course meal for $60 each (well worth it). We had Cesar and their house salad which had the most delicious avocado ranch dressing on it topped with a well done slab of cured brown sugar smoked bacon on it. We also had the salmon & fillet midallions with the famous Lobster mac and cheese for our main course. For the desert we had a creamy chocolate mousse and cheesecake that was to DIE FOR!! The service was phenomenal. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for 5 star quality service and delicious food. It is a little on the expensive side but it’s worth every penny. Thank you for making my best friends 1st experience here special. We’ll be back soon❤️,5
Absolute best as always,4
7 big guys and a cramped table upstairs in the corner by the window...only complaint! Management should’ve been able to help us out somehow...food and service were excellent!,1
"Service was awful!!!  Waitress kept claiming she was ""sick"".  Cut of filet mignon had fatty pieces and it was super small.    I would not recommend this place at all.",5
I have eaten here many times. Back in 2008 we had our sons graduation party after he finished his West Point degree.  Very special place for our family!  This time it was our 30th wedding anniversary!  Received a signed card from the staff ❤️ Can’t say enough good things about Del Frisco’s!! A must for every visit to NYC!!,5
"I always enjoy me meals at delfrisco, they have the best steak.  I took my friend there in honor of her retirement.  We had the best time ever.  My friend was really impressed and I'm sure she will return as i will.",4
"Overall, a wonderful experience, as usual!",5
"At Del Frisco’s, I look forward to the steaks. The steaks are  expertly cooked to your requested temperature. For Rib eyes, I recommend medium to caramelize the fat just a bit more or in general medium rare. The service was engaging but not intrusive. My water glass was never empty... Excellent. Thus is s must go to impress or to celebrate in style.",4
A good experience with restaurant week!,5
Mashed potatoes and cheese cake were delicious!,5
"For fellit steak, I think it's in normal standard.",5
The staff was professional and knowledgeable about the menu.  Great ambiance!,4
Celebrated birthday and watched the Superbowl.  Great table setting near bar area.  Waitress/staff very attentive.  Presented me with a beautiful and delicious birthday desert.  Thank you Del Frisco's.,5
One of our favorite restaurants! Ashley our waitress was excellent and spot on with her recommendations and service.  The only draw back was that the restaurants was very cold and we could've used a little heat.  Other than that zero complaints.,4
I have going to del frisco for the last 15 years..Love the steak and crab cake.,3
We ran a little late and they held the table for us even though we were about 5 minutes past their 15 minute grace period. They were quite busy but accommodated our late arrival and we were directed to their upstairs bar where we waited about 10 minutes before our table was ready. The cocktails were great and it was nice that there was a large TV upstairs. I made a reminder to myself to possibly return for their bar and bar menu during baseball season. ,5
"The service was spot on and the food was very good. We were not rushed to go through the courses and we were not pestered by over anxious waitstaff either. We had the bacon for an appetizer which we highly recommend if you like smoked meat. The wedge was nice, but what you would normally expect  but it was exactly what I wanted it to be; crisp lettuce, chunky blue cheese, and crunchy thick bacon. The onion rings were great, not too oily and they reheated nicely the next day. The cauliflower was good, but a touch too ""funky"" for me to go with the dry aged steak. Both our steaks were cooked perfectly to medium rare. The chocolate souffle at the end was overcooked and more of a flour-less chocolate cake than a souffle but was still tasty.  We brought our own bottle of wine for a $50 cork fee, which was great considering there are some competing restaurants in the city that do not allow outside bottles. Overall it was a fantastic experience and we will definitely be returning.",5
"I had made a reservation over a month ago for my boyfriends birthday. The food was very good but our seating area wasn’t. We were shoved back in a side room, away from the true ambiance of the Del Frisco experience, which made for a less than overwhelming experience.",4
"My visit was for a Special Occasion, this is not the spot for a Quiet Conversation or Romantic Evening.  We were seated close to the Bar side of the restaurant which could have been part of the problem , but the restaurant was aware that my reservation was for a special anniversary and could have seated us in a different section of the restaurant.  The restaurant did give us a Celebration Desert plate at N/C.",5
"Consistently one of the very best steak places in Manhattan.  The steaks for our party of four were perfectly cooked, tender, and well seasoned.  The sides were similarly outstanding.  Always a fun evening at DelFrisco’s.",5
"My boyfriend and I had an unbelievably amazing experience there on Saturday 2/3/2018. I can't wait to come back. The food, drinks, and service all exceeded our already high expectations. I can't celebrate the wait and kitchen staff enough. What a dream the whole experience was.",5
"Food was phenomenal, service was a bit stuffy. Great people watching view from the second floor",5
I brought my friend for her birthday.  ,2
Everything from ordering food to paying was a great experience. ,5
In my opinion I wouldn’t go any where else to have a superb steak dinner.,5
"Beautiful setting, delicious food, attentive and knowledgeable waiter!! A bit pricey but the total experience made it worth every penny! We mentioned that it was my sons birthday and the waiter surprised us with a birthday cake/dessert platter for him, big enough to share!! So sweet!",5
Great Steakhouse~Highly recommend!,5
Always great,5
The runner brought our bacon and prime rib to table next to us. When they carried plates. The back of plate touches the steak. Unacceptable.,4
"Great birthday experience, everything tasted amazing. Service by Sara was awesome.",4
"we wanted a great steakhouse on a one daytrip from Washington, D.C. Based on the reviews, I selected Del Frisco's and unfortunately, we were disappointed. The prices are outrageous which was expected but the food really did not live up to the hype. We ordered filet mignon on the bone at the recommendation of our waitress. And then all agreed that we have definitely eaten better steaks elsewhere: Peter Lugers, Ruth's Chris and the Capitol Grille all spring to mind. The asparagus side dish was absolutely inedible, wooden in fact, and I dont mean al dente. The chateau potatoes were just okay. The waitress asked us not to order the bread pudding because she had so many complaints. Is this really worth over $400 for a dinner for three?",5
"All about the atmosphere - beautiful interior and view, a little loud, but pleasant. Decent food, drinks; very nice wine list. Attentive and friendly wait staff. Beware of the hot plate trick which may over-cook your steak. Also, as is quite typical in many east coast steak houses, your cut will come finished drowning in butter unless otherwise requested.",2
"If you like steaks and/or seafood, this is your restaurant. The food is fantastic, the service is wonderful, the wine list is huge, and you’ll leave full and satisfied. Yes - it’s expensive...but - in my mind - worth the price.",5
"A very nice place. Let’s start off with they had our reservation and no waiting. We were seated right away with a nice view. Del Frisco is spacious so no one was on top of each other and me and my other was able to have a conversation. The bread was delicious crispy in the outside and soft on inside and hot. The butter was nice and fluffy. We ordered the oysters on half shell and king crab legs for appetizer, the wagyu tomahawk chops and Brussels sprout for dinner and chocolate soufflé cake, espresso double shot and tea.  The oyster and crab legs was fresh. The first problem was the wagyu tomahawk chop was crispy outside (nice) but when you cut into it there was way too much fat. We told the waiter (I think his name was Joel) he brought over one of the manager who saw how fat it was and offered another steak but by then we were a little turn off so they told us it would not be charge. We felt bad and wasn’t trying not to pay so we decided to order a dessert. Problem number two was the dessert came and no espresso or tea till after the dessert was done. We found the dessert dry like it had been sitting a while because the molten chocolate had already dried into the cake and wasn’t flowing any chocolate from the middle. But Joel was nice enough to get the dessert, espresso and tea taken off also. So not the best on the food this time but the service was great and really nice of them to take off the bill everything that was not great. The bill came to about $135 and we gave Joel a $65 tip for trying. We definitely will be back to try something else and hopefully it will be better and get to pay the entire bill. Thank DelFriscos for the great service and see you soon!",5
"My experience whenever I go to Del Frisco’s is beyond amazing. Their service is amazing, their food is amazing. Everything about them is just amazing! I’m always raving to my friends about them how great this place is.",5
"Best steak I ever had. Jeffrey, our waiter, was fantastic. Will definitely come again next time we are in NYC.",5
"This restaurant was a memorable experience! From the wait staff to the food, it was perfect. Highly recommended.",5
Service with Heather very good-professional and attentive,3
Caesaar salad very good .Spinach Supreme was delicious,4
Huge wine list but overpriced,3
Steaks were overcooked and the strip was not worthy of a $45.00 steak,5
I'll stick to Ruths or Capital Grill,5
"The food was excellent, the wine list was great. We sat downstairs near the bar so it was a bit noisy. But overall the experience very enjoyable.",5
"Had a reserveration. We were on time. We were taken immediately to our table. A very nice table and we were assigned a very good waiter. Excellent service. We skipped starters and ordered lunch. 1 salmon, 1 tuna, 1 red snapper (special) and 1 steak. The meals came out. My tuna was cooked to order. However, it was clear it was fired before the other dishes. The tuna was cold. The server who brought the plate to the table told me to be careful the plate was hot. What a joke. The plate was mildy cool. The salmon was not cooked to order. My client ordered medium rare and got a cooked through dry salmon. The red snapper did look good. The steak was also good. So 50-50 on the entrees. As for the sides mediocre",5
Had some visitors in from Germany and they thought it could have been the best steak and wine combo they've ever had- Cajun rib eye and Caymus 05!!,4
Always a favorite. It never disappoints. One of the best steakhouses in NYC. Definitely will return next time I'm in NYC.,4
"Amazing meal & dining experience. The best meal we have ever had - was worth every penny, cant fault it at all.",5
"Friends of ours highly recommended this restuarant so we thouhgt we would give it a try to help celebrate my partners 40th - what was actually delivered exceeded our expectations at almost every level - the surroundings were informal enough to be comfortable and relaxed, the bar service was quick and friendly, the table service was excellent, and the food !! wow - I have never had steak like it - the crab cake starters were fantastic and everything was well presented. Even the special touch of having a pre-oredered and specially sourced bottle of champagne, on ice and poured as we sat down added to the overall experience. This should be a ""must eat at"" venue for any visitor to NYC.",5
"Excellent, the food was great. I got a Prime Ribeye, cooked medium rare and it was truly delectable, so tender, it melts in your mouth. The side dishes were also good. I never really liked califlower, but the califlower and brie side dish was excellent.",5
Great dinner. Steaks were top notch and side dishes had an interesting twist which made them different from other steakhouses. Very busy and loud when we arrived but when we were seated we were put in a quieter room which was nice.,5
Wine list was extensive but also pricey.,5
Service was outstanding and the food divine--exceptional cosmopolitans!,4
Extremely good service and food.,5
"Excellent service and food was perfectly prepared. They made the meal fit into our allotted time frame for dinner (which was in between Broadway shows), and did not make it feel rushed, harried or inconvenient.",5
We enjoy eating here every time we come into the city. Looking forward to coming again soon.,5
Fantastic steaks...with a steep price. Excellent wine list with a few treasures,5
"Check in was frenetic, no sign of the recession here, but the staff handled the volume efficiently. I waited about 5 minutes for my reserved table, less than expected, given the number of people waiting for tables and how crowded it was. They clearly have sufficient staff to handle the crowds. Thankfully we were seated in a quiet corner towards the back where we could hear ourselves speak, otherwise it would have been difficult to carry on a conversation to the crowd noise. Waitstaff was very friendly and attentive. They recommended the crabcakes, which were outstanding, and the ribeye steak, also outstanding. Thankfully they also recommended the DelFrisco cabernet at $60, which drank as if it were a higher price point; great value.",5
"I requested a quiet table, and considering how loud steakhouses are, I was assigned a table which was not as loud as it could be. Was very impressed with the server, PJ, who told us the specials and quoted the cost of each item. That was very much appreciated. All in all, it was a wonderful dinner. I want to come back again!",5
I usually go there for important client lunches. The menu selection is great. The service is excellent and they do not rush you out. You should make a reservation and i have never had to wait longer than five minutes upon arrival. The noise level is satisfactory. I always recommend to friends.,3
"The food at Del Frisco's is first rate, as is the location, situated right in the middle of Rockefeller Center. The spaciousness of the place calms down the boisterous diners and fast paced service. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and amiable, and gave us free champagne for our anniversary. Not the cheapest place around (though I guess not the most expensive either), definitely worth the price point.",5
What to say? We fly from Eastern Europe to South America. The only place that comes close to Double Eagle NYC is Ft. Worth.,2
"This is what sets the standard in not only fine dining, but is the Platinum standard for steaks, atmosphere and service. It doesn't come any better than this. Well, except Ft. Worth's steak barely edges out NYC, but the view from the upper level over looking Radio City Music Hall trumps just about anything. Service and attendants were beyond words and very friendly, but professional when needed to be. Great wine and dessert.",4
"If you are within 100 miles of NYC, this is the place to be.",5
"I have to give Boston an honorable mention, we love it as well and will be going back soon next trip up there.",4
"I have been a long time customer of Del Frisco's and have been to many restaurants in NYC. In my opinion, the best porterhouse in NYC and the service is great, the host gave my party to have a drink at the bar or sit right away, and our waiter was very attentive.",3
the steaks were good and the service was outstanding,5
"Upstairs was closed for private party, so dining on mail level adjacent to the bar was far too noisy to enjoy a conversation. Food and service were at expectation (very good)",4
"Absolutely superb filet mignons, tasty sides, attentive but not pushy service. A first rate dinner.",5
There is a good bar crowd and the food is delicious. Service is excellent. The waiter was kind enough to give us a complimentary side dish as my lamb chops were not cooked well done as ordered. I thought that was a great customer service.,5
We had a wonderful bottle of wine but the quality of our food was mediocre at best and nowhere near the price we paid for it. This restaurant is way overpriced.,4
"We were in from out of town and wanted a great italian place that wasn't completely traditional. We had a great meal, fantastic service, and I would go back the next time I am in NYC.",5
Was able to visit both Qualty Meat and Quality Italian within two days.....Very good service....Had steak both nights...Had to...,4
Going back ASAP.......,5
"My Fiance and I came here and just shared the Chicken Parm for two and had a glass of wine...It's AMAZING - comes out looking like a pizza...best chicken parm I've ever had. It's enough to feed 4 people! Great service and atmosphere, would definitely recommend it.",2
"White wine served at room temperature (I didn't complain, but when server asked if I wanted another, and I told her yes, but it was not cold, she shrugged and walked away and didn't offer to find a chilled bottle) , fatty, undercooked chop, and when I turned over my steak, a hair. I spent an hour listening to the guy next to me complain that his chicken parm was soggy and didn't look like the photo on some website, first to his wife, then to the server, then to the manager. Manager sent out a dessert, as a comp, that I didn't choose and didn't want. They have a pretty room, but something is off, and it isn't just the food. I think this place is run by a bunch of kids, although people try to be nice.",4
Had wonderful brunch at Quality Italian; the eggplant benedict was amazing; egg white frittata was no available and so dissapointed a few that wanted to order that. Bacon was crisp and airy with kale crisp which was amazing;,2
"Beautiful surroundings, great location; cant wait to go back for dinner.",3
"I was most disappointed with the service that evening that was provided to our party of six. The restaurant automatically added a hefty service charge on the total bill, which I understand is a norm; however it should not serve as a reason to lack of incentive to take of your guests.",5
"Its a great atmosphere, bustling place, but the food just isnt as good as Quality Meats I think. I still go regularly to the bar, whcih is good and the staff are great.",4
"Had dinner here recently and thoroughly enjoyed it. Although the chicken parm looked amazing, we opted for the special surf & turf for 2 which consisted of a bone in filet and lobster fra diavolo - both absolutely delicious! Our servers, Matt and Jessie, were very attentive and helpful. Would definitely recommend this to a friend and we will be going back.",5
the swordfish was wonderful and was as the kale salad and broccili rab,4
great wine list,5
would definitely again,5
amazing bread,3
Food was amazing especially the corn creme brule! The only complain would be the waitress was very pushy we like to have some wine have some appetizers and order dinner after a little she kept coming back asking if we were ready to order dinner after telling her we are just hanging out not yet.,5
Other than that the food was well worth it!! Will be going back.,2
"First time at rest. Got seated right away. Our waiter was very informative with specials and suggestions on menu. Food was great, had the chicken parma for 2, which was enough food for 4. Would definitely go back.",4
"little noisy, phenomenal service, great food",2
Love the bar with filling snacks to order and well poured cocktails.,4
"Dining upstairs feels like a second stop of a night out with a lively restaurant, great food.",2
Good for small groups or large.,5
"This place has great food - the Caesar salad was unique & excellent, the charred chicken was so tender I first thought it was uncooked (it wasn't) it was the most moist ever; really all was well done.",5
"But when we arrived the restaurant was practically empty (it is quite large), the Hostess tried to seat us far back next to a bus station. Not ok. After waiting for many others to be seated we ended up at a banquette on the other side of the same location- the same bus station & now the kitchen. There were many places to seat us. The table service was poor, they are nice but reach over to remove plates on a two top, leave water glasses empty, etc.",4
The one last thing I can say is that we were not rushed out which we did appreciate.,3
Where should I start!?!,3
"We arrive and everyone was very accomodating and friendly. We asked to be moved to another table and it was granted to us immediately. The decor and ambience was very romantic, adding to the special mood of the evening. We were first comers, recommended by a friend. We had strict instructions to order chicken parm and artichoke macherroni. When the food arrive the first thing we noticed was the presentation. This was not your ordinary baked chicken parmesan. The restaurant was able to shape it into a 12 inch pizza size, which we had seen on multiple tables. The waiter even cut the dish right in front of us as if it was pizza. Afterwards, he explained the experience of eating the dish. What an amazing unique dinner",5
"Appetizers were really good, but the pasta we ordered sucked. For a 30 dollar dishes i expected more. Overall my dish was almost inedible and way over seasoned. The dessert looked promising but it flopped as well being too heavy and over saturated. Would recommend the grilled octopus dish we had for the appetizer. The service was good.",5
We decided to stay in the City rather than deal with the weather and traffic and so decided too to stay on our block and try the newbie. We were amazed at how they transformed a Staples store into a chic eatery. Great job!,3
"The food was great and the most memorable part was the ricotta ice cream, part of my dessert. There were however some issues.",4
"We were seated next to an already occupied table when the entire place was empty. Our server tried to oversell us, and fortunately, we declined his recommendations and had more than enough food for the 2 of us. The wine we ordered, at the recommendation of the sommelier wasn't available but he made up for it by giving us a more expensive bottle at the same price.",5
Overall a positive experience.,4
We paid 200 usd for a dinner for 2. Nothing special. The meat was burnt.,5
I really like the Quality brand. This was my first time at Italian. Food was really good but not great. I expected great based on my experience at Quality Meats.,2
The service was weak and they acknowledged their weakness by serving us an app and side on the house. Nice when folks take responsibility for their poor service. I will be back. Everyone has an off night. It is how you handle the off nights that make people come back.,4
"Although I totally understand that they were busy, my husband and I waited over 20 minutes for our table to be ready. Excited for the food, nobody told us about the service. After being seated, we were offered water, but then it took another 10 minutes to be acknowledged by the waiter. 10 minutes after that we were able to put in our drink order. Another 10 minutes he came back and was able to answer our questions and was very knowledgeable and honest. The food was delicious, but it's nothing that you can't get somewhere else - for much cheaper. I should say that since my husband is a vegetarian, we did not get the chicken parm (i hear that's the draw), but i would be open to going back with a larger group to try it - if i wasn't paying.",4
"Had a fabulous dinner here the other night. Everything was great, grilled octopus to start but the Chicken Parm is to die for!!! It is out of this world!! Corn creme brulee was amazing, rigatoni with meatballs and zepole workshop so fun!! I can't wait to go back!!",5
I loved the service. They try hard to make you feel special.,4
"I took my 16 year old niece to NYC for a special weekend and Del Frisco's was everything and more that I expected. My request for a nice table with a view was granted, the service was amazing and my niece got to experience the 'flashlight'. I ordered the ribeye and my niece ordered the Filet. We both agreed that is was the best steak we had ever eaten. I would highly recommend Del Frisco's to anyone who wants to experience fine dining at its best.",2
"Food was overall solid, only complaint is the pricing on the side dishes. Crab bernaise for the filet mignon is a MUST TRY!! Waitress was so sweet, brought my boyfriend an AMAZING chocolate souffle cake for dessert (we were celebrating his birthday). Phenomenal. Absolutely will be back for my next special occasion.",4
"My wife and I love this place. We make this a must stop each time we visit NYC. We like the atmosphere (vibrant, loud but not overwhelming, and a great view of 6th Ave from the balcony). Usually the steaks are very good. This last time (9/17/10)my delmonico was pretty good and my wife's was pretty bad. My wife's was tough and not tasty, etc. I did not complain but should have (my mistake).",4
Not sure if we will return on the next trip. It's my wife's call and she was not happy.,5
One of our party was a vegan and the waiter took note of that and came back with a suggestion that the chef prepare a special off the menu item. It was prepared and excellent according to the person. The attention to detail was great.,5
"My boyfriend and I ate at QI the other evening and had been wanting to try it for a while since we both really enjoy it's sister restaurant, Quality Meats. We had a 9:30PM reservation on a Saturday and when we arrived our table was not ready. This was unfortunate but not unheard of in a trendy Manhattan restaurant on a weekend. However, our hostess apologized profusely and told us to have a seat at the bar and that our drinks would be on the house while we waited. I've been told to wait at the bar before, but never had several rounds of drinks comped for the inconvenience - that was a really nice touch. The rest of our meal was really enjoyable with great food and wine and attentive server. Will definitely be back!",4
"I had a 9:30 dinner reservation, but wasn't seated until after 10. After my second time inquiring about our table, the hostess got us free cocktails, but it was a little late for that. Once we were seated, the food came out quickly and was pretty good, but the service was just ok- I kept having to ask for my water glass to be filled and we weren't offered more bread, but our waitress tried. The part that bothered me most was that, at the end of the night, the restaurant staff was hovering around trying to get us to leave. They didn't seat us until 10 PM, so of course we were still eating quite late, and after waiting half an hour for my table, I didn't really appreciate the pressure. I would go back, but it wouldn't be first on my list.",3
"We are always scouting out restaurants to try for our annual long weekend in NYC. This restaurant lived up to everything I'd read about it. The atmosphere was elegant, the food was phenomenal, and the service was flawless. Highly recommend.",5
Consistently superb food with the highest quality ingredients. The only problem is that the numbers items you want to try is a multiple of what you can eat -- in a week!,5
To many different peoples coming to your table. ,5
Do smaller sections and ask them to stay in theirs. ,5
Thank you for attention and have a good day ..,5
Love this place. Staff and food was fantastic! I would totally come back here again.,4
"Yes, there are alternatives to pasta but here it is home-made and fantastic.  The lobster with burrata makes an excellent first course.",5
"Everything was a delicious. I just thought that the bread pudding dessert size was a two bite dish. Unusually small portion. However, I would definitely recommend this restaurant and go back.",3
"It was a wonderful dinner, in an outstanding restaurant! Great food and wine!",4
Been here a few times before and food was excellent. Unfortunately this night the food was below average and definitely not worth the value. Service is always above and beyond too bad I left wanting my money back,3
Food was absolutely delicious! Fantastic pasta and delicious desserts. ,5
Only one thing: they should stop using baby octopus ( polpo) in menu.,5
"For a Michelin 2 star restaurant I was shocked be the mediocrity of the food. The service was as attentive as it was ambivalent. Very consistent attention by the staff yet I never saw anyone smile unless they were speaking amongst themselves or to patrons they new by name. They appeared in all aspects to be merely going through the motions of service. We were given several complimentary items to try which I do truly appreciate. Unfortunately every one of them could have easily been duplicated by anyone with the slightest skill in the kitchen from scratch or who could read the heating instructions on the bag they came in. Half of the food was well seasoned but over cooked. The other half was cooked properly but highly over seasoned. On one particular plate that contained several fingerling potatoe pieces they ranged from overcooked to the point of falling apart on the fork to so undercooked they were snappy in the mouth. I still regret not sending one dish back that was nearly inedible from the over salting.  At a near $500 cost for two at a 2 star restaurant the food came no where close to meeting expectations. Perhaps it was an off night but the waiter beginning the evening with a bothered look on his face asking, ""Can I help you?"", after he passed us several times attending to his other tables instead of a ""Hello"", maybe introducing himself, or being at all welcoming probably did not help. Unfortunately the quality of the food exacerbated the unpleasantness of the overall experience. I will not be recommending or returning.",5
Muy bueno todo. Exeñente el Polipo. Muy buen y completa carta de vinos. El risoto y la pasta son muy sabrosos. Y para el final hay una buena variedad de grapas. Lo recomiendo,5
Excellent. A must go we visit every time we come to town,2
"Phenomenal restaurant, fantastic service, and amazingly good food!  So worth every penny you spend!!!  Just go and enjoy. . .",5
"Went for our one year anniversary. As usual, great service and amazing seafood, I had the halibut and my wife had the scallops and we split the bone marrow must get pasta. I thought the crudo was pretty average though.",5
Came from LA and decided to try fine dining in NYC. Found Marea to be over rated. Not sure how they got 2 Michelin stars. Presentation falls far short of pics on website. Had better tasting food from non Michelin rated restaurants.,3
Crudo & octopus appetizer was ok.,4
Black sea bass was slightly undercooked but tasted good w/ sauce. Halibut was little overcooked but ok.,5
Ice cream & sorbet dessert was poor.,4
Ambience was good and service was good in general.,4
Had difficulty understanding servers explaining the dish that was being served. Also waiter insisted that we ordered a drink which we didn't. Later came back to apologize that he confused drink order w/ table next to us. Left on sour note after disappointing food.,5
There are better restaurants which are less expensive.,4
"Decent food, great service.  Booked last minute for a weekday lunch.  The customers at the next table ordered the wrong dish.  The waiters handled the situation elegantly.",4
Spectacular food!!!..... very high priced but for a special occasion it is worth it,4
"The quality of food and service unfortunately dropped since the last time I have eaten there last year. Normally, it's one of my favorite spots but somehow this time it was not as good.",4
"Food is excellent, portions are small.  Service is excellent, two errors.",5
Catered to my friend's birthday wonderfully.,4
"Can't understand previous reviewers who say they left hungry. We had the four course prix fixe and with amuse bouche and chocolates after,we left stuffed. Food excellent, service was perfect. It is quite pricey though. For a special occaision, it's worth it.",4
"Excellent experience. We stopped  in afternoon, food is delicious, we have pre-fix menu, good food and service",5
I've heard great things about this restaurant and it didn't disappoint. The food and service was first-rate. I'm currently craving the Fusilli. I'd certainly go back.,5
"We dined here for a special occasion and the food was outstanding.  We enjoyed the tasting menu and every course was memorable especially the pastas.  We would have given the review 5 stars except the wait staff was sub par- several minor mistakes and inattention.  Even so, this would not stop us from dining there again since the food was so delicious.",5
Marea continues its excellence in all categories.  We have been going since it opened and have never been disappointed.,5
"Celebrating my son's birthday and he chose this place.  Being on Central Park South, I knew it would be expensive, so I was prepared for that.  We went with the Tasting Menu as suggested by others on Open Table reviews and it was fantastic.  We got six courses chosen by the Chef and we were pleased from appetizers to dessert.  All of the wait staff was so friendly and nice which is always important to us.  Only disappointment was the wine list.  We are not big wine drinkers and the cheapest bottle was $80.  Overall experience was good and I would consider going back for another special occasion.",5
"I would have given all 5 to this restaurant if it was not for where they seated us.  We had reservations, one of the first group to enter the place.  Yet they showed us behind the coulumns when they had playoff great tables open.  At my husband's request I did not ask to be moved.  The corner table which I would have preferred to be seated stayed empty the entire time we were there.  ",5
"Like most of the major steakhouses in town, be prepared to pay expense account prices ($35-55 depending on the cut). In comparing them, however, I think Del's delivers the most value for the money because of the quality of their steaks, the excellent service and the elegant and comfortable room and location.",4
Steak and veal chop slightly overdone,4
"Del Frisco is the first reservation we make everytime we visit Manhatten. We love the amazing steaks and the decadent mac and cheese! The huge windows with the view of the bustling streets outside is great. The service was fantastic. We've had great times as a couple, and in groups of 10. We will be back again and again... someday we may have room to try dessert?",5
"This is where you take your puffy meat-eating uncle for steak. Expensive, classic, nothing surprising for your everyday white table-clothed steak house. The wine is excellent.",3
"For 3 foodies, who love steak, our rating is simple.. beats out all the steak houses we have been to in the NY Area.",5
"Our first day in New York, coming from Europe, so after a long day we were not sure if our kids were staying awake during a 'midnight diner'. We were pleasantly surprised by the elegant atmosphere and the friendly staff. It was Father's day and the visitors were a mis of families and parties with adults. The food was great, they whine fine and the kids enjoyed their filet mignon. For my non-meat eating husband there was a good fish. Vegetable dishes were fresh and werved hot, without being cooked to far. We would go there again.",4
Went with the whole family for Father's Day- it's my father in law's all-time favorite restaurant. Excellent service- very helpful and friendly wait staff and sommelier (suggested a terrific wine). Fantastic crab cake and shrimp dish (the rest of the family loved their steaks). Brought 5-year old daughter along and it was fun and comfortable for her too.,4
The only steakhouse we go to in Manhattan as it has always been great!,5
Food and service were excellent!,5
"Приятное место с хорошим интерьером, сервис на уровне. Достаточно шумно, но не на столько, чтобы не слышать сидящих за одним столом. Меню не слишком разнообразное. Еда хорошего качества, но не выдающейся рецептуры, достаточно дорогая. Ужин на одного взрослого человека с алкоголем будет гарантировано стоить больше $100. В целом очень приятное место для посещения небольшой компанией.",4
"The food was excellent! The steak and onion rings were fantastic. I will definitely come back the next time I'm in NYC. My friend appreciated the birthday candle on the large portion of Lemon cake. Jeff, our server, was very good and personable. Thank You!",4
"Fabulous food, A+ service, and spectacular setting. It doesn't get much better than this.",5
"Always reliable but not great. Great steak, fair seafood, some good sides. Good choice for out of towners who are not very adventurous diners. Too loud to be really enjoyable.",3
"Overall, a good dining experience, although I will say that the quality has slipped a bit. This was my 7th or 8th time here...and I have noticed some slippage in the food preparation. I ordered my strip steak medium rare...and it came out medium well. A lady at the table next to ours ordered hers medium...and it was at best medium rare. The last time that I was there, the steak that I ordered (a ribeye) was also seriously over cooked. Combine this with a seriously overpriced wine list ($175 for a 2006 Cakebread Cab), and I will not be as enthusiastic to return in the future.",3
"Service was really good...the appetizers and dessert were also really good. However, this is a steak house....and they need to get that right.",5
"Staff was very attentive and the food was delicious the mac and cheese was delicious, I thought I was the best mac and cheese maker (smile), will definitely be back. Keep up the good work.",4
Food was great and so was service. Noisier than I expected and disappointed they did not offer fixed price menu for dinner.,5
Everything from the greeting from the hostess to the wait-staff service was first class and the food was perfectly prepared. I have eaten in many restaurants worldwide that are noted for their steaks and this is one of the best!,4
Really enjoyed our visit. From out of town and wanted to experience New York. We were not disappointed!,5
"I absolutely LOVE eating at Del Frisco's whenever I get the chance to head to NYC. This time was no exception, we had the 12oz. Maine Lobster and a Filet special with three different sauces, and it was spectacular. Definitely worth the price for special occasions.",5
"Absolutely my favorite steakhouse, if not my favorite restaurant in the city. I have been half a dozen times, each time right on the mark. Beats all the other big names, you should really give it a try.",4
"I have been to Del Frisco's several times for business and pleasure and enjoyed it, but.....",4
The lobster tails started out at 18oz then to 16oz and now 12oz...if that...,4
The crab cakes used to be better also...,5
I am not as impressed with the place as I used to be...,4
Need to find a replacement...,5
The dining experience was good. Waiter tried to push the expensive Kobe Steak a little to hard. Good for special occasion as it is very expensive.,5
The filet mignon was excellent! The oyster appetizer and fish special--not so much. Not what I expected. I thought it would be more upscale and was surprised to see others dressed so casually.,2
"My boyfriend took me here for dinner following my college graduation. From the minute we walked into the door, it was great. The hostess' were extremely nice to us and complimented us upon walking in and since we were early, they suggested us having a drink at the bar which we did. After that we were seated by a very nice lady who also complimented me on my dress. Our waitress was extremely polite, patient and resourceful (as there were some questions I had). I was slightly disappointed because we ordered crab cakes (PLURAL) and received one lol. We figured at about $10 we'd have more! I guess that's how it is at the upscale places though. The bread was delicious, as were our meals and dessert. Could have been a little more romantic!",5
"Waiters seem to be over bussy, the service is much better at the Houston location.",5
Marea delivers a high quality dining experience in a convivial setting. They also offer a wine list with a decent number of good choices.,4
"The chefs are apparently not afraid to be a bit adventurous in their ingredients. this is apparent in their addition of bone marrow to an already unconventional dish of fusilli with octopus ragu. A ""compliments of the chef"" parsnip soup was delicious and a nicety especially for a newer restaurant in these challengening economic times. A complimentary bag (To take home)of two decoratively wrapped deserts from the pastry chef was another unexpected and tasty final touch.",5
Delicious food interestingly prepared. The 4-course menu is the way to go.,5
Clearly one of the best restaurants in the city. Imaginative and delicious combinations were served on the New Year's tasting menu with just the right size for each course. The service was impeccable and unobtrusive. I especially appreciated the helpful directions of the sommelier.,4
"Great food, as always - prices are a tad excessive.",5
worthy successor to san domenico,4
"wonderful experience from all perspectives: upscale environment, excellent food, polite and attentive service.",4
"We went to Marea with my firends and had a faboulous time. Had the spaghtti pasta and risotto, it was the best dish and amezing all night. Main entrees and pastas are nice size. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Highly recommend.",5
The sea urchin and lardo was one of the finest dishes I have ever had. The Fusilli with bone marrow and octopus fully justifies the praise that the press has dished out. Very respectful wine list with many reasonably priced and well chosen options. Overall the best meal I have had in 2009.,4
"Exceptional!!!! Lovely food, very nice service a definite keeper. It is now one of my favorite restaurants. I will be back often.",3
The $38.00 lunch was divine.,4
"It's too bad that the food was very good. Our table was next to the service station and the wait staff kept on opening and closing the drawers - it was quite not good. When I made a comment to the management (after a trip to the ladies room), they brushed it off.",3
We will not good back - there are better places with the same quality of food and a management that cares about the customer.,4
The service was excellent; the food very good though not as exceptional as the review in the Times would have led me to believe; and the ambience was also excellent.,5
NOT EQUAL TO THE HYPE. BETTER SEAFOOD AND PRICES AT ESCA.,5
"Exceptional, just what we expected.",5
"Marea is a memorable (if expensive) experience. The food is perfectly done; the service is exemplary. Although a note of caution - watch out for what the waiter is pushing. Ours touted a Slovenian pinot nero as a new up and coming wine. While it was excellent, and went well with our fish and pasta dishes, it was more expensive than some other excellent wines on the list; and far more expensive than one would expect from a ""newly discovered"" winery. That little nit aside, the meal was excellent. The shared zeppole and sardines as starters were wonderful. The salt baked whole branzino was outstanding, as were the ferratini with clams and calamari and the fusilli with octopus and bone marrow. The deserts matched the rest of the meal.",3
excellent in every way ... looking forward to returning,4
A very kind restaurant in New York where you get good service but they also beware your privacy.,4
I would go there everytimes again.,5
"We were looking forward to Marea for a while. We loved the interior design, the staff was friendly and helpful.Unfortunately the portion sizes were too small. We ate in many Michelin starred restaurants over the years and although we appreciate quality vs quantity, we expect a little more for the money.The lobster ravioli was excellent!!!!more please!! the scallops were over spiced and had no seafood flavor left..the dessert was great!",5
"Great place, the food was phenomenal. We went on Christmas Eve and was perfect. The only downside was the wait staff supply station was next to our table and was quite distracting. Would definitely go again.",4
Excellent lunch. Food is delicious abeit small portions. Service is professional. Would go back to try other items on the menu.,5
superb food and ambience. we shall become regulars,5
"The very best! Marea is my new benchmark for fine dining. The appetizers and pastas are especially noteworthy. The veal agnolotti with sweetbreads and wild mushrooms could be the best single dish I've eaten in the last couple of years. My husband, a confirmed carnivore, had the 50-day-aged steak and declared it ""Probably the best steak I've ever tasted"". Did I mention that the seafood is sublime? Although we did not have any of the fish main courses, we both had appetizers with seafood. I want to go back every week! It's not just about the food either. The room is stunning - if you were ever at San Domenico, you won't believe how the space has been transformed. And the service was impeccable and lovely.",3
"We had lunch and it was terrific. Service was quite good, particularly that of the maitre d' who accommodated our switching tables twice. Expensive, but worth it.",5
An extraordinary dining experience.,5
"Amazing food, great service and reasonably priced wine list.",4
Good food.....waiters forgot to bring food that was ordered.......requested a dessert with a candle .....celebrating a birthday.....was never brought to the table .....,5
Molto Buono! Best italian seafood in NYC. Uber professional service. Lively.,4
"Top notch service, food and ambiance. If you are a foodie at heart and into seafood and Italian food, you'll want to put this on your list for a special occassion. I've never seen seafood so well incorporated into a menu. Each dish really brought forth the best elements of the fresh seafood that they are meant to highlight. They had a steak on the menu for the non seafood types, which the guy the table over ordered and he said it was the best he had had.",5
Great seafood menu--high grades for decor.,5
the best meal in the city......incredible seafood of course...thats what marea is known for...but the pasta is to die for...........the prix fixe meal is so much food too,2
"Outstanding, plus we say Beyonce and Jay-Z there!",4
a really great addition tot he NY dining scene. Brought a dead space back to life!,4
I love this restaurant. Everything sbout this restaurant is excellent. The decor is the finest. The food is wonderful and the service is always helpful. Thank you.,4
"Unfortunately, was seated late. Condescending waitstaff and unknowledgeable sommelier...",2
rated service good but if there will be ratings for sommelier I will give her all 5 stars,5
"Very good food, very good taste you will remember the flavor but very small portions you walk away hungry.",5
I would understand if we had no reservations or if we were late ........ absolutely no excuse for the poor judgement of where we were seated.  If I am paying for this type of high end restaurant I expect a better experience.  Although the food was delicious we ordered bare minimum.... even though we are big spenders.,5
Very nice food but not Italian at all.  It's basically French food using barely an Italian hint of influence.  It's sister restaurant called Vaucluse is really nice.,5
"Very good and a value in NYC for $104 for dinner. Not the best halibut or bay scallops I've ever had, but still very good. The fusilli pasta with octopus and bone marrow was memorable.",4
"Amazing dining experience!  The food was truly outstanding (the truffle pasta was one of the best things I have ever eaten, hands down).  And the service was top-notch.  All in all, fantastic food, fantastic experience.  Highly recommend!",4
"Always a wonderful experience. Amazing pasta and fish. Wine list and wine service, led by Sommelier Francesco, is outstanding.",3
Our lunch was wonderful. This is simply one of the best restaurants in New York. I have always enjoyed my many visits to this delightful place.  I wish there was a dress code though.,4
The chicken parm is an absolute  must! By far the Best I’ve ever had.,4
Not sure why it's called Quality Italian Steakhouse. Not much Italian on the menu. Good steaks but very expensive. Overall a good experience.,4
"We had a FANTASTIC meal in Del Frisco's, it was literally the best steak we ever had, i regretted not getting a bigger sized filet mignon !! Our waitress Heather was very attentative. We were in a secluded and quiet part of the restaurant which was great cause we were on our honeymoon but the other part of the restaurant was very busy, so the atmosphere mightnt have been as good for us if we were seated in the main area. Overall i'd give our experience an 11 out of 10 !!",5
"With two story windows surrounding three sides of the restaurant and amazing decour, Del Frisco's is larger than life. A notable wine list, great steaks, terrific appetizers, and wonderful desserts, you will not be dissappointed. Unlike many of of the other signature steak houses that cater to mostly male clientele in crowded and dingy surroundings, Del Frisco's has a nice balance of male and female guests. We frequently visit Del Frisco's on our trips to NYC and are never disappointed.",5
"The restaurant itself was nice. However, our waiter twice apologized for making my date and I wait. Once was fine as I appreciated the apology, but twice was almost as if it were an excuse. While taking our order, our waiter tried to pick my salad dressing which I found to be a bit rude. Additionally, my date's dinner was good; however, the steak ordered was a bit over-cooked, and all-in-all not very enjoyable. On a positive note, we did appreciate the complimentary desert.",4
"In short, the experiece was pleasant, but not one that my date and I would recommend nor make reservations for again when visiting NY.",4
"I took my wife to Del Frisco's for our 5th wedding anniversary and she absolutely loved it. Two things about my wife: 1) She's pregnant so her food choices are limited. 2) She's not a big fan of steaks. With that said i go back to my original point she absolutely loved it. The wait staff was excellent our waiter was very knowledge about the menu and wine selection. He was very friendly and just made the whole dinning experience so much better. Now to the good part, the food. The food was some of the best i have ever eaten. The steak was so tender and juicy that my wife not a fan of steaks was in love with it. She ordered salmon to see how it would be and loved that as well. My dinning experience could not have been better.",3
"Wonderful service, great food, and nice ambiance. We'll definitely go back.",4
"We were in NYC for Memorial Day weekend for my husband's birthday. We arrived a little early, were seated at the bar, and before we could finish our cocktail, our table was ready. Our server was very informative and attentive and the food was delicious! We had written in the reservation request that it was my husband's birthday, so the server brought a complementary dessert- complete with candle! It was a lovely evening.",4
"Del Frisco's is a great place for dining on a special occasion, for business purposes, or when looking for some good food anytime. The service was excellent and the food portions were large. The filet was well cooked. Would recommend to anyone looking for a nice dining atmosphere with food that is top shelf.",4
The food at Del Frisco's is always great. I particularly love the trio of filets that is not on the menu but is almost always offered as a special. The wine list is excellent as well. I have been there numerous times and overall it is a wonderful place to dine.,3
The food was very good.  They had some creative dishes/ways of presenting dishes.  Server was excellent.  Dining room a bit loud.,5
"The food and atmosphere were excellent, but the service was slow. The server was very helpful with wine choices. Would not do separate checks so just keep that in  mind if going with a group.",4
Used to LOVE this restaurant but it has become a crazy scene.  Food is still good but absolutely IMPOSSIBLE to have a conversation.  We couldn't wait to leave.,3
"The food is good but the room was really loud, too loud in fact but the biggest issue is that service was way too rushed. The food was not properly paced and so dinner was much less enjoyable than it should have been especially at $500 for 4 people, two of which didn't drink.  Slow down, give us more than an 75 mi sites for dinner and let folks enjoy.",3
"Visited Quality Italian for my mom's birthday. The entire experience was amazing, from the food to the wine to the service. They even snuck in a free birthday cannoli for my mom with a candle and all! Definitely a great spot for a birthday!",5
The food was excellent and portions were large. It was our anniversary and we were unexpectedly given champagne and the dessert we ordered was picked up by the restaurant. Five stars!,5
"A++++++++. Awesome food, exceptional service!!!  Wait staff was amazing!  Great location!",5
Great experience,5
"The food was poor , service was terrible and I will never eat there again.",1
"We rarely eat Italian food in restaurants. Quality is fabulous Italian, carefully prepared, perfect ingredients, designed for maximum taste",5
"Our first time here and I cannot say enough wonderful things about Quality Italian!!  Our waiter was incredible and we spoke to him so many times during dinner but I did not get his name, anyway he was wonderful up to and including extra dessert in our doggie bag for the next day.  The food is amazing, of course we had to have the chicken parm but it does not disappoint!!  Had leftovers the next night at home and it was just as good.  Will definitely return to try other menu items.    I'm from Philadelphia where we have great restaurants and I am a frequent visitor to NY so I know what I am talking about and I love to eat!!!  if you are reading this take my word for it and make a reservation for Quality Italian!!",5
"Very nice, overall.",4
Disappointed with the scallop crudo.  I ordered three plates for the table.,5
"We received three dishes equaling less that one scallop, in total...each plate had about 4/5 very thin pieces (mandolin sliced) of a scallop (not even 1/2 of a scallop) with what looked like a bubble/smatter of a piece of soppresatta, with oil all over the dish.  $51 for these three entrees was extremely high... tasty of course... but oil and salt is just as tasty.",3
Our main courses were great.,5
The food was delicious and the waiter was exceptional. I would highly recommend.,5
Food was ok atmosphere was horrible was very surprised to be seated next to someone with a hoodie and sneakers on? Surprised they don't have a dress code. We won't be back,4
Great food and ambiance!!!!  Highly recommend!!! One if the best restaurants in New York City.,3
Amazing. Perfection. Such a great birthday celebration,3
"Followed the viral video about the Chicken Parm ""Pizza."" It was very tasty but a bit over cooked. If they get that right the next time I will be sold on this spot! The energy is great and the service is top notch.",2
Extremely poor service. Waiter was aggressive and confrontational.,2
extremely noisy. hard to hear the person sitting across the table from you.  everything was fine.  service excellent. but wouldn't go back again if you plan on having a conversation with more then 1 person at your table,5
"I made sure to tell the host it was my boyfriends birthday and if we can have a little dessert with a candle at the end of our dinner. Of course he agreed, but did not deliver.",4
If you like outrageous noise ,4
Go for it,3
The food and waitstaff are great ,3
But but but the management and noise leave much to be desired,5
Impeccable food and service.  Quality all around.,2
"Very good food for the value, nice atmosphere in a happening part of town. Consider for everyday dinning, dates or special occasions. Chicken parm pizza is delish!",5
"What drove me crazy during the entire night is that nobody that works there knows about the normal restaurant policy of  ""The Right of Pass""",3
I understand they are very busy and they use each table 3 times every night but the guest/client has the right of pass......,2
"This restaurant opened  in a much better place back in the day and now they need to take a break and re-tune their service policy, training vision......",1
It feels they are just all too stressed or too busy to see what is in front of their noses.,4
Our first time there. Other than the chicken parmesan I thought everything else was adequate at best. The service was good. The servers were friendly. They have a descent wine list. There are so many Italian restaurants in New York that are better. We won't be back.,2
We were very disappointed with the service. Over 5 minutes before anyone came to out table. Staff very rushed. No offer to review the menu or comment on additions. We had to flag the waiter down if we needed a cocktail. The food was good.,2
It was hot sitting upstairs- when mentioned an attempt was made i hope to increase the ventilation upstairs.,5
"QI has been a birthday tradition for me for over five years, with another dozen visits in between. The food is always on point, and the hospitality conducive to groups. Unfortunately, this last visit was terrible. Our service was vacant at best, and insulting at worst. When a customer brings in seven friends, and people get treated poorly, it doesn't just reflect poorly on the business but it reflects poorly on me - being responsible for my guests having a good time. When I tried to elevate my concerns to the manager that evening by walking up front, I had the person from the front desk talk about how we may get a free dessert or two and brought some menus, but was unprepared to talk about the menu at all - really ignoring the problem of missing staff to begin with.",5
"Take this for whatever it's worth, it's possible this restaurant's best days are behind it. We won't be back, which is a shame because the ribsteak is delicious, but not the only delicious one I've had in NYC.",5
Always love coming to this restaurant. Top notch.,5
"I have eaten here probably 10 or 12 times and this was the most unfortunate  because I have had the best meals and experience here.  It was early and we needed to get in an out in an hour to see a  play. My wife and I were with my  16 year old daughter. Our waitress wasn't busy but she was never around. It was only 6 pm on  a Sunday night of Labor Day.  The backup waiter was getting us more wine , bread , etc as she was no where to be seen.",3
"When the food came out it wasn't hot and it took longer than usual. We were floored, there wasn't any one in there, but no one checked on our food  and it just sat and got cold. ",4
Finally i had to go to make the show and when she went and got the bill she went to another table with it and was talking to them for at least 5 to 10 min just holding my bill under her arm. I finally had to ask the back up waiter to go get her and please bring me the bill. ,3
Very disappointing and not the usual quality Italian experience.,4
David,5
"The food & drinks at Quality Italian are amazing! Every appetizer I had - chicken parm pizza, eggplant meatballs, guacamole- all amazing. Dinner was delicious, spicy lobster penne vodka was a great choice. The drinks were good too, the margarita was spicy and amazing. But... very expensive. Worth though if you want amazing food & drinks!",5
Service a bit sluggish but professional. Chicken Parm was not hot. Enjoyed the pasta.,5
"Sister restaurant of Quality Meats, Quality Italian.  Friend and I decided to go for italian on a saturday night and was able to get a reservation for 8 with 2 hour notice no problem.  ",5
"Got the porterhouse agnolotti, spicy lobster rigatoni alla vodka, and split a dry aged rib steak with brussel sprouts.  OVerall, dining experience was pretty good, but that is only because the steak was phenomenal.  The pastas were good, but nothing overwhleming.  3.5 stars at best.  Will repeat to perhaps try out the Chicken parm pizza others rave about.",4
"Wonderful meal, reasonably quiet, waiter John was very attentive",5
"We felt lucky to get a reservation at primetime on the Friday before Labor Day. Our table could not have been more perfect for family conversation. The staff was friendly, attentive and really nice. I'm a vegetarian who was dining with 4 carnivores, but I couldn't have been happier with my selections. I was able to get the chopped Italian salad without the standard pepperoni chips and the gnocchi with leeks as my main course. Both were delicious. We all thought we were full but could not resist dessert. ",5
I have heard that the place can be noisy but we did not experience this.,5
Amazing Italian! Spices were out of this world with the freshest tomatoes. Everything from the wine to the appetizers to the pasta were fantastic. Definitely recommend!,5
Excellent service. Our waiter George was outstanding. Him and his partner waiter were extremely knowledgeable and made our dining experience a very pleasurable one.,5
"Celebrating our anniversary. Had a 5:30 res before seeing a show. Arrived on time and seated immediately. Service was polite and attentive, yet not rushed. Started the meal with comp'd sparkling as a really nice gesture. Meal was excellent. Bolognese sauce had a rich flavor and steak was perfectly cooked. Finished with a cannoli that was the perfect exclamation point on a wonderful experience. Space is ""chic industrial"". Not opulent but certainly worthy of a special night out. Would definitely return!",4
"We have been several times before and never disappointed.  The food is excellent - chicken parm pizza a crowd favorite and great way to start; pasta and steak all delicious and perfectly prepared; great sides. And excellent cocktails and a really solid wine list, including a lot of moderately prices options, including some excellent off the run Italian wines.",4
Quaint and romantic date spot-dress up trendy vibe with central nyc location;),5
I've eaten at the sister restaurant Quality Meats in Miami but Quality Italian is by far much better.  First the service was outstanding.  Our waiter was attentive and recommended several dishes and drinks that were delicious.  The Midtown was an absolutely terrific drink.  We started with the Caesar salad and had the branzino and lamb chops.  all were fantastic.  definitely will be back,5
Drinks were on point. The seafood platter was a little weak for the price. Octopus a little overdone. The pasta was phenomenal. Tomahawk steak was ordered as medium-rare it came as well done but tasted delicious. Porterhouse and chicken parm were excellent! A must try for all that visit. I love the honey and dried olives. The arugula was perfect as was the Caesar salad ( one of the best I have ever eaten),5
The snores dessert was heaven. ,5
Party of 9. Everyone was happy.,4
It was for my birthday and not only was the food great they went above and beyond to make sure it was a great experience,3
Great service and terrific food. Enjoyed the chicken parm appetizer!,4
Great food creative menu but pricey. The pricing format makes it very expensive with everything separate. But food is outstanding to the taste. The open dining hall is vey loud with the tables close together. Heard more of our neighbors conversation then our own. Staff was very knowledgeable and friendly.,5
It was wonderful celebration of our anniversary. The wait staff was aware and very nice to us!,5
Just a phenomenal place...from the bartender Liam to the wonderful wait staff ......I come back often,4
"My husband, child and I drove up from Delaware to have dinner with my in-laws who drove down from Connecticut and meet us here at Quality Italian for dinner. Although they didn't have a kids' menu, they were able to make something simple for my child to eat. The atmosphere is extremely cozy, the restaurant and bathrooms are super clean, and the food is just amazing. We've all been to Quality Meats two or three times and this was our first time at Quality Italian. We will definitely be returning!!",5
Excellent food but very pricey,5
Awesome steak. Best filet in years. Tomato and burata salad sooo good. Wish we had room for dessert . Waiter perfect. Ha knew we were pre theater but we were early and he slowed down the meal for us .,4
The restaurant is a beautiful space and the service was good but the food didn't measure up. Maybe time to invest some of the decor money in an executive chef.  Also some of the lunch entrees seemed way too big for a human. A way to justify the prices I suppose. It wasn't my first time there but probably my last too many other choices.,5
Excelentes carnes y pastas.,5
"Best meal I've had in my 4 years living in New York. Lobster rigatoni alla vodka, Caesar salad, and Quality Parm were amazing",5
Everything was delicious and they had their own spin on certain everyday items like the Caesar salad with pickled lemon rind (?) on it.,5
"The food & service at Quality Italian are every bit as wonderful as ever, but boy has it gotten loud in there! It used to be a nice place for a date, but my husband and I could barely hear each other, even after we moved away from the large group we were initially seated next to.  And that was on a Monday night.",5
"We were visiting New York City from Boston and we ended up at quality Italian because it was close to our hotel and we love their steakhouse quality meats. I'm so glad we went!! Our server Julie Rose was so friendly and warm, she really made our night. The food was amazing as well, we had the tomato/stratcitella  , shrimp scampi, spinach and polenta as well as the lamb cavatelli special-all phenomenal!! Can't wait til we can return!",5
We came for brunch - husband and I and the service and food were excellent overall.,5
I ordered the chicken parm brunch pizza which came with eggs sunny side on top.  It comes with bacon but you can opt out of that.  The waiter was kind to inform us of anything that had pork in it as my husband does note at pork.  ,5
We had the monkey bread to start which is savory with chestnut honey butter ,5
the baked egg white frittata and the yogurt granola.,5
"They sat us in a round table for 4. The waiter took more than 15 minutes to get to our table and ask us if we wanted water. I had to call attention several times to be served bread and this type of service continued throughout the dinning. The bus boys where on top of everything, better than our waitress. Overall food was good, but service was bad for a restaurant with hype.",2
"Very impressive selection of seafood dishes in the Italian style. If you are a serious seafood lover, check out this great place!",4
"Situated on Central Park S, this is a fabulous location. The idea of Italian seafood is refreshing given the plethora of Italian eateries trying to appeal to the same dining wallets. The crudi selections were all good with even the more plebian species prepared simply and tasting wonderful because of the freshnesss and presentation. Service is responsive and thoughtful when you raised questions about menu items.",4
"My only complaint is that the wine list was a bit disappointing. There are all kinds of wonderfully fresh whites from Campania, friuli and even Piedmonte. The wine-by-the-glass offering was slim picking. Given the different textures of the seafood, you would like to have a range of whites to accompany the change of courses.",4
Only good things to say. Wonderful time.,5
"Superb dining experience. Great wine list, of which our server was quite knowledagable. Service was very attentive, but not overbearing. Prix fixe menu was a great value for the two of us, & the selections (kumamoto oysters, lobster ravioli, John Dory, scallops, & dessert were all excellent. Next time we are in NYC, we will definitely return. I would not, however, put this in the ""neighborhood gem"" category in opentable.com web site - the restaurant seems too large, & too much near the center of things (Broadway, Lincoln Center, etc) to be a neighborhood gem.",5
"I was extremely impressed with this restaurant. The food was excellent (and I'm a serious foodie). Everything was done wonderfully, and the pasta was fresh and homemade. The ""business lunch"" special is also a good deal, considering the quality of the food. Great wine list. Service was great overall, although the one thing that the restaurant could do better is to listen when I ask for a recommendation instead of recommending only the most expensive things on the menu (like the crudo tasting for an extra $8 when I asked which crudo he recommended). Otherwise, fabulous.",5
"We visited this restaurant after reading a favorable New York Times review and it did not disappoint. The decor is sleek but not cold and the place is quiet even though it is located on a busy street with lots of traffic. The service was very attentive without being pretentious. The food was to die for! I recommend the prix fixe menu and particularly the scallops and the dessert which resembles an ice cream sandwich, only better.",5
"Second time we've been. The food was on point-always a tough challenge for seafood. The only issue we had was when we were leaving, and the restaurant was getting quiet, we asked if the kitchen would be able to accommodate a special request for desert. Instead of being pleasant, or saying ""Let me check and see,"" the waiter (and ultimately the manager) immediately became arrogant and dismissive of the request. It was almost as if we had tried to go in the kitchen and cook something ourselves! Bad ending to an otherwise good meal because of simple lack of pleasantries.",4
"They are highly rated by Zagat, they know it, and they realize there is a line of diners to take your place when you leave.",4
Everyone in the party rated the food very good. Main service issue was seating delay of 40 minutes which Marea tried to compensate for with a round of bubbly.,4
"definitely an older demographic (understandable given its location), but recent critical success gives it the kind of full-to-bursting feel that was more normal 2 yrs ago, but without the attitude of that time. great place all around.",2
"The Restaurant was a pleasant experience- However, the waiter was not that attentive to our table and had a rude aura about him. The price was very high for the fish by the pound and the restaurant was definitely overrated.",4
"Completely over-priced and nothing special. It's a lovely restaurant with very good service, but the food was far from anything special. There are other restaurants in the neighborhood (literally steps away from Marea) with Michelin rating where the food and the accompanying price are worth it. Marea, in my opinion, is not. Very expensive for what it is.",5
"Would be fun with a large group. It’s a high energy place. Steak is pretty good, but not a pure steak destination. All around, a solid restaurant. Amazingly good value for where it is.",4
It was our third visit and our joy is still great. Good luck,4
"This was an outstanding dining experience! The food was exciting, and we really wanted to cancel our next reservations and return to Marea. Our best dining this trip. The bar area was most attractive as well. Our waiter was very helpful with our menu selections, and we can't wait to go back.",5
Maitre'D was super friendly which immediately set the tone for the lunch which was delicious. Food portions were good size to enjoy 3-courses. Our waiter was a little tardy but not so much so to ruin the experience for us. Definitely go back again.,4
"Just went to Marea for lunch with friends and loved the restaurant. The food was just right. Preparation was excellent, ingredients were fresh, the presentation was very nice. Service was not intrusive. The bar area was covered in translucent Onyx and was spectacular. The price was suprisingly reasonable.",5
I had an excellent lunch here. Two excellent pasta dishes are fusilli with octopus and a bone marrow tomato sauce and a spaghetti with sea urchin and crab. The crudo was fresh and accompanied by interesting condiments. The appetizer of lobster and burrata was too salty and I didnt really enjoy the combination of textures.,1
"This Italian, primarily seafood restaurant, was expensive but well worth it. Crudo, which we did not have, was emphasized. (If I want sushi I will have sushi.) The fusilli with octopus and bone marrow (tomato based sauce) was wonderful. Altogether, a fine dining experience. We shall return.",4
"A pretentious over-priced, cold and bland restaurant. Attitude like Henry Ford, when he said that you could get his car in any color you like as long as it is black. The owner and the staff need to be taken out back and then lock the door.",5
Fantastic steak house. Dine here every time we visit NYC. Always satisfied. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Highly recommend.,5
"Business lunch-Lunch with incredible fresh rolls, NE Clam Chowder, Filet Sandwich was excellent. (Only minor item, can we have ice tea in traditional tall glasses with plenty of ice, not short glasses?) Would go back again---a memorable lunch.",5
Fantastic!!,5
Had to wait over than 15 mins to have a seat although i made a reservation in advance. The serving manner was not really good she hit me when she comes with food or drinks to serve the tables near me every time and never say sorry!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! But the food was perfect so it deserves this rate.,3
"Fantastic food. Good service. Polite staff. Seating is a bit close together, and restaurant is noisy due to the close proximity of your neighbor as well as the bar. Large portions of food. Everything is a la carte so be sure to share side dishes. Filet is wonderful! Enjoy!",5
"I am a HUGE fan of Quality Meats and go there often and have for almost five years.  Everything I usually have is outstanding and the service is top notch.  This trip the aged rib eye steak I had was AMAZING, but the Sirloin steak my husband has was a little tough - which is so rare for QM.  I can't stress enough to go and try QM.",4
Quality steaks at Quality Meats - would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to eat the best steak in NYC,5
"Filet was great and was prepared to order. Sides were also very good, especially the corn cream brulee!",4
Never disappoints!!,5
"Food and service was off the charts!!!  And, they make a darn fine espresso martini.",5
"Nice healthy portions of meat, and the potato chips were delicious!   I will definitely come back here again next time I am in New York.",5
Exceptional!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
"The food took more than 1 hour since we order it  to get to the table, the meet was kind of dry (very different from my last time there) I receive complementary dessert but does nos pay for the delay and quality of food at all.",3
A bit disappointed... service was slow and food was nothing special...so noisy and lots of guests were shouting in the restaurant... food portion was very big,3
"One of the best steaks you will ever eat.  Generous side items with unique twists, such as Parmesan waffle fries, and broccoli cheese bites.",5
But the steak is the star of the meal.,5
Great service by Kerry and Ricardo.  Best steak we've ever had even though mine was more rare than medium-rare.  Servers paid for one of my drinks because of that.  Would highly recommend if you are willing to spend some money and want an unbelievable steak.,5
The food was excellent and the service was great. A little over priced but I was willing to go,4
The extra mile. Much better than the one in south beach.,4
Special friend catch up,5
Steak was a bit tough.,5
Service is fantastic and the food is exceptional.,4
One of the best bone in rib eyes in NYC.  The service and food were great.  Cant' wait to return.,1
Make sure you order the bacon appetizer with peanut butter and jalapeno.,4
Great food but not into their bench seating ... very noisy .... great food ..,5
"Had a reservation for 8, didn't get seated until 8:45 and the hostess at the front was not professional about the delay. For a business meal, making the table available on time is of utmost importance. Not having the table ruined the mood for a lot of the participants. Will not be coming back, plenty of other steakhouses in NY that treat customers better for the amount of money we spend.",5
Wonderful steaks with attentive service and an excellent wine list.,5
It was good except stake.,5
I was looking forward to eating stake. But I was disappointed.,4
"Pricey, like all the big steak houses.  But the food is fabulous, attentive wait staff, convenient location, and a festive vibe.",1
I can always count on a satisfying experience at Quality Meats. Thank you.,2
"Quality meats is a good place to take clients and eat at the bar if you're dining solo. Steaks are great. Potato dishes are ok. Corn brûlée and gnocchi side dishes are great. Best rolls anywhere. Service super and our waiter comped a couple of extra side dishes, thus my recommended items.",5
As usual very good to outstanding in all respects. Presentations are really good as is food and service. At times noise level is a bit over bearing but other than that it is consistently very good to outstanding.,5
Terrible service from the hostess. The waiters were kind of nice. The meat was cold,5
Food was cold. Waiter never came back to check on us. After everything I heard about this place we were disappointed.,5
What a great experience! We were visiting NY and were told by a friend we had to eat here. And now i know why. ,5
"Such a beautiful  restaurant, with the most  efficient,  knowledgable and friendly  staff you could ask for. The  Quality of our meals was unbeatable. It was a little pricey but worth it for the  overall experience.",5
Food was AMAZING. The server was very friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend for a romantic dinner.,3
Nothing much to say best steakhouse in New York City    Thank you for ending my trip so well   ,5
We throughly enjoyed our dining experience. Food was delicious and the surroundings very comfortable with a warm yet modern vibe. We will return.,4
"Fabulous cuisine in a upbeat atmosphere, will definitely return again.",5
"Our waiter had a bit of an attitude, but otherwise service was great",5
Wonderful food and decore. We were seated promptly and courteously even though we arrived early. A mixup in the kitchen resulted in our appetizers arriving after the first course. Staff was slow to refill our wine glasses. Wine steward was knowledgeable and friendly. He graciously picked up on my hint at recommending a more reasonably priced wine.,5
We'll be back to try their homemade pasta. Dinner for three with a $95 wine was $440.,3
Impeccable--among the very best.,5
Amazing food and service! Highly recommend.,3
Our waiter was superb. He made the evening special. I loved all my dishes except my fish dish. The wine was also excellent and I would definitely like to return as there were other items on the menu that must be tried. The prix fixe is a reasonable considering the overall menu pricing and at 4 courses is more manageable than a tasting menu is for your stomach.,3
"The front of the restaurant was nice, but my party was stuffed in the ghetto section, which was also the bus boy station. We realized the tables around us turned over quickly, and I believe the reservations specialist confused my party with a pre-theater reservation. The service at the table was attentive, but plates and utensils were crashing constantly at the bus-boy station. The service by the host at the end of the meal was poor. He and the hostess were gracious enough to have taken our coats when we had arrived, but when we were done and went up to retrieve our belongings, the host was standing at his podium, intentionally ignoring and avoiding us, until the hostess arrived to accept out ticket. Have mixed feelings, no plans to return.",4
A fabulous dining experience and a wonderful birthday celebration. We will return.,5
"Food is very good, but small portions and very expensive - not a restaurant for big eaters unless you are willing to empty your bank account.",4
Thes setting is lovely and the food is unusual and adventuresome. The service staff needs better training.,1
The sea urchin spaghetti and gianduja dessert are two standouts - but a terrific (if expensive) Italian restaurant in a city full of great Italian restaurants.,5
"Superb! Great food, great service, will come again.",4
this is a first rate restaurant. Prices have gone up since opening. That's a disappointment. But the food is outstanding. The restaurant is beautiful. It has panache.,2
I went for my birthday and it was very suitable for celebration. No extra goodie from kitchen though. At slightly less cost it would be a steady place for us to go.,3
"What happened to this rising star? Only a few months ago I referred to Marea as my favorite NYC Italian restaurant. I recommended it to anyone who cared to listen and I often received sincere thanks from those who went to Marea and enjoyed the experience. Recently, however, the feedback from those I referred to Marea started to change. For example, a business associate took a client there and came back telling me that it was difficult to assess which was worse, the food or the service. Having been out of NYC for several months, I found this review--and similar--difficult to believe but I was unable to judge for myself. Last week, I returned to NYC and Marea for one of the worst restaurant experiences of my life. Service and food = D-",4
perfect. especially the truffle pasta,2
"at lunch very small portions, but very tasty",3
"we arrived a bit early and let them know we would be at the bar waiting for our friends. the desk knew that our party was already there and asked if we would like to be seated right away. we declined for a drink at the bar first and then we would sit. they came and got us at the bar at our reservation time and we had a great table. we all love food and wine so dinner was a big mix of different items. clams casino though tasty were VERY small little necks. sliders not up to par this time a bit bland. entrees were very good; 36 oz rib eye, short ribs, 24 oz rib eye. we had 6 sides all very very yummy. 2 bottles of red (2007 jordan)and two broubons. desserts not so good. dinner for 5 with tip was $800.",4
"Our meal was great, but the wine list should have more options for under $100/ bottle.",4
"Steak was average - nothing outstanding, place was too noisy to have a pleasant conversation, quantity counts more than quality",3
The restaurant was very similar to your location in LA the booths are the same but the location is different and the front lounge area is very interesting and I want to return and experience sitting there.,5
food was outstanding and a great happening spot in Midtown. We loved the whole experience.,5
We had a great meal and got out in enough time to make our show.,5
i wasn't aware this isn't a restaurant for dining but an impressively set hookup scenery which happens to offer food besides the earsplitting and conversation killing top-hit-radio dj.,1
it's all about the meat..,4
The food is served hot and in some interesting ways. Food is very good and the service is quick and professional.,4
The restaurant was very noise at the beginning ( 7:15pm ) and by 8:30 I was able to hear,4
my friend without shouting. The table are very close to each other. The person on my left keep bumping into my arm.,5
The steak delious and tasty. The corn pudding excellent. Dessert was okay - but great presentation. The wait service were attentive. This is my 3rd time back,2
"The food, service and ambiance were very good. However, the music was too loud. There's a live DJ onsite and I love music playing in the background. However, this was loud like a club and I couldnt even have a normal convo unless I was yelling across the table. If you're looking for a quiet dinner, this is not the place.",5
Great service and the food was amazing! STK doesn't disappoint.,3
"This past weekend, we had a 7:15 reservation for a party of 6. Four of us arrived at 7:20 and the maitre d' asked us how far behind the other 2 were as we were already ""running late"". We told him that we would be happy to sit and start ordering drinks, but he said they couldn't do that. Our friends showed up about 5 or so minutes later and when they seated us, only about 50% of the tables were full.",4
That comment from the maitre d really rubbed me the wrong way as I immediately began to stress about when the other people in my party would arrive and what would happen to our table if they were running even later. That's not the reason I go out with my friends on a Saturday night.,4
I had reservations and called to say I was going to be late 1 1/2 hour and they said no problem..y wife and I got we ordrered drinks at the bar which had a very cool atmosphere great music and the place is very sheek.service was fast friendly and our waitress was very helpful.(He steak was exellent and the dover sole was to die for.All in all an exellent expience,4
"Food is good and ambience is fun... I don't mind paying if the food and everything is phenomenal this is not the case here. food is over priced, drinks are overpriced, and tables are way to close together to have a private conversion and of your at a table for two, your a mile from eacother",5
Food was very good and the atmosphere was fun and lively. The music mix was festive but a little too loud and the wine list was extensive but over the top expensive.,4
"Always fun to have the energy buzz. Love the food, the ambiance and for sure the music. Some time, just a bit loud. Would need to be adjusted to a bit quieter when not too many people around. It would add a cozier feel when the restaurant is not full.",5
"I went for lunch with a coworker and the place had a nice upbeat vibe and the food was good. My coworker raved about the burger. I had the fish wish was good. Our waitress was pleasant, courteous and attentive. Overall a good experience",2
Had an absolutely wonderful experience. The decor is beautiful. The music is crazy awesome- the dj played the best songs the whole time!! It was loud but so fun!! Our waittress Cora was excellent and all the service workers were friendly efficient and attentive. Always wonderful to see people work as a team and help one another which only makes your experience better. Dinner moved right along and we enjoyed every single course!,4
"The food was excellent and the service was friendly and quick. I would definitely recommend this restaurant, although it is a little loud - we loved it because the DJ was great, but you should be prepared for that.",5
Excellent meal. Our service and food was outstanding.,4
"The blonde hostess/receptionist was not nice to my son and told him that we have to leave the restaurant at 7:30 PM. She did not even offer him and his companion seats upon arrival while waiting for us, his parents who were still parking our car. And we haven't ordered yet.",3
This is the first time we encountered a rude and uneducated hostess in a fine dining restaurant. She should be fired or assigned in the kitchen and not be allowed to entertain customers.,2
We always eat in a fine dining restaurant and we do not eat for free. We pay and give big tips. This is the first time we experienced it.,5
"However, Lily, the server, made our wedding anniversary celebration memorable. She gave us great service by being pleasant to us. The des",5
"On the ground floor of the Grace building, just touching distance from Times Square is this swanky place. A very modern and stylish steakhouse that does exactly what you'd expect. Low lights, good ambience and a stlish clientelle. The food was excellent and no more than other high end steak houses but the place had a great vibe to it provided by a DJ. Worth a visit if you like great food and stlyish lounge bars. If you like the more classical eel then stay away.",5
Service is among the best and the food surprised me on how sophisticated they made their hamburger with fries. The meat is superior. Definately will go back.,2
The place was really nice. The food was great. I like the other location better. And we had to wait 30 minutes to be seated when we had reservations and it was a Tuesday night.,4
"Very lively with quite a bit of noise, including piped in music",4
"The food was merely adequate and nothing special...other steakhouses are better and not as expensive. It was by no means worth what we paid....dinner for four was $600, which this was definitely not worth. We would not return nor would we recommend to any of our friends.",5
The steak melts in your mouth. I recommend the corn pudding as a side dish.,5
Great food and atmosphere. Quite expensive but worth it if you're in the mood for an excellent meal and terrific service.,2
The food at STK blew me away. Everything we got was savory and flavorful. Our waiter made great recommendations on the toppings and sauces and was very friendly. It was a great atmosphere for a romantic dinner - exactly what we were looking for. We will definitely be back.,2
The service and price simply do not meet expectations.,2
Excellent food. The staff were very accommodating when our party arrived late but we felt a bit rushed afterwards.,3
The check came at the same time as the dessert and without our asking.,2
Apart from that the food was very good and the drinks as well.,5
"Restaurant had a great atmosphere. Service was good. However, server continued to try & upsale wine and more expensive menu items without answering genuine questions about the entrees, etc from members in our party. Frustrating.",3
"Quality is a factory, may be good for partying groups, but......... Food was very good, but nothing that isn't done equally as well in so many other places. Loud, NOISY room on a Saturday night. 3 hours for our meal, servings were paced with long intervals of waiting. Our ""waiter"" disappeared for long periods of time, apologizing at the end out our service (tip rescue effort?). I suppose a good spot in mid-town for event groups, but would not recommend for couples or 4's. Footnote: wine markups 3 - 4 X retail (at least double reasonably acceptable for restaurant). Damages: $475 w/tip out the door for 3 people, be prepared.",2
"This was my second time at Quality Italian...it was such a great experience the first time that my husband and I had to go back with friends! Must try list: chicken parm (which looks like a pizza, but it's actually breaded chicken with melted cheese on top); clams; octopus salad appetizer; veal milanese On top of the food being delicious, the service is truly excellent - very attentive staff. This is definitely not a quiet place - there's some music playing in the background, but it hardly drowns out the din of people chatting. All in all a great restaurant that I highly recommend!",5
"I normally eat here with clients during the week for lunch but was finally able to let loose and stay awhile on a recent rainy Saturday. Kendra made great cocktails at the street-level ""welcome bar"" and Roger, the GM, warmly greeted us off the elevator after hoisting up leftover drinks. Abdi finished off the experience with super service at the bar on the way out.",4
"Great space, great steak, great wine, and a great time!",5
Great restaurant to go to with your parents,2
The noise level is overwhelming which of course forces everyone to speak louder without realizing it. I had to ask the people at the next table to lower their voices - twice - because they could not hear me the first time. Food was good but not great. Decor is industrial grunge meets tuscany - very weird,4
Took clients to lunch and we had a great meal. There was something for everyone on the menu and the food was really good! Our service was excellent and our servers were attentive but not overbearing. Overall it was a great experience!,4
We went for my wife's birthday. We are big fans of quality meats so we decided to check out quality Italian finally. We enjoyed it and will certainly be back.,5
Lovely experience. Food was prepared and presented with precision and grace. We loved the total experience.,1
"Three of us went to Sunday lunch. The service was horrible, the selection was disappointing. When serving a dish that did not look like what one of us had ordered, the server said ""I do not cook the food, I only bring it out"". When our server poured our wine, the pour was very small. One of us commented and his response was ""these are big glasses"". Needless to say, I will not return.",5
My second visit was even better than the first. We enjoyed the entire experience. The waiter was fantastic. I would visit this place every time Im in NYC.,4
It is a beautiful restaurant with two floors with amazing food. Make sure you make reservations and the night will be unforgettable.,5
Highly recommend the chicken parmesan!,4
"Have had many great client lunches and Friday's was better than the last! Food, service, interiors are all above par. Coming back soon!!",5
"The food, ambiance, and service were great!!",4
"Great Italian meets steakhouse cuisine. The two blend in seamlessly together with dishes such as the porterhouse steak agnolotti. Amazing corn creme brulee. Overall, an outstanding dining experience.",5
"Not only is the food and service excellent, but the layout of the restaurant is very cool!",5
"I could have ordered anything on the menu, every dish looked better then the next. What we did order was all amazing and I have to go back with a bigger party so I can try a bunch of different plates. The chicken parm pizza was insane and worth every penny. Also the zeppoles for dessert were worth over stuffing my face. I definitely left full but completely satisfied and I can't wait to go back!",3
"Came here for dinner on a Sunday night. Heard about the pizza shaped chicken parm, and it lived up to the hype. However, the service from our waiter was horrendous. She was good in the beginning when she took our order, but once she took the order, she did not come back until it was time to order dessert. We didn't notice that we had not gotten the complimentary garlic bread until the table next to us got it from a different waiter.",2
The chicken parm was huge and delicious - we couldn't finish the whole thing. We also ordered 2 sides (spinach and pasta) and the Fererro Rocher gelato.,5
I would recommend the place for the food and hopefully the service would be better!!,5
The chicken parmigiana that they are famous for seemed like a giant processed chicken nugget. Chopped salad was boring and oily. Not worth the money or time,5
Few things you need to know about Quality Italian:,5
-TOMAHAWK STEAK AND CHICKEN PARM PIZZA is out of this world,5
- MAKE SURE YOU GET THE SAUSAGE AND PEPPER APPETIZER,4
- impeccable service,5
- great menu,3
- great wine list,5
- great cocktails,1
- HUGE restaurant in the middle of NYC. Perfectly situated in midtown to go to before a show,3
- Must reserve a week or two in advance,4
- my mouth is watering as I type this,5
"we had a great meal, everything we ordered was delicious.",5
"in reality, chicken parm definitely LOOKS cooler than it is, however it was delicious, and i would recommend getting it, not only for the experience - it's fun! - but it was delicious, and ranks high compared to others I have had. maybe just could have used a little more sauce?",5
"the steak w/ bone marrow was a standout!!! the artichoke mac and cheese lacked artichoke, but was still great mac & cheese. lamb pasta special was awesome, albeit small, considering server's embellishing description.",3
"canoli cart was fun, but more of a gimmick. there are better dessert options - see gelato menu.",4
"overall a great meal, and i would go back, and order some of same and some new items.",4
We went there for my friend's birthday and we absolutely loved the food and the service. Our favorite dish was the chicken parmigiana and the crème brulee corn. I would definitively recommend this place for a special occasion.,5
Food and service best in NYC! Had a great meal and amazing service!,3
I order a fillet medium but it came out well done. They offered is free dessert which was nice but trhe desserts were below average,4
Food was great but way overpriced!,3
"The restaurant has a very nice ambiance. The food was absolutely delicious! The only complaint is that it took awhile for the staff to attend to us initially; however, once they did, the service was exceptional.",4
Scene was very high energy- like Las Vegas. Drinks and bar were great. Food was disappointing. Appetizer portions were very small and the steak was not tender at all. Quality Meats is a better choice for food.,2
"Friday night dinner. I was excited to dine at STK midtown for the first time as I have enjoyed their other NYC location several times. Upon entering, the restaurant scene immediately struk me as vistually pleasing. The ambiance is outstanding. I enjoy the ""trendy steakhouse"" vibe. Service was great. Music was loud enough to give you the right feel, but not so loud you couldn't have a conversation at a normal speaking volume. One thing that was only a little disappointing was the food. I started with the shrimp cocktail. I'm used to ""monster size"" steakhouse shrimp. These were kind of medium size. No biggie though. But the steak - I got the filet, medium rare. It was ok but kind of bland, I wish it had more flavor or spices.",4
Everything was great about this Resturant :-),5
"The service was fabulous! Our waiter continuously checked on us, recommended wine, apps and entrees. The parmesean truffle fries were TODIEFOR as were the mushroom and asparagus apps. I had the small filet as my entre and the meat was preferctly cooked and I ate every morsel on my plate. Overall great experience!",5
"Great experience however the atmosphere died down quite early in the evening,",4
- excellent cocktail menu,4
- great food,3
- hostess was welcoming and professional. My request for a nice table was granted.,5
"- overall, a great experience",4
"An amazing room, perfunctory service and startling prices make for an interesting meal. The prix-fix lunch is a great bargain however, and shouldnt be missed. and although stratospheric at $38, the lobster cobb is delish and my expense-account favorite lunch; tiny deviled quail eggs alone make the plate amusingly bright.",1
"Delicious again. Both steaks were cooked to perfection this time. My steak was incredible and super rare, as I prefer :)",3
"Love the large, open room. The tables were not too close, so we could HEAR each other! Service was good, food was good.",5
I had a way overshadowed skirt steak which was not tasty.,5
"Nothing out of the ordinary, the food was ok, I had the chicken sandwich and my friend had the prix fix with the hamburger and we could have eaten in any other burger joint and it would not have been any different. The space is beautiful and the service is good, so if you want to go to a cool place and don't care about the food, this is a place to go.",5
Wasn't as noisy at your downtown location.  Very cozy would come again. Waitress was very friendly and helpful with suggestions.,5
"Really enjoyed stk midtown. I was a bit skeptical at first because I am used to stk in the meat-packing district, but I loved it! The food was great, maybe even better than meat-packing, and the waitress was great. I will be back !",3
Wonderful restaurant for steak lovers. Great bar scene and awesome music! Pricey!,5
"Excellent food and service; gorgeous venue. Great, though sometimes excessively loud, music.",3
Very pricey for average food. Ambiance and service was great.,4
The food and service were excellent!!,2
"The staff is excellent, except unfortunately we had a new server and she would leave us unattended for long periods of time while she chatted with her friends, when she did come to the table to respond to one of our friends requests, she would take the request and dart off without even glancing at anyone else at the table to take their orders. It was a tedious evening because of this server.",5
"The food was okay, nothing outstanding for the price. Service was excellent and the interior desin was interesting. The music was loud, like you were at a dance club.",3
"I don't know what has made this restaurant group so popular, but it can't be the menu or the food preparation.  Don't bother, go to Keen's instead.",5
"Great staff, great food, and great atmosphere.",4
"STK is essentially a restaurant that resembles a nightclub. The midtown location has a dj playing very loud music making it clear this place is catering to the birthdays and bachelorette party crowd. If your scene is short skirts and stilettos, STK is for you. I was enjoying the music, even if it was a little too loud, and the food was very good. I had the 10oz filet cooked as I had asked. My partner had the duck and he loved it. We both loved the mushrooms side dish. It was tasty enough to be a meal on it's own. The only miss was the bread...dry. Service was efficient and there were good wines on the list too.",5
Very good service. Make sure you dont have tight pockets. But worth every penny.,5
"Overall, the experience was very good. The food was outstanding. The service was good but left something to be desired. I was not happy with the table and seating selection and expressed that to the hostess prior to being seated. I willingly offered to be patient and continue to order drinks (and spend money) at the bar, as we waited for a booth to become vacant and available for the seating that I preferred. My request was declined, and I was left with a ""take it or leave it"" type of gesture. My date did not think it was a big deal, however, I considered jus walking out of the restaurant and going to have dinner somewhere that values the requests of its customers. Needless to say, I did not tip my hostess as originally planned.",4
"Everything was fabulous. We had amazing service and even got a free dessert sampler! They brought my friend the smaller size filet (she ordered the medium) and they immediately and professionally rectified the mistake and then we got free dessert!We got steaks - I like mine VERY rare - I think mine could have been much more rare, but I was hungry and it was very juicy and well seasoned.We got the creamed spinach (amazing) and the special lobster Mac n cheese (this was one of the most delicious sides I've ever tasted however - no one told us it was $36!!! - though it did have 3 big lobster chunks on top but still - it was a side portion and no one told us!All in all - really great - already have another res lined up!",5
"Food is delicious, presented beautifully by the chefs. Great service! Very friendly staff. I will be recommending STK to others as they look for a place to eerience while visiting NYC,",4
We had a very uncomfortable booth but the food and service were outstanding.,3
"With an awesome first trip under my belt, I came here on my day off and decided to go all out.  Now with time on my hands, I had their best Malbec, and was very satisfied!",5
The service I found this visit was better than the first time I went; and I was very pleased with the service the first time around!,4
"Outside of Restaurant Week, this establishment may indeed see more of me!!",4
"We just had appetizers and wine but everything was very delicious and the service was great. Our only criticism was that the cost was exuberant, $17 for a glass of wine - really?",5
Very expensive for two overall considering did not purchase a bottle of wine.,5
"Salads and sides were small, especially for the price",4
"I've been to the STK in Beverly Hills as well and find that STK Midtown has a much better vibe if you're into the nightlife/hip scene. It was a young/professional crowd and the music was on point. Location is unbeatable although parking can be difficult if you're not familiar with the area - but remember, you're in NYC. Food was fantanstic as usual but be prepared to spend some $$$. Service was good, nothing to rant or rave about but served the purpose.",2
We had a wonderful dinner experience and the staff was there for need we could have had.,5
"The waitresses we had were wonderful. They were attentive, their timing was great, and had perfect blend of professionalism ond friendliness. They tag-teamed midway through our meal and I appreciate their efficiency. The food was good but can't say it's worth what they charge. It definitely was not as good as the first time I ate there.",3
"Brilliant restaurant - have been a few times now and will definitely be back next time we're in New York. The steak sauce is brilliant, but not a bad thing to say about anything.",5
"love this place, totally reliable quality, but the staff make it.",4
"Perfect Service, Quality, and Ambiance wrapped into one.",4
"A bit noisy but definitely outstanding for food quality, dining experience and location. Atmosphere surprisingly conducive both to [close] conversations on a date or impressing a business client!",4
"Too full to try dessert this night but food quality, portions and attention to details were all excellent.",5
"Our first visit to Quality Meats was a first-class dining experience for us. Not only was the food excellent, the service was outstanding (Jim F. being our server): perfect timing, attentive, and, above all, warm and friendly. We plan to return soon.",5
Great place for a business dinner. The corn creme brulee is unbelievable,4
"My friends and I went for their restaurant week lunch menu. I had scallops for an appetizer - which was divine! Then, the hanger steak for entree. This had an interesting mix of flavors. My only complaint was was the dessert - it was good, but ice cream in winter? really?",4
"Overall, I was very happy with my choice of restaurant.",5
"Dining experience was great! It was my first time to the restaurant; Restaurant Week brought me in. Had lunch, which was a great deal... I glanced at the 'normal' prices and seems very expensive. I would probably come back for special occasions. The soup, steak and ice cream were excellent! Overall experience was good- felt like a meat locker- was a cool, unique setting.",3
"Just fantastic! Great decor, interesting and delicious food, enjoyable overall.",5
"First time experienced on a Saturday. Food was very good, but seating was to close for comfort; energetic environment, but felt to rushed when ordering and eating. Also to noisy. Better for group type dining. Possibly better during the week.",5
"Top-notch, all around a phenominal dining experience with exceptional food. Simply outstanding.",4
I had been there for the first time with our clients for dinner and fell in love with the cheese gnocci so I decided I had to come back with my husband to have him experience this little taste of heaven. Upon arrival we were seated immediatly. Our waiter was there immediatly asking us if we would care for a cocktail to start. He then proceeded to tell us the specials and brought over this delicious warm baked bread and what looked like 2 miniature pound cakes that were absolutely delicious.,4
After we ordered it did not take long at all to get our dinner. Everything was brought over right away and our wait staff made sure we had everything we needed before we even asked for it. The service and the food was outstanding!!!,5
"Quality Meats not only lives up to their name on their food, but the unique, contemporary design serves as the perfect hideaway from a hectic neighborhood. Each course topped the next in terms of freshness of the oysters, to perfect sides, and a perfect medium rare buttery filet. The choices are broad enough to include the steakhouse classics, as well as modern american lighter fare. The service was terrific. Our food came out in a timely manner and all together, there was no rush for us to finish our meal, some of the uniquely named items were well explained by our waiter. A definite gem, and you don't have to be a 100% carnivore to appreciate it.",5
We liked this establishment a lot. Food was very good and nice sized portions,5
"We went for Restraurant Week 2009 and had a wonderful lunch. The food was delicious and the desert idea of a dressed up scope of ice cream, was fun. I would go, even if it wasn't restaurant week. Great choice.",5
"Awesome place! Great restaurant week deal! Love the service, food and ambiance..",3
"Food, service, everything was GREAT!  Have recommended it to serveral people and they all loved it.",4
Two steps above the parent chain in enjoyable dining.,5
"I feel that with each subsequent visit, the steak is less and less notable. It isn't bad, just not great, as I remembered it the first visit. It may be that the cuts of meat haven't been as good as the first visit, but I've had 3-5 visits since that first time and I feel the steak is now just average.",2
"It was good lunch with my old friends at Quality meat during the NYC restaurant week event. However, the service wasn't so great. The service could be better.",5
Steak tartare is simply amazing!!! Also loved my Hanger Steak. Great food overall. Highly recommend.,3
"Overall the experience was just ok, certianly not nearly as good as other NYC steakhouses. The restuarant week menu was very small and limited. The food that we did order was good, but nothing I would rave about at all. I asked for my steak medium and it came out completely bloody to where the waiter saw it from across the room, came over and grabbed my steak to send it back without me even asking. They also tried to overcharge us for two sides we ordered....said they ""got confused."" You do this everyday all day, how do get confused with a side of fries?!",5
"I will certainly not be going back to Quality Meats and if someone needs a steak house reccommendation, I will giving them some of the other great places I have eaten.",4
"We will definitely be returning to this restaurant. Everything was spot-on. The presentation, the ample portions, the simple and flavorful presentation of the meat, the wonderful service.. we couldn't design a better steakhouse!",4
It was our first time dinning there and will return soon.,4
"We ate lunch at Quality Meats during restaurant week- you wouldn't have know the meal was cheap! The food was fabulous, the sevice impeccable. We'll go back soon.",3
"Very good- service was not great at the bar, but was once we sat down. Food was presented well and was delicious. I'd definitely recommend it and would go back",3
"Everything was great, except it was very loud. It would be good for a group but if you are looking for a quiet romantic dinner this might not be my first choice. We actually asked to be moved and the manager came over to apologize and told us the whole resturant becomes loud. It was fine and my party had a nice time and they even sent over some complimentary desserts to make up for the noise level. Overall I would recommend it.",4
"Wow, just good food!  Really loved the portobello fries and the butternut squash bisque with gingerbread croutons. Very nice evening out.",5
"Great place to take our red-meat-loving boss visiting from out of town. Definitely a place for guys, especially guys with expense accounts. On the down side, we were a table of three and they seated us in a very awkward spot at the top of stairs into a more private dining area. The tableside prep of the steak sauce was totally lost to us because of the positioning of our table. Don't do the theater unless you have an audience! On the upside, the corn creme brulee was delicious and the steaks very good. Overall though, don't know that I'd go out of my way to make a return visit.",2
"For a steak house, the decor and menu were eclectic and more interesting than most. The service is efficient and attentive. I really enjoyed my appetizer, entree and the amazing heated rolls that are brought to the table. My complaints are that the dessert menu is limited and the restaurant is a bit too noisy. It was very hard to hear my dining companion who was right across the table.",5
rack of lamb for 2 was fantastic as was the corn creme brule,5
"We have been to numerous steakhouses in the city and in the tri-state area but the four of us who dined that evening all agree that Quality Meats is the best steakhouse we have visited and we will certainly return soon. The decor was trendy, the service was excellent and the food was outstanding. My wife and I had the Porterhouse for two and although we loved the freshly made steakhouse, we ate the meat plain as it was perfect and we didn't want to alter the taste. It was perfectly cooked and extremely tender. We can't say enough good things about our experience.",5
"Overall a very subpar experience. The potatoes cooked in duck fat, which were highly recommended, were stale; the lamb chops ok, but way overpriced; the salad fine; the desserts dissapointing and the server unintelligible. The high point was a special bone in filet, which was very good. There are so many great restaurants in Manhattan, that I can't imagine this place staying in business if this experience is shared by others.",2
Dinner was worth every dollar and more!! We will definately return to try other items we didn't have room for!!! The Caesar salad was delicious and the steak melted in your mouth!! Make sure you leave room for dessert because the ice cream is a pure piece of heaven.,5
We had good experience in the past. This time the pasta was not hot and service was marginal.,3
"Very nice interior, but A/C was on maximum and was too cold.",3
Enjoyed lunch!  Food was excellent!  Will not hesitate to recommend and will be back.,5
Overall a wonderful experience of great-tasting food with delicate preparation in a medley of taste. The olive oil for the bread could have been a better quality given the standard of all the other foods.,4
Superb - as always - aside from La Bernadin there's no place better for seafood....,5
"It was our second time at Marea and we were not disappointed. The food was excellent, the service was perfect.",5
"At the beginning of the meal, a chair broke down when one of us sat down. The staff could not have been more attentive and they brought us a couple of free desserts  at the end of the meal. That was a very nice gesture.",5
We will definitely go back.,4
Easily the best food I've ever had in my life. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone and everyone.,5
"My wife and I are from North Carolina.  We eat out a lot in various cities like Chicago and in Raleigh/durham/chapel hill, nc.",5
We thought the atmosphere and service were good.  Food was excellent.  Lots of interesting dishes.,5
"Even for New York we thought the drinks, wine and entrees were over priced.  Shared appetizer, two entrees, 2 glasses of wine each, no desert.  With tip $300.  Seems high by about $50 to $75.",5
A gem tugged away from Hannover St and absolute dining paradise,5
"Wonderful food, ambiance, and terrific wait staff.  We truly enjoyed our meal. Will return when back in NYC.",1
Overall was Very good! Highly recommended!,5
Absolutely incredible meal at Marea and can't wait to head back for another wonderful dinner.,5
"Marea fits so many buckets and five star is one of them.  A most attentive staff without being intrusive.  Perfectly fresh seafood and home made pastas.  Chic, elegant setting whether you are business attire or business casual, Marea is welcoming to all.  Marea is our favorite high-end choice in Midtown!",5
Was really looking forward to dining here. Sadly I got horrible sick after eating here. I had a early lunch knowing how much I'd eat for dinner. We ordered the Chef tasting menu after 2 coarse my wife was full so I ate her portions including my own. After dinner in our hotel room around 2-3am I got violently sick and was sick all night ended up at Mt Sinai hospital getting an IV. We called the restaurant and told them what happened they said they were sorry and will call us back after a investigation. They never returned our call or reached out. Sad this was the one place really wanted to try and ended up running our vacation.,5
Fantastique !!!!,5
Food was delicious; service was lovely; air conditioning was brutal: blowing on us & freezing.,3
"With a guest visiting from out of town, we desired some of the city’s best food. Marea did not disappoint. Each course was delicious, well prepared and appropriately sized. Now, given the many ratings this restaurant holds, it lived up to expectations. The only note was service could have been a bit more personable, but it did not distract from a lovely meal.",5
Great great and great. Beginning to end. Perfect experience. Thank you. The fusilli octopus = another level of great!,5
But main problem was food. ,4
We order aged rib steak and the quality potato.,5
"Steak was average, side sauce taste like regular sauce from shop, house special potato was a joke.",3
"Day before our dinner in Quality meats we was at Gallaghers, totally different story!",3
"Went for lunch with co-workers and had great food, even for vegetarians at a ""steak"" place.  We relaxed and enjoyed the great wine and variety of food.  Definitely on the high end for everyday lunch but well worth it.",3
Great place for steaks!,3
Not available at all to Disabled Access or parents with stroller.,5
"My favorite steak house, but this time the our cut came really burnt and under-spiced. Overall was a pretty disappointing experience especially considering all the previous visits were by far the best ones.",5
I believe restaurants should offer the best tasting food especially that this particular restaurant is so expensive...food is so so and no seasoning at all...it would have made a great difference...we didn't enjoy the food at all...bland and needing sauce or seasoning to make the food shine.,5
Very bad service but great food.,3
I love meats which is why I wanted to try this place since I read a lot of amazing reviews about it. ,5
"I went there for a date and it was phenomenal. Starting from the place it self all the way to the service and food. We order the 10oz filet mignon and the baby ribs with a side of créame spinach, grilled mushrooms  and ñoqui which were unbelievable tasty. The steak was cook exactly how I wanted.  As dessert we order the smoke marshmallow ice cream to share which was something I was looking for to try after all the reviews I have read about this plate, and I can say now that they were absolutely right recomending this dessert. Over all  Beautiful place , Great Service and food. The manager Adrian and the servers were always on top of everything making sure this night was special and it definitely was. I am very thankful for such an amazing experience.",5
"This is one of our favorite restaurants in NYC. Good service, excellent food. Of course the stars in the menu are the meat cuts. Sides are also notable, specially the sweet corn brûlée. This time our visit was tainted by a very loud table near us that made impossible to have a civilized conversation. We invited a friend that was also visiting New York and the noise level made the experience annoying. But definitely a great restaurant to go, always!",5
Quality Meats  is now our traditional first-night-in-NY meal and it is brilliant. As always.,5
Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fareのラミレスシェフの推薦で行きました。シェフの推薦のリブアイはメニューになく、フィレを10oz食べましたが、、それほどではない、フツーでした。。,5
Was recommended by a friend.. so delicious.. service was impeccable! Will be back,1
"Great dining experience. Group of 4 had steaks, veal chop and short ribs along with some sides (corn cream brûlée is fabulous) and a bunch of deserts. Couldn't ask for better service",3
"As always , outstanding !!!",5
Always great!  Our go-to steak house in the city.  Only minor issue remains the way that they have  stacked the two-top tables on top of each other in here.  You really have no choice but to visit with your neighbors (as they are essentially at your table).  Makes a private business dinner conversation almost impossible.,5
Love dining at QM.  The ribeye steak is wonderful!!!,5
"With so many great options in NYC we were sorry we chose this one. The steak was decent. The sides were barely OK. The bar served me a lemon drop with an extra thick rim of salt (should have been sugar). They put 4 mini rolls on our table and before we could each eat one of them they were taking the other 2 away so they could put sides on our extra small table.  So rushed, so cluttered. There was probably 6-7"" between our table and the next one. The creme brûlée corn was sickeningly sweet. Then to top it off the manager greatly offended the guy sitting next to us like he was someone that walked in off the street and sat himself when the hostess had. The whole thing was handled so poorly. It made for an uncomfortable dining experience. We would have left if we hadn't already been served our food. This place needs help!",4
"Third time dining here, each time back the experience and food is less enjoyable. Overall the steak flavor and taste is no longer above average.  They did away with the  rib eye and now sell rib steak which is a tougher meat. The appetizers rank only moderately  with the exception of the seafood. The waiters and attendants treat you like your a tourist . Which at this point  the amount of past success QM has had since their initial opening. That's pretty much how you will be served nothing special going on.  NYC has many places were you can spend 1k for a night out for 5 people and be much happier.",5
Outstanding service & excellent food. Absolutely fantastic night. Wouldn't hesitate to return or recommend.,5
My son declared that the filet mignon that he ate here was the best he's ever tasted!  The food was truly outstanding.  I had the lobster scampi appetizer which was enough along with all of the sides and appetizers that we ordered.  The baby back ribs were unlike none that I've ever had - marinated in a light citrus sauce - not heavy.  Our server was terrific - friendly and really helpful in choosing what to order.  I would definitely come back to Quality Meats again and again.,5
A somewhat traditional steak joint with a great intimate atmosphere and extraordinary culinary options on the menu that pleased even the pickiest of palates in our family.  It was walking distance from our hotel (near Times Square but thankfully not in it) and had a great vibe and excellent service. Would definitely eat here again.,5
"It was decent. Definitely not the best steakhouse or would I even qualify it as a steakhouse, rather just a fine dining establishment.  Definitely would not recommend if you are looking for a steakhouse experience.  Service was great. Food was ok.",2
A great place for dinner. Highly recommend. Staff provided exceptional customer service and the food was the best I've had in NYC.,1
Loved it.  Food was fantastic and the atmosphere is really neat. Noise level is a bit high. Def be back.,4
"As always, great food and good service!",3
"It was an exceptional dining experience.  Fortunately for us, we were seated upstairs and in a smaller (and nicely quieter) area than the overall restaurant.  That is the reason I did not mark 5 stars for noise level as the main parts of the restaurant were very noisy and acoustics were poor and did not handle the noise well enough for my liking.",2
"In the past have had wonderful meals and service at this restaurant.  This visit was not one of those occasions.   So crowded that service and food suffered.  Perhaps a one time disappointment.  My advice would be that if you really want a first class experience,  you try to pick a time when they are less busy or go to another restaurant.",5
We ordered the 3 filets medium rare.  They were all different sizes and none of them were cooked to temperature.  I informed the restaurant we would not be paying for the meat entree. Their response was less than impressive.  We paid for our cocktail and bottle of wine appetizer and side of spinach and left.   We are foodies and had dinner at Jean George and Le Bernadin on the 2 days preceding this experience.  We were not expecting the experience of either of these restaurants but we expected to get what we ordered.  Needless to say we will never patronize this restaurant again.  I took photos and was asked not to post them.,1
"Great food , Great staff . We would visit again as family had a a very enjoyable meal",5
The restaurant looks very good. Good food but too pricy for what you get. Should be 25% less.,5
Really underwhelmed by rib eye.. just didn't taste a patch on a hawkesmoor.. plus not cheap in the slightest.. wouldn't go back,5
Sides are good but again very pricey for what it is..,3
Wonderful atmosphere; great wine selection and superb steak and seafood.,4
Meat was half cooked. We asked for medium and it was made rare. My date complained. Not happy about it.,5
Great place must go!!!! Filet mignon is a must have!,3
"Quality Meats was fabulous!! The food, decor and service were far above outstanding. Be sure to have the homemade ice cream!",5
"Despite the judgmental front desk people, this restaurant is absolutely amazing. The food is great and our waitress Darnell made our trip amazing and worthy.  This totally compensated the bad impression we had when we entered.",3
"Food is well done, with nice presentation and it tastes great. Worthy of the 2 Michelin stars.",5
there seem to be some lack of service/variety/flexibility for the price. great atmosphere.,3
"Aside from one of the managers (a young woman), the service was very slow and not very accommodating. Must have been inexperience. The steaks were not cooked properly and lacked were bad cuts. We were charged for cocktails that were never served and the waiter seemed totally oblivious.",2
"Overall I would say the place is very over rated and not on par with the many ""old school"" steakhouses in Manhattan.",4
"This restaurant is a most welcomed addition to the neighborhood. The scene is somewhat lively and energetic, with a softened twist on the upscale steakhouses of yore. In particular, I found the servers to be both knowledgeable and helpful, and particularly so regarding cuts of meat, etc, as well them introducing a great wine steward. We'll definitely return to this place again.",3
Ambiance and service was great. Bone marrow and beet salad were fantastic. However the steak........supposedly the main draw to the place.........was just so-so. It did not appear to be 'quality' meat which i assumed would be dry aged beef.,4
I think that the corking fee charged is too expensive (US 35). Most restaurants charge US 15-20 .....,4
"We went for my birthday. Food and service were excellent and they brought us two complimentary flutes of champagne becaues they knew we were celebrating. Also wrote ""Happy birthday"" in chocolate on the rim of the plate with our apple tart and put a candle in a puff of whipped cream, too. Make sure to show your Fourth Wall VIP card if you have one, that entitled us to a free pint of homemade ice cream to take home.",4
First time I visited the steaks were so so. This time however the porter house for two was on the money. Just as good as the other favorite ny spots. The charcutterie plate was so so. The milk chocolate tart was outrageous. All in all a great meal and a great steak.,4
Great Wine selection and friendly service.,2
"The service was excellent. Given the prcing and the buzz, I expected a lot more for the money in terms of food and atmosphere. I would rate it a ""B"" relative to other midtown restraunts. Nothing was really special.",5
"My husband and I went based on the location and the zagat ratings and we couldn't have been happier. The food was great, ambiance was perfect for our anniversary celebration, and the service staff was friendly and attentive. Thank you!",4
"The steaks were great! The salads need some work, bland and lacked any type of creativity. Also, please add sauteed mushrooms to the menu. Oh, nice wine specials for the evening at a resonable price. This restaurant will go on my list of places to revisit.",3
Steak somewhat disappointing. Rest of the food only so so for the price. Hip crowd but don't go for the steak experience.,4
Had a great time/meal!!! Delicious food!,3
I enjoyed my first visit to Quality Meats better than this last dining experience.  We were seated in a room with a few other tables of people and one table was beyond the normal noise level.  The food did not wow me this time as well. I would try it again.,3
The tables that they have for 2 people are postage size and the plates are large. They make a steak sauce and serve it in a separate bowl and if you order any sides you barely have room on the table for your wine and water glasses. There are a lot of great places for steak and this one is just an OK one of many in NYC.,4
my favorite steak house!,4
"Great food, great service, quality recommendations... Very happy.",4
"Loved the atmosphere and dinner was excellent. Crab cake was fabulous, as was the farmer's salad. Sirloin was cooked to perfection, and the sticky toffee pudding was decadent. This was our first time here and we will be back.",5
Always good. Double Rib Steak exceptional.... as were all of the dishes. This steak house never takes a night off.... its well priced and there is value here. Kudos!,5
"The food was incredibly good and service was superb! The noise upstairs, because of the way the room was re done, it was too loud, we could barely hear ourselves talking, unless we yelled. The room needs to have carpet or big decorations somewhere to reduce the noise...the brick does not help.",3
"We loved the food and service, but we are not planning on going back (we only visit NY twice a year), because of the level of noise, unfortunately we cannot recommend it to our friends.",4
"If you ever fix the noise problem, please let us know, we'll visit again :)",3
Andrea,4
Very good salads and the parm fries rock.,5
"This place is at the top of the list with the best NYC steakhouses. Ribsteak is amazing. Only knock: poor selection of sides. Prices are not cheap, built for business accounts, but worth it.",4
excruciating noise level but food good,5
I'm still thinking about that steak and the gnocchi!,4
"From appetizers to dessert, everything was delicious and beautifully presented. After the meal, we learned that it was the busiest Saturday they had, and it was not even noticeable. We especially enjoyed the oysters and the rib eye. The service was as good as the meal.",4
"terrific meal all around....great service, great food, great restaurant design....wonderful place for dinner or a drink...",4
i've eaten at may steak houses. This was a great experience. Better than sparks (both food and service and much more romantic). If you wany a great steak than go here.,4
"Good food, fun ambiance. The meal was actually out very quickly, maybe a little too quickly! But it was a good experience.",4
Great recommendation for dinner. We celebrated a special birthday and the staff catered to us! A little noisy but we still had fun!,5
"Steaks were perfectly cooked given the various cuts of meet our table ordered. A nice crisp char with a juicy taste. Perfect balance. The sides were fit for the menu, but not a distraction from the center piece---the steak!",4
"I was surprised at how packed the restaurant was on a Monday night. The service was excellent, the food delicious and desert was amazing.",4
"We all enjoyed the meal. There was plenty of food, and you could get more on the side dishes if you wanted. Everything was delicious. Except the price. I thought they could have thrown in coffee and tea at the end. Instead they charged $5.25 for a cup of tea or coffee. A bit chintzy! That should have been included in the price.",3
"I'd describe my experience as disappointing...I had an excellent dinner there a while ago. Food was amazing. Pasta was probably the best I had in Manhattan. This time, I went for lunch with family. The Fusilli pasta with braised octopus & bone marrow was really salty. Server didn't come over and ask how everything was. If he did, I'd tell him it wasn't as good as I expected. (I had a high expectation). ",5
"Don't really understand why there's a different between lunch / dinner. With that said, I would still recommend people to go for dinner but will also let them know of my lunch experience so that they can make their judgment.",5
"Absolutely excellent!! Beginning to end this was one of the best meals I've ever had accompanied by excellent service. Which was attentive but not fussy. Amazingly well prepared dishes, nothing overcooked or annoyingly frivolous ingredients   just for the sake of having them in the dish.  Special thanks to Kent our server whom helped make the evening better by making sure we wanted for nothing and all our dishes arrived to our table with military precision.",3
The dining experience was amazing from the  appetizers to the main course it was spot on.  I would definitely go back again. Their hostess  Gulshatt was amazing  treating us like family.,5
Way overpriced. Food delicious but extremely small portions.,5
"This is probably our 12th time here.  It is always great.  The service, the ambiance and of course the FOOD.  If you haven't been here-go.  I would recommend Marea to anyone who enjoys find dining in a beautiful setting.",5
Excellent.  The pasta is really special. Everything was great,5
"We had a terrific anniversary dinner, loved every aspect of the experience.",4
"Make reservation aprox 20 days prior and I got a table next to the bar, really noise. Didn't enjoy!",5
Overall great experience. The food is delicious. I highly recommend the fusilli with bone marrow and octopus. It was amazing with a ton of flavor! The oxtail pasta was also a big hit.,5
"I took my girlfriend for her birthday on September 20th 2017 with great expectacions. First of all the expectations were surpassed in every way, the atmosphere make you feel special, great service, superb food and wine list. This restaurant really impressed us, thanks Marea team.",5
It was great vibe for friend reunion,5
"Amazing experience, amazing food and amazing service.",5
"Portions ,particularly appetizer  and pasta course on pre-fix were small.",4
Excellent experience with superior food and service.,4
This restaurant truly represents what you'd expect from NYC fine dining.,5
I'd eat here every day If I were wealthy:),4
"Love, love this steakhouse. Amazing service.",5
"My family and I had a wonderful Thanksgiving meal here. They were very accomodating, and the food was excellent. Highlights were definitely the Steak Tartare, the Lobster Bisque, and the Short Ribs.",5
Great steaks. Enjoyed the Bone Marrow as well. Sides of Parmesan fries and Yorkshire Creamed Spinach added a little spin on the usual fries and greens.,5
Fantastic and waiter was amazing,5
"Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous!  High energy, great staff, food divine and the best Lemon Cake we’ve ever had!  Don’t miss out...book now!",5
Wonderful all around!,5
For some reason could not get the $60 steak cooked correctly .,3
Food is delicious! Service was a bit slow but it’s a very busy restaurant so it was expected. Very Loud but great. One problem though we found a hair in our lobster Mac. Huge disappointment. But they did apologize and make us a new one.,4
"Great NY restaurant. Excellent food, classy atmosphere. They bend over backwards to make everything perfect. Sarah D...ask for her, great server.",5
I’ve been to here several times during  holiday season and I have to say this is probably my worst experience,3
First of all the tables are too close to each other the staff is stressed out and you can tell just by the amount of people in the room that is definitely unsafe if there was ever to be a fire no way you’d be able to get out,5
The wait for the food was totally unacceptable I appreciate that they put Dessert on the house because of the wait  but because we got our dinner so late we missed the viewing of the tree  lights went off on the tree at 11 PM now we have to book another trip back into New York City just so we can go see the tree,3
It just seems like they’re trying to put as many people in the restaurant during the holiday season which is definitely a fire hazard table should not be on top of each other to the point where nobody can get out comfortably from their seat,5
All that aside even though we waited a long time to eat I have to tell you that the food is still absolutely amazing our steaks came out piping hot to the point that if we touch the plates it would’ve probably taken skin off my hands all the sides were excellent and I have to say that the waiter did the best job he could give in the amount of stress I’m sure he was under,5
I’m sorry to say this but given my last experience I don’t think I’ll be coming back there during the holiday season,5
This resturant never disapoints our steaks and sides were awesome.,5
"Excellent seafood, overrated steak.  Very good service & wines.  One of those places that people go that want to be seen.  Overall, with all the great places to dine in the city I'd give it a 6 out of 10.",5
Brian & Sarah provided impeccable service that made an incredible meal even better!,5
Food was impeccable and the service was great. Mood and ambiance was perfect.,5
"We arrived 30mins after our reservation and time and were seated within 10mins. All the staff was very welcoming and hospitable. The food was cooked perfectly, would definitely come again!",5
Tuna was stringy- but everything else was great! Waiter was wonderful. He choose to take my meal off the bill.,5
Manager and server went above and beyond my expectations to make sure I was completely satisfied with my meal after I didn’t feel my steak was meeting my expectations..They definitely pride themselves on excellence and it was greatly appreciated to feel like they cared about more than our money..they exchanged out my steak and our sides afterwhich I was very much satisfied and to top it off had the chocolate soufflé and butter cake that were to die for !,2
"Del Frisco is always a great meal in NYC.  We have eaten there on several trips that we make to the city.  The food and service are always great.  It is a bit noisy, but it is a great New York Experience that will provide you first class steak, wine, dessert and crab cakes.",5
It was awesome,5
Service was spectacular and the rib eye bone in was superb,5
"Made reservations several days before on open table and received confirmation right away.  Mentioned in the special instructions box it was for a birthday celebration.  That night we got there, we were seated earlier than our 6:00pm appointment.  It was a full house of people at the bar and the restaurant.  Such a happening spot!  Got seated in a comfortable booth and was quickly served by Kathleen who was an exceptional waitress who tended to us with such energy.  She knew her wines  and menu well and was able to assist me in deciding what to order.  Thank goodness since there was too much to decide on. We ended ordering the 16 oz, 45 day aged prime rib and the 16 oz classic rib eye.  The quality of the steaks were amazing!  The aged meat was tasty and flavorful!  The classic was so good as you can taste more of the meat flavor.  Both are based on preference. Sides ordered, charred octopus and roasted",5
"Brussels sprouts were so tender and delish!  Ordered a bottle of Malbec also recommended by sommelier Kathleen and she was spot on!  For dessert we were so full that we were going to pass but she surprised us with a lemon crunch piece of cake with a candle!  How special as this place pays attention to their customers and really are highly customer service based!  The only thing was this place is loud, feels like you are at a party. But, that was the fun of it!",3
Amazingly noisy place.  Deafening! During the entire meal all participants at table got bumped by passing traffic. To compound matters the servers got the order wrong. The took a very long time to fix. Too many other steak houses in NYC to bother going back.,3
Whenever I’m in NYC my husband and always eat at Del Frisco. We enjoyed the food and the view at night. Great food and service as always!,5
Birthday. The service is some of the best I’ve had. The attention to detail was incredible! My friend got a signed birthday card from the servers and we were touched by the gesture!,5
It was good,5
Tomahawk steak is a must have,5
"The food was excellent, however after ordering it took over an hour to receive it. We were told it take about 30 mins because of the steaks. Our food arrived so late and caused the group to be late to a broadway show. We had to leave the restaurant running.",2
Even at lunch there is a long wait to be seated and the service is still slow without a crowd.,4
"It was Great Wagyu!!! I love this stake and will surely recommend this to Many people, especially Japanese since I am from Tokyo.",2
"I made a reservation on Open Table and said that I would like a round table and it was for a special occasion. Not only did they accommodate a larger group than we anticipated, but also gave us a spectacular corner table. Between the ambience and the service, this is one of my new favorite places in the city.",4
Thanks!,5
Second time back at this place and enjoyed every bit of it,5
"Had an awesome waitress, first time taking kids and it was amazing.",3
"I was disappointed regarding the service and some aspects of the food here.  Besides the bread guy, it took almost 25 minutes for a server to stop by and check in on us (there was a vip at the table next to us and a bunch of kids at another table close by).  The meat options are just the meat- no veggies or anything accompanying it (I have been to other restaurants of similar caliber and style and they have always had at least something small accompanying it). The Mac and cheese was sparse with its lobster portion (But it was still pretty good). The only thing that saves the evening was the dessert waitress, she was awesome and the dessert was amazing (Butter cake- not what we were originally thinking of ordering but it was actually one of the most amazing dessert I’ve had).  I would not choose to come back here, you can tell that this is a place that used to be amazing but has since fallen down hill a bit.",4
"Good as usual. However, two of the Steaks were undercooked. They got them right the second time. Excellent service and great lively ambiance.",5
The waiter charged a different amount from our credit card than we signed for. Apparently to get a higher tip. This is flat out theft. Very bad. We still have the signed credit card slip with a different amount.,5
"Great food, Great Service.  We were seated early as we arrived early.  Steaks were perfectly done.  The onion rings are huge.  Will come again.",4
Everything was absolutely fantastic. I come here often and its always this good. Highly recommended.,5
It's a steakhouse and they do deliver. Done to perfection and full of flavor. Will go back next time in NYC.,4
OUR WAITRESS AMBER WAS GREAT VERY DETAIL TO THE MENUE. THE RES. HOST GREAT THEY FORGOT MY BROCCOLLI AND HE CAME OUT HIMSELF TO DELIVER IT TO OUR TABLE. APOLOGIZING I DIDNT SEE THE BIG DEAL CAUSE I JUST MENTIONED THEY FORGOT. BUT THEY MADE IT IT SHOWS THATTHE SERVIC EIS OUTSTANDING AND THE FOOD THE ONE OF THE BEST.,5
Good place if you have a lot of money to spend. Ridiculously expensive and average food (steak). Service was wonderful and very friendly employees.,3
"We've been twice before and loved it both times. The service is always spectacular. This time, however, the crab cakes were lukewarm and the gnocchi was indifferent, certainly not to the level one expects in Manhattan on a Saturday night. That being said, we'll no doubt give them another chance solely due to the charming staff.",4
Crab was dry but all other services were perfect.,3
"When initially walking into the restaurant, you seemed to get stuck into a crowd that is waiting to be seated. That rings off a bell to let you know that you have to make a reservation to eat here unless you'd like to wait for a couple of hours to get seated. I went to this restaurant a couple of days ago and even though the restaurant was full to what seemed to be it's max, the employees found my girlfriend and I a nice seat, away from the big groups of people and in a booth by ourselves. The service was absolutely amazing and when the food arrived on the table, we understood why this place was so busy. The crab cakes are to die for, the sauteed mushrooms are incredible, the Mignon, Lobster and Porterhouse is absolutely amazing as well.",5
The best -- an unbelievable dining experience set in the most amazing space in New York. Always a fantastic evening.,5
Great steak place in a great location. Some tables are definitely better than others. Be careful with a table in the far back room - very tight.,4
Great steak! The steak is reasonably priced for NYC- the sides are pricey but overall its well worth the experience!,4
Awesome experience! Greatest steak ever. Not noisy on Sunday PM.,5
great steaks - especially the filet and the onion rings,4
Great food and service as always!,5
"I find Del Frisco's consistently excellent. The food and the service are reliably very high quality. My guest and I split a filet and a 14 oz lobster tail, with a pair of excellent sides (one corn, one potato). The manager offered us complimentary desserts because we were seated next to a large group, and he thought we might have been distracted by them. Nice touch - a hallmark of Del Frisco's.",4
"too noisy ,midtown business lunch, expensive for what you get they ran out of steak?? would never go again unless it was an business lunch on expenses.",2
"We had a great time, the food is just too expensive!",3
Great food!! Service was pretty good. One thing we didn't like was the fact that they seated my wife and I in a huge booth that faced the whole bar and surrounding tables. We felt like we were eating in a fish bowl. Hard to completely enjoy your meal when you have 60 people drinking at the bar and looking at you. Otherwise it was a great dining experience. Will definitely be going back.,4
outstanding dinner and service.,5
"My second visit. Steaks are absolutely THE BEST. Pricey, yes, but food and service is outstanding. Our side of onion rings (superb!!!) were late, maybe two minutes after steak arrived at the table. They were instantly taken off the bill. I didn't even think about it, but someone, not the waiter, came up to the table and explained that wasn't acceptable and off the bill they went. Ok by me! They were delicious! Good bottle of wine, at $165 it should be, but hey, it was my choice, no pressure.",5
"The manager came by twice. Nice touch, service was perfect.",4
"Yes I'm sure someone, somewhere, at sometime, will complain, but I will be back. No question!",4
"It's Grand Central Station at peak hours but who cares...steaks are outstanding, so are the crab cakes..service is incredibly attentive. I'll be there many more times...",5
"This was our first time dining at Del Frisco's and we had the filet mignon so we could compare it to other upper crust steakhouses we had visited in other states. The steaks were outstanding and the family-style side dishes were also good. I consider this restaurant near the top of my list of places to dine in New York City. The place is VERY noisy, though, so don't expect a romantic evening or even a lively conversation. They have a large wine list, but I was disappointed with the suggestion of the Sommelier, as it was not worth the rather steep price. I wish I had stayed with my gut and selected a good wine at a more reasonable price. Overall, I left happy and content and will return in the future.",5
Excellent food and Excellent service. I would happily go here again.,5
The whole dining experience was excellent. From the moment we sat down until we were done. I will definitely be returning and recommending this restaurant.,4
"Fabulous, fabulous service. Great dining experience. Great food. Would definiately go back. Pricey for normal folks, but for a special occasion, it was perfect.",5
"Wonderful and favorable food, excellent service, impressive wine list and pricing that goes along with all that. Not for the faint heart where the wallet is concerned. Very accommodating and knowledgeable wait staff. Visited after a show in early evening, before the true dinner group, so noise level was quite moderate, easy to talk with others at the table.",5
Excellent food and service. The waitress forgot to inform us that the spinach had bacon in it. The dish was served by someone else who told us about the bacon. The waitress did not charge us for the dish and apologized at the end of the meal.,5
I had to change the reservation for a later time. The hostess knew who i was and confirmed that it was the birthday dinner for my son immediately. It was very nice that she knew her reservations for that night or at least she made me believe that she did.,4
The food was excellent. My boys and her 2 friends told me that it was their best meal in New York so far.,4
"Excellent strip steak, creamed spinach and mashed potatoes that I was still thinking about days later!",4
"Great meal, great atmosphere! Special occasions are best because the place is expensive. However, it is worth it!",3
very nice for business lunch. staff was tuned to our needs and timeliness,5
"Food and service were excellent. Decor is a little less stuffy/old men's club than many of the premium steak house chains. The menu is fairly traditional primo steakhouse; not very adventurous or innovative. Bar scene, apparently dominated by the investment banking after-work crowd, was hopping. What recession?",5
"The only drawback was that it was quite noisy. Since I have been to other Del Frisco's that are not particualry noisy, this is caused in NY because of the accoustics of the room. Very high ceiling, lots of glass and marble flooring. I think that given the space, they have all that was possible to dampen the noise.",4
"Excellent quality steaks. Good service however,could use more finess service wise. Need attention to details.",5
"very professional, knowledgable wait-staff. The attention made us feel a bit rushed, though they apologized and said we should take our time. Not sure if they meant it. Food was very good and place had a very busy business-meeting feel.",3
My favorite steak place in the city.  You have to try the to die for 8 layer lemon cake!,5
This was our first time to the restaurant and could not have imagined a better experience any where else. We were treated like royalty from the time we set foot in the restaurant to the time we left. We had three cuts of steak (done top perfection) and the homestyle side dishes were more than ample.,4
"My first choice was to take my peers from France to STK as I thought it would be a more enjoyable experience overall. We were not able to secure reservations for STK so I chose Del Friscos because of the proximity to Times Square and the desire of my peers to eat great beef. We were fortunate to have a great server on a very busy Saturday night who made our experience thoroughly enjoyable. The food if not a tad bit over priced even for Midtown was very well prepared, and extremely tasty. The steaks were perfectly prepared and the Chilean Sea Bass was excellent. All the sides were ample and very tasty. The wine list is sizeable and well appointed. This is a great place for a special event or parties of 5 or more.",5
Amazing and wonderful service. Love the location close to Rockefeller center and across from radio city music hall .,5
"The food and service were excellent, but the space is wide open and very loud. Not much opportunity for quiet conversation.",4
We couldn't fly our daughter back home to San Diego for Thanksgiving as she just started a new job after graduating NYU.  We sent her a Del Frisco's ecard for her and her roommate to have a nice dinner for Thanksgiving.  They both loved it and were so happy to celebrate Thanksgiving with an amazing meal and great cocktails! They said the atmosphere was festive and had a great time!  Del Frisco's never disappoints!,5
Packed....made reservation a month in advance for 8pm at 9:45 we just left.,1
"The food was excellent and our sever was brilliant, but we waited an hour from our reservation time to be seated and you can't go and get a drink elsewhere in the interim because their system of notifying you that your table is ready involves cramming waiting diners into a space the size of an elevator and then having a series of front of house staff scream names in a manner so shrill that passing dogs clutch their ears in pain.",3
We had reservations on Thanksgiving for a special meal followed by theatre tickets. When we arrived the reception area was in chaos. People were packed in yelling at the staff. The person next to where I was standing advised that his reservation was over 1.5 hours prior and he still had not been seated. The hostess walked past and I asked her if it was true they were running more than 1.5 hours behind. When she said yes I told her my group could not stay . She asked what my name was to cancel my reservation. No apology or explanation offered. I would like to add that I had received a call the day before confirming my reservation. Since it was too late to get in anywhere else we had our Thanksgiving meal at a dinner around the corner sitting on stools while dressed for Del Friscos. Very disappointing to say the least. It ruined our Thanksgiving.,1
"What a pity, our party of eight were told upon arrival for Thanksgiving Dinner on time that we would have to wait at least an hour before our name would be called , no explanation given .",1
Our reservation confirmed days in advance.,5
"No consideration for the customer, total disaster for many others as well !",5
"Our dinner was on Thanksgiving Day and it was the first time that we had Thanksgiving dinner away from home. I must say that it was an exceptional experience! We enjoyed it completely from the drinks at the bar to the beautiful ambience, service and , of course, food!",1
"Hands down the best meal I’ve ever had.... so so good! The steak was so delicious that I didn’t want my meal to finish! Atmosphere was amazing, staff were super friendly even though there was literally hundreds of people waiting for tables. We ate on Thanksgiving & had made the reservation a month previous, as we were travelling from Ireland. We were so happy that we made such a good choice.",1
"Had a reservation for 5 for thanksgiving dinner. Didn’t get seated until 1.5 hours after the reservation time. During the wait they didn’t even bring out water or drinks for people and we were packed in the waiting area like it was 530pm on the 6 train on a weekday. They ran out of turkey and the dessert on the thanksgiving menu. The timing of the food service wasn’t coordinated. Some of us got our mains 10 minutes before others. The food came out without the correct silverware and we had to ask multiple times. My medium rare steak was cold in the middle (not even room temperature, actually like refrigerator cold). Also had to ask multiple times for drink orders. They were overbooked and overwhelmed. They comped our first round of drinks but it was still a really bad dining experience especially since we had out of town guests with us. We felt embarrassed for bringing them to the restaurant.",2
"Absolutely dreadful. Having done a lot of research we booked for Thanksgiving Dinner 2 months ahead. Arrived to utter chaos to be advised our table was at least an hour late and to go to the bar, worked our way through the crowd to the bar,  nowhere to sit and met people at 7:30 still waiting for their 6:15 table. Stuff didn’t care, felt like cattle at a cattle market. So disappointing. We left quickly and found a lovely place a few blocks away.",1
"We went to Del Frisco's in NYC for Thanksgiving.  What a disaster!  They overbooked their reservations and everyone was livid.  We had a 7:00 pm reservation and we were not seated until 8:30 pm.  To make matters worse they had run out of turkey!!!  While their steaks are very good, some of us wanted turkey!!!  Our server was wonderful.  We felt sorry for the staff. They were put in a difficult situation by their management.  Steer clear of this place on a holiday.",2
"Thanksgiving dinner.  We had a confirmed reservation at 7pm, even called them to re-confirm the day before.  The place was way overbooked.  There were too many people waiting, and all mad.  We waited and were seated at 8:20 pm!  So we waited almost 90 minutes for our confirmed reservation., which is totally unacceptable.  This seemed to be the case for everyone.  Very, very disappointed that the reservations were overbooked.  Unbelievable for such a good restaurant.",3
"Food was excellent, service was outstanding once seated.",1
I would not trust again for special occasion.,1
"Very disappointing.  We had 6:30p reservation and waited 1 1/2 hours to be seated after numerous time checking in and promised to be seated soon.  We were not the only ones, every guest had this issues unless......",1
"Three of our party ordered the prix fixe dinner, items substituted because out of the item or the item did not appear on the plate.  They also ordered the pumpkin cheesecake and were given plain cheesecake with sprinkled cinnamon on top with Carmel sauce.   Totally disorganized chaos",1
This used to be our favorite NYC steakhouse. ,4
We were VERY disappointed that they overbooked the seating for Thanksgiving by hours. We made our reservation way in advance and arrived early. Our reservation was also confirmed by phone the day before. We were told that they were running a little bit late. 20-35 mins. We were finally seated after a 1 1/2 hour wait.  There were many other loyal and unhappy patrons waiting with their families as well. Once seated the service and food was as good as always but that was not enough. Luckily there are MANY excellent restaurants in NYC to choose from which do not overbook. We will miss DelFrisco’s but Thanksgiving is a important meal and intentional overbooking is not forgivable.,1
they overbooked everybody worst experience,1
Ruined Thanksgiving evening. 6:30 reservation still not seated at 7:50. Walked out. Terribly overbooked. Don't know if on purpose or computer error. Will not ever book with them again.,2
"Not at all what I would’ve expected. The hosts sat us 45 minutes after our reservation, after seating 3 groups with the same time slot AHEAD of us. It wasn’t until I glared for the 10th time that they realized they had made a mistake. There was clearly open tables but they only had one or two bussers working. When we got to the table we had a waiter wait on us, then totally disappeared without even announcing it to us, followed by another lovely server coming and taking care of us which is honestly the only reason this review isn’t one star. The food was good, but I would not say it was spectacular. There was too much of a delay between courses when the restaurant wasn’t even that busy when we finally had gotten seated. We were seated at roughly 10:15 and didn’t get out of there until midnight. Really frustrating to have a restaurant be so inconsiderate of your time and not even acknowledge the fact that they made mistakes.",3
"Fabulous night out at Marea.  The food, the wine, and the service were all first rate. The fish dishes, Marea's specialty, were all very tasty! Would highly recommend the Astice (lobster, burrata antipasti) , the Strozzapreti (lump crab pasta), Aragosta (lobster risotto), and the Ippogloso (halibut), to name just a few. The four course tasting menu, priced at $106, is  more than reasonable considering the generous portion sizes and the high quality of the food. Marea is distinctly upscale, but not at all stuffy.  The room is quiet. This was much appreciated as one older member of our party doesn't hear well.  Even for us younger folks, not having to scream across the table in order to be heard was a welcome relief. Fine dining at its best!",5
"Arrived with my family at 5.45pm for a 6.15pm reservation yesterday (thanksgiving). Was told I would be slightly delayed. Ended up being seated at 7.30pm.  The place was a zoo., with the entrance/stairs and bar all completely blocked up with people who had clearly been waiting a long time.  The staff blamed it on people taking longer than expected.   Give me a break. Do you really not know how to manage a reservations list?",1
"Not sure how many thanksgivings were ruined last night, but for a top class restaurant, this was a truly amateur experience. ",1
We went to Keens for thanksgiving last year and had a fantastic experience.,5
"I do not normally write reviews but our experience was significantly bad enough to warrant a review.  This restaurant is normally one of my favorites, so the experience I expected was based on previous meals here.  However, if this experience was my first, there is no doubt that I would not be returning.  We made reservations for Thanksgiving dinner.  Upon arrival, we were shocked to see the restaurant...People were waiting on the stairs, sitting on the floor, just everywhere... standing room only does not even describe it.   We had a 6:15 reservation... we were not seated until 7:40.    While I had hoped for a beautiful meal overlooking the city, we were seated in a dark back room at a table that was obviously haphazardly placed against a door just to squeeze in more seating.  Our server then informs us that they had run out of several items on the ""Pre Fixe"" Thanksgiving menu.  Neither the server nor the host/manager made any mention of or apology for the horrible experience, which neither could deny we (and most other guests) were having.  Not even a complimentary drink.   The only positive thing I can say is that the food was delicious. Extremely disappointing experience at one of my favorite restaurants in New York.",2
"Our reservation was on Thanksgiving Evening at 6 PM.  The restaurant was backed up, understandably it was a holiday.  The host, set us up with free cocktails while we waited over an hour for our table.  The restaurant staff made an otherwise inconvenience very enjoyable.  We relaxed and made friends.  Had a fabulous dinner.  Portions are huge.",5
It was thanksgiving and was over crowded. Service was mediocre the food wasn't prepared correctly no they ran out of stuffing. Overall it was very commercialized and rushed and with the cost you would expect much more. We've gone there several times ma it seems to continue to get worse.,4
Thanksgiving meal was awful. Turkey was dry.,5
Way to crowded.  Could not even get in the door.  Waited an hour to be seated with reservations .,5
I have been going to Del Frisco’s for about 20 years (started going  to Del Frisco’s in Fort Worth and Dallas). I have been to the NYC Del Frisco’s many times for both business and family occasions. ,1
The experience my family and I had on Thanksgiving night could not have been worse and was truly inexcusable. ,4
"We had a reservation for 5 people for 5:30 PM. After checking numerous times and involving Manny the manager, we were finally seated at 6:30 PM - 1 hour late. ",4
"The staff and our waitress were incredibly overtaxed. Del Frisco’s has clearly overbooked the restaurant and were scrambling. The restaurant lobby was a madhouse, people were packed shoulder to shoulder waiting to check on their reservations. ",5
"When we were finally seated the meal started off fine, oysters, appetizers and wine were all good for my wife, my 3 kids and I.",3
"Things went downhill rapidly when the steaks arrived and my wife’s steak and my steak were undercooked. We sent the steaks back and both were returned still undercooked so we sent them back, again, and I asked that both steaks be replaced with new steaks. When the new steaks were presented, my wife’s was acceptable but still undercooked, and mine was completely undercooked. At that point I said “no more”. I had them remove my steak and told them I was done. Although they offered to cook me a new steak, I was finished and had lost my appetite. The staff tried hard to recover but it was too late. ",5
In the end the manager comp’d our entire meal. That was probably the most disappointing part because at the beginning of the night I had an expectation that I was going to spend $600-700 for my family’s Thanksgiving dinner and receive in kind a great experience similar to what we had come to expect after visiting Del Frisco’s over so many years. ,5
"The manager gave me his card but not once did he ask for my name, my email address or my phone number so that he or someone else from Del Frisco’s could follow up with me. Really disappointing.",5
"Even though we had a reservation, we waited over an hour and a half for our family Thanksgiving dinner. It was a mad house, crowded and congested.  Very disappointed.",5
Great experience. Definitely recommend a return to family and friends,5
Working people not really interested in helping or serving.,1
We waited for more than 20 minutes without abolutely no assistance and just decided to leave the place.  No one was even capable to ask why!!!!,1
Will never return!,1
Service wasn't up to standard and host was very rude,2
Service was beyond horrible never have I finished a drink as well as have the bread cleared from the table before the server even came over to take our order. Sever never checked on how things were entrees came as we were still eating apps felts totally rushed!!,3
Lamb was over cooked.. almost rubbery really. Mac & Cheese was tasteless but cheesy. ,5
Waiter didn’t know the products well and tried to wing it. Had no knowledge of the tastes of the wine options. I asked for something sweet but red.. he brought me a Pinot noir that tasted like dirt and i still had to pay for it.,3
Service was alright. Food was great. Too loud to enjoy the experience. A lot was going on. Not a place for everyone.,4
I went here for restaurant week and ended up ordering from the regular menu. I was not crazy about the bacon appetizer but We ordered the ribeye steak for two with some sides for dinner and it was delicious. The entire meal was a bit pricey but I enjoyed my experience at this restaurant. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for a special occasion.,5
"We went for Restaurant week and was made to feel bad that we were ordering off of that menu. The food was good but I am glad I didn't pay full price for some of the items. My steak was overcooked, tell tasty but not done to my liking.",2
Delicious meal great value during restaurant week.,3
"Nice ambiance, awesome music & good service. All around great time 👍🏼",2
We ate at STK before a play and were very satisfied.  They asked about timing and we had plenty of time to get to the theater.,4
"The food was excellent, as was the service.",3
"When we sat down the music was loud, but the manager reduced the volume to a comforable level.",5
It was a good start but awful finish. Server forgot about us and food was a mix of good and mistakes.,4
Service was very slow even though the place was pretty quiet. My branzino was delicious though pricey. Was not impressed.,2
Following a performance of HAMILTON we enjoyed a wonderful dinner with our daughter and her husband. The wait staff was determine that we have an outstanding experience and took the time to consult and recommend courses and wine pairings. Service was timely and permitted us to have casual conversation. The food was properly prepared and tasted wonderful.,5
"This is one of better Italian restaurants in NYC. Given its reputation and ratings it is moderately priced compared to its cohort. The menu offers a number of limited choices, especially on the main courses.",4
This was just a wonderful experience. We went before a Broadway show. The food was gorgeous and delicious and the service outstanding ..... we loved every aspect of it and will be back.,5
"We came here for our 5 year anniversary and it was just perfect.  Every dish we ordered, from crudos to dessert, was excellent!",5
Impeccable service and exquisite food. We will try the tasting menu next time!,4
Went in for our anniversary and absolutely loved the foods! ,5
Every single dish was beautiful and delicious. Especially the pasta! ,5
The only thing was it was not a good place for kids. They do have a high chair and etc yet it is too quiet so we were anxious about our toddler making a noise. Would definitely love to visit again but without kids :),2
"Simply the best Italian restaurant in NYC, outstanding in every way",4
"The waiter burped all over us while he was poring us water. It was the most disgusting thing to ever occur to me at a fine dining establishment. The food was good, but not great. I won't return.",3
"Buena comida,  buen servicio",4
"Local con demasiadas mesas, pequeñas y muy juntas",5
No merece estrella Michelin,5
Local ruidoso,5
The food was excellent. Service was poor. She had an attitude which interfered with the enjoyment. Basically she ignored us once she took the order. I wouldn't recommend it except the food was so good.,5
We come to NYC often and this has always been one of our favorite places,5
Such an amazing dinner experience! Service and food were outstanding. Will definitely be back.,5
"Marea lived up to its reputation and then some.  The food was exceptional, the wine suggestion  perfect with our food, and the service exquisite.  I took a friend to a late lunch for her birthday, noted the special occasion when I made the reservation, and without a reminder (often necessary in other restaurants or it is overlooked), a delicious dessert with a ""Happy Birthday"" message was brought at the end of the meal.  Our waiter was charming, made excellent suggestions, and when it was obvious that the staff was preparing for the evening seating, we apologized and prepared to leave; he was very gracious and continued to make us feel that we were welcome guests.  Lunch was prix fixe and while an expensive lunch, it was well worth the price for the food quality, preparation and overall experience.  My friend is an experienced cook and foodie who teaches cooking classes and caters, and she LOVED Marea.  I can't wait to go back next time I am in NYC.",5
"The food was AMAZING   The bone marrow octopus pasta was great. I went with my father and he loved it as well. The food, service, decor, music, everything was great. So worth the price",5
"Fabulous food. Wonderful, attentive service. For an upscale place, it still has a very relaxed, welcoming vibe. We will absolutely be going back!",5
Excelente como siempre,5
No baja su calidad,5
"Very nice, people are lovely.",4
"Outstanding value! The legends of the Fusili, Polipo and Astice  are all true.",5
"Excellent staff, proud of what they do, and most attentive.  Food - just delectable.  You know quality dining when 3 seconds into a bit, a subtle and delightful new flavor appears.",5
I will return.,5
Went for lunch,3
truly outstanding in every way. very upscale but not arrogant,4
every item was extremely well done. Sommelier  was very helpful. Few restaurants are capable of this food quality and service.,5
"A little expensive, but you get what you pay for!",4
Everything was perfect!!! A perfect night with friends and my girlfriend!! The service was amazing!!!,4
"Unique and memorable pasta dishes, desserts also well executed",4
"Moscow mule served in a glass, would be nicer with  a copper mug for the price.",4
Amazing for lunch. Good price great food,5
Wonderful food. One of the bests restaurants that I knew.,5
"As someone that has had the good fortune to have dined in some of the best restaurants around the world (& that does very few online reviews), I am pleased to report that Marea delivered a wonderful food-centric experience that made this restaurant one of my favorite dining experiences of all time.  Although I was concerned once we arrived & greeted that this might be one of those snooty restaurants that I so dislike, we soon relaxed once we met our server and began our dinner.  Our server was friendly, engaging & provided helpful information about the menu items in which we were interested.  Once the first course arrived my journey to culinary heaven began.  The rest of our courses were similarly outstanding and dessert was excellent.  This is one of the few restaurants that I unequivocally recommend and is on my ""must list"" to return & dine again.",4
Disappointing  experience.Service was not great. Inattentive server.Would not ask if you want pepper or cheese grated on pasta.When asked for pepper the shaker was brought to the table and left on the table.Fast food eatery. In and out in just over an hour.Food was average. and expensive..Was looking forward to dine there because of the great reviews..,5
Pastas was disappointing for two Michelin place.,5
"Nice service, wonderful dry Martini, great food , a restaurant that deserves its reputation.",5
Great food.  Excellent service.  Perfectly run.,5
"The service was slow and the waiter was rude.  The tuna tartare was delicious and the drinks were good but that was about it.  The shrimp my friend ordered was tough and the salad was salty.  Another friend and I ordered the same salad that was either the wrong salad or missing something.  Neither of us ate it and explained why.  Nothing was done with the bill and when we asked for there to be, the waiter couldn't have been ruder.  Needless to say, it was not worth the $300 bill.",5
Dry aged steak was amazing. Cooked to perfection and the sides were cool,5
"I asked for a refill of water twice, watched a waiter working a different station walk right passed us to refill his customers water glasses and finally needed a sip of water so bad that I actually pulled my personal bottle of Poland Spring out of my purse and refilled my glass. I left the bottle on the table as a hint to our waiter. Five minutes later, our waiter came and refilled my husband’s glass. We left a 20% gratuity despite the fundamental lack of service. The pistachio crusted lamb was delicious.",4
"Amazing place decoration, ambience, food, drinks, etc. Everything was wonderful.",5
Food was good but our waiter was too slow.  He took a long time to actually get to us . And one point we had to search for him.,2
Waiter served us our check while we were still eating,3
The food was absolutely delicious. ,2
"The tenderloin was perfectly cooked, as well as the mini-burgers, and the tuna tartar. The desserts could use a little work, I was very unimpressed. ",4
"My only complaint is about the service. They may have been a little understaffed for restaurant week, but that is not going to stop me from coming back here. It's definitely worth a visit!",4
We ran late but they still honored our reservation and took us anyway..we were super grateful for that.It was a Great time!!We came to experience the restaurant week menu ..and the food was Good and the price even better! The dj was amazing..played some top 40 but also some oldies but goodies.The drinks were also made well and strong enough👌🏽,3
Great experience!,4
The server was attentive and the food was very well prepared.  The filet and porterhouse steaks were flavorful and juicy.  The bass was delicately prepared and moist.,5
"They live up to their name. The double filet for two my son and I shared was perfectly cooked, nicely charred on the outside, and full of flavor. My wife's Dover sole was likewise perfectly done and the brown butter with nuts was a nice accompaniment. Where QI stood out though was the service. From the initial greeting, to the server (shout out to Charlie) and the team who kept the water glasses full, they were all as kind, informative and professional as anywhere I've been. We will be back to QI!",5
"Quality Italian and Quality Meats (across the street) are my go-to's for a delish meal EVERY TIME. Worth every penny, definitely more of a splurge for me but it's an absolute delight: order the Chicken Parm, Sausage & Pepper Toast, Ricotta & Toast, Pork Chop, Corn Souffle and their Moscow Mule if you can, you won't regret it! Maybe not all at once ;-)",5
Excellent service and cuisine. Our server took great care of us as we were celebrating an anniversary. The meal was fantastic and the portions were well worth the price.,5
A new favorite and a place I will certainly return to.,5
Great meal near the theater district!  The food was delicious and the service terrific.  It is not a far walk to the theaters and they were very respectful of our time.  The food came out in plenty of time to make our show without feeling rushed or compromising quality.,5
"Great steak options and delicious homemade cocktails. An EXTENSIVE wine list. Seating is a little tight and it's loud, not ideal for conversations with more than one person at a time.",5
Great Food and Great Service.  I normally stick to Fourth Wall Restaurants when I have to have a business meeting because I know everyone will leave impressed!,5
I've always had a great meal every time I go to Quality Italian and my guest have also enjoyed their meal.  Thanks.,5
Estuvo correcto,4
Algunos platos mas ricos que otror,4
"I ordered the cesar salad and a seafood clam pasta. If you like heavy flavor, then you would like it. I personally like lighter flavoring.",5
"I had one of the best dining expieirences of my life at Quality Italian. The food was on another level of elegance and taste. Our server was amazing, helpful, and truly added to the experience. Will be going back soon!",4
"The first thing you notice is the good vibe, very energetic...",2
"The food was really good, the steak gets a little undercook near the bone so note that..",3
Deserts ware complimentary and delicious!,5
"The place was very noisy, not so suitable for romantic birthday dinner.",4
"Overall, loved it!",3
"Overpriced food for the quality. Burger was burnt and charred and cold. Asked for mustard 4 times before receiving it. Have eaten here before and enjoyed it, but the service and food quality has really gone down.",5
The service should have been better and they made mistakes with our order.,4
"Amazing creative menu - dont miss the Octopus and Chicken Parm - everything is delish and fresh and well prepared. Expensive but very big portions, suitable for sharing, and a great dining experience all around.",5
The restaurant was great but wish the noise level was reduced a little so you could hear the people across the table from you.  Not sure about their choice of music in the background.  Music just added to the noise level.,4
"Although the food was very good, the music was WAY TOO LOUD.",5
"Service was truly excellent, and food was delicious.  Thank you for a wonderful business meal!",5
Very loud and crowded but it was Restaurant week ,3
"Great food and service , good wine",5
"Oh wow.....this place was incredible!!!! Huge portions, very high quality for the price, excellent staff, and a beautiful setting.....couldn't have asked for a better night.",3
"Busy place, good energy, get the chicken parm pizza.",4
Amazing!  My clients were very happy with their meals and it was a nice surprise that they had such a great gf gnocchi. Service was excellent.,5
"Great lunch, the grilled octopus was the best I have had. the server Colin was  very helpful with the menu and wine suggestion's  he suggested the sausage and the eggplant aps they were great",5
"Was quite disappointed with the bone-in filet. While the inside was cooked to our requested temperature, the sear was too much. Everybody at our table agreed that the steak had a burnt taste. I have had juicer and more flavorful bone-in filets elsewhere. The rest of the meal was solid but hard to overlook the disapointment with our priciest dish.",5
"The food was very good. Loved the bronzino, spinach and strawberry gelato.",4
Seemed a little overpriced,4
"This is one of my favorite restaurants! great service, atmosphere and food (a little pricey)",5
Unbelievable chicken parm,4
Good quality food with a good selection. Service is quick,5
"Delicious food, chicken Parmesan pizza is a must! Pricey but worth it",3
"Staff was very nice and food came out quickly. Seemed a bit overpriced, but the chicken parm pizza and the lamb cavatelli special had to be tried! Both were delicious! Their extensive wine list is overwhelming but it makes sense for an Italian restaurant to have so many pairing options. For a Friday night, it was as loud as should be expected but the lighting implied the ambiance would be a bit more quiet and romantic.",5
"The food and service were expectacular.  There is no kids menu, they recomended us a steak for our son and we ended paying $50 for a ""kids steak"".",5
"Visited STK for NYC Restaurant Week and the experience was great. My family and I celebrated my brother-in-law birthday. From the food to the service and the atmosphere, we shared a great experience. I would recommend going with or without the restaurant week menu. Will be visiting again to try other dishes. ",2
"ALSO, definitely a great place to celebrate a birthday, especially if it's past 9pm! Music is on point!",5
"The food is excellent, but the service is atrocious. There are plenty of venues nearby where, for the same price, you can get food that is as good or better and you won't have to deal with horrid service. I've been visited by waitstaff more at a Chick-fil-A than I was at this establishment. I will never return to this restaurant.",4
"We made a reservation, arrived on time, and then proceeded to wait for 45 minutes for a table. Our water glasses were empty for nearly the entire meal as the staff took unacceptably long to refill them. We had been seated for more than twenty minutes before we saw a waiter for the first time, and it was another fifteen minutes before bread was brought to the table.",5
"The music was so loud we had to shout at each other to be heard. I understand that there is a bar/lounge adjacent to restaurant seating, but the result of the arrangement is to make the experience akin to dining next to a DJ booth, and as a consequence, wholly unpleasant. The tables are far too close together and thus our already strained voices had to compete with the intolerably annoying diners seated less than one foot away from us. This may have been an aberration from the norm, but the other clientele were pretentious and rude - what I'd expect to find in college at a party hosted by a fraternity of ill repute. ",5
"This dining experience was more than disappointing, it was entirely unpleasant. This was the first and last STK I will visit. If you're considering a chain steakhouse, do yourself a favor and go to the incomparably superior Mortons. Alternatively, try one of the many other steakhouses in midtown that overwhelmingly outperform this establishment. I don't think I'd return here if I was paid to.",5
*Waiter a bit distracted.  ,5
"*Coffee and desert should have arrived at the same time.  *The desert presentation of tossing  cellophane packages of brownies on the table, as if it were an afterthought, was a bit insulting.",3
"Service was great, food itself was a bit disappointing. Had chicken sandwich, all batter and no chicken.  Disappointed.",5
"Great Food. We went on a Thursday evening. The noise level was 1000% There was a DJ spinning dance music! People danced and pranced. It was very very busy, slow service --possibly under staffed for the crowd they had. But the food was great, fresh and present well.",5
"The steaks had too much pepper; for the money it should have been nothing less than perfect. Very disappointed, considering I have eaten there numerous times.",4
"As with other Del Frisco's, a great dining experience!!! The food was incredible, the service was equally as good. I have nothing but good things to say about Del Frisco's!!",5
"Crab cake among the best, wonderful sides, although far too much salt/ pepper on the meat.",4
This is a special dining event when we visit NYC.....always exceeds our expectations.,5
"Overall, the service and food were both excellent. The steak was amazing! My boyfriend and I were celebrating an anniversary and could not have chosen a better place to celebrate!",5
"The prices are steep (even by NY standards) but the food is very, very good.",4
"Food was terrific. We were a group of four adults for pre-theatre dining. We were put in the back room with the families with children. We were ok with that although it would have been nice to be in the front room. We did make this reservation last minute. Our waitress was ok. She had a habit of touching my husband's arm or shoulder each time she visited the table. At one point she asked where HE was from. Maybe she was a touchy-feely kind of gal, maybe she was looking for a bigger tip from my husband? This might be appropriate behavior in a strip club but not in a nice restaurant. We tagged her touching him six times... became the joke of the night. At the end of the night she thanked the gentlemen only...",3
Del Friscos remains one of my favorite steak restaurants. Great food and atmosphere.,4
"Delicious food,good service but alittle slow - over 2hrs for dinner for 2 without dessert and coffee - and the waiter never brought my wine but it was on the bill, he did take it off after I brought it to his attention. I would definately go back, I don't think its a romantic place and it borders on elegant simply because the crowd control/logistics are unorganized my suggestion is to consolidate the bars to the first floor and have 2 of them with bar food style tables and all the formal seating upstairs.",4
Best steak in Manhattan hands down. They also have great desserts.,5
"Pricey. Wine list was extensive. Steaks were cooked perfectly. Too much salt on steaks, onion rings, etc. Overall, a positive experience.",4
The service and food was excellent. Great place for Business and Pleasure. We put Del Frisco’s at the TOP of the list for find dinning in NYC. The price was reasonable. We were NOT rushed as the restaurant became busy. We will go back and bring our friends.,5
Service is always good and food outstanding,5
"We had a fantastic experience at Del Frisco's. A group of friends visiting from the Netherlands, we wanted to have an authentic American first night in New York. And we got just that, and more. The food was fantastic, it was a pity we were quite jet-lagged, so we stuck to main course only (not that I think we could have eaten more in a non-jet-lagged state anyway). We have never had such succulent, soft and well prepared steak, just great. The place itself is quite spectacular too. A huge space, jammed with people, either at their tables enjoying dinner or at the bar(s). The restaurant seems to be mainly frequented by people working in the area, but we didn't feel out of place. Would definitely recommend eating here!",5
One of my favorite spots in New York City. The staff is top knoch and the General Manager Scott Gould is the best of the best!,5
"The place was a madhouse, totally jammed with wall to wall people--difficult to get in because the front was so crowded, unbelieveably noisy all night, even at the table. All in all, an unpleasant experience despite great food and good service.",3
Dependable lunch time and after work steak house.,4
Great place for a business dinner,4
The best steak I have ever had. Great prices too. The service was spectacular. The remembered it was my girlfriends birthday and gave us a complimentary cake. The waitress was attentive and knowledgeable. I will definitely be back. I recommend to all.,5
"One of the top New York Steak houses. High quality, well prepared steaks with excellent appetizers and side dishes. The bone-in filet mignon and onion rings were exceptional. Professional, enthusiastic, efficient service. The setting represents New York City with its energy, excitement and unique character. A great place for that special celebration or just a very satisfying, first rate, New York dining experience.",5
Lived up to expectations. Attentive staff - tuned in to the fact that there was a birthday celebration without being overpowering. Wonderful steaks with perfect sides - not overfancy. Would definitely recommend.,4
"Unimpressed, service wasnt anything to write home about. Our side dishes were forgotten and we had to grab another server to assist. Our half botlle of wine was excellent and for over $60.00 it should have been.I will  Go to Morton's or similar in the future, but not here.",1
"Experience at Del Frisco's was great, it was my birthday and the waiter and waitstaff really made it a special experience. One of the best experiences I've had at a restaurant.",5
"Waiter rushed through menu and specials. Seemed irritated when we asked questions. Steak was fine, although one person at our table needed theirs cooked a little more. It took more than 10 mins to get it back, when it only really needed a few more. Skillet potatoes turned out to be potato chips/crisps with onions. Onions lovely but steak and crisps dont really work for me. Crab cake appetizer was very good. A very expensive meal fir nothing really amazing. But normal for NY prices. Would try do an independent next time.",2
The steaks and lemon cake are ALWAYS fantastic at Del Frisco's. But the best thing in my opinion is the wine list. And the sommelier is great in helping us pick a beautiful wine.,5
Love DelFriscos-Dinner was excellent. Dined here many times. Martini's are the best. Great place to go after a show and sit at the bar upstairs enjoying your pre-dinner cocktails.,5
"I have been to several Del Frisco's around the country. You can't beat the quality of the meat, and occasionally, the fish/seafood dishes are excellent as well. This was my first ""try"" at the NYC location and it was an excellent first experience. The service was exceptional, from the cheerful greeters by the front door, to the waiter, the sommelier, even the bus-boys. The restaurant (which is located on the first two floors of a high rise building) was featuring stone crabs, and they were very good, done and cracked right. The file mignon (ask for the prix-fixe/pre-theater menu, at $49 is hard to beat) was buttery, the brocolli rub and mushrooms done right, and the onion rings to die for. The outstanding wine list will pair just right any m",4
"A special occasion place where you have to make intimacy within the roaring surroundings. With that said, and if you're not looking for a quiet corner in which to slowly and quietly pass the evening, its a lot of fun and great for late night dining as they serve until 12 (but not, we were told, 12:01). Steaks and sides are great. The wine list has more than something for everyone and even some bargains - especially among the French wines believe it or not. Stunning surroundings and if you're lucky, as we were, a great view of 6th Ave at night.It's not a foodie place, really, but it is a very good steak place.",4
"Awesome.  Special cuts of steak - I tried a bone-in filet fr the first time ever.  The wine is fantastic, as always.  This form of luxury is not cheap - but it is worth every penny!",5
"My husband declared the filet steak on the bone to be best he had ever tasted. It has to be said the steak here is amazing. For me though Del Frisco's lacks in all other areas. The sides were only OK, I've had better at Smith and Wollensky. The mushrooms were flavorless (someone give the chef a bottle of soy sauce, that should pep them up a bit) . The service wasn't great. We were half way through our meal before the waiter came to ask if there was anything else we needed. The wine list is impressive, especially the selection of US wines. However, its very pricey, as is the food. Del Friscos will serve you a good steak, but at a price!",3
"First time @ Del Frisco's NYC. Absolutely outstanding. Steaks were perfect; crab cake appetizer is unbelieveably excellent. Extensive fine wine list and importantly, outstanding service, with a perfect pace. I can't say enough!!",5
"Fantastic food and really great service, perfect for our client lunch. Will definitely venture back here again.",5
As usual wonderful! Every time we go to NYC we fit in a visit. They never disappoint!,5
Fantastic meal service outstanding. Is a very noisy atmosphere hard to hear yourself.,4
"We were sat within ten minutes of our reservation. Our table wasn't in a very good location. It was towards the inside of the restaurant. So, there wasn't a very good view, and it was very close to another table with little room between them. I was constantly being bumped by wait staff until we moved the table a few inches back. However, the service and atmosphere were great, and the food was absolutely amazing. As long as you don't get the same table we got I would totally recommend this restaurant!",4
Perfect after work spot - yummy steak and sides - great meal!,3
"We visited DelFrisco's on a tip from a friend.  We were disappointed.  The dining room was so loud that we had to speak over our neighbors just to hear each other.  The appetizers (lump crab and shrimp cocktail) were average at best.  The salmon entree was cooked well but lacked character, and the lamb chops were over cooked and not double cut, as advertised.  We expected more from a NYC steakhouse.  Peter Luger's, here we come...  Pete/Linda",3
The staff was very attentive. The food was excellent.,5
"Great quality food but for that price I would expect more comfortable dining accommodations. We waited about 20 minutes for our table and was told to have a drink at the bar ($30 for 2 people). Our party of 4 people was given a table that was ""shoe horned"" in among many other tables. You could not move your chair back or sit there without hitting the person behind you. The wait staff was nice, but there seemed to be a lack of coordination as about 3 different people were sent for beverage service.",3
"Very loud and very busy, but the food was good.",4
"Really great food, nice crowd for either just a cocktail or a full on dinner. Worth at least a stop in to see for yourself. You will like it.",4
"Food was good, service was solid, wine  list is fantastic.",4
The pricing for the chicken parm pizza was very misleading.  The server should infor the guest that it's actually $68 and not $34.,3
"The wait staff was excellent, the gentlemen that greeted us at the door---not so much!",4
I've dined at Quality Italian many times for business lunches and for personal dinners.,3
"On this recent occasion, the server highly recommended the ""filet on the bone"" which we've never seen on this menu or other menus before.",5
The filet had to be sent back twice as it was not cooked to medium temperature. It was charred on the outside and rare on the inside. I finally recommended that they cut the filet off the bone and cook the meat to medium temperature. They handled it well by saying that they will cook a new filet (i.e. cut off the bone and cook to medium temp) and plate both pieces.,5
nice food and great location,5
It was awesome,5
"The food was delicious. From the traditional brunch fare to the more unique ones. Toad in a Hole (like eggs in a basket but with polenta) was a big favorite. We also loved the french toast and Scallop Crudo. Only feedback is that a couple of items were somewhat salty. The drinks were very good, and it's a very sunny restaurant near central park.",5
"Great restaurant, come here for dinner every time we are in NYC.  Great food, service, etc., never a bad experience yet.",5
Started watching the Sopranos because I'm moving to Jersey and figured its time. This led me to a major craving for chicken parm and this place didn't disappoint. Since I'm apparently forever single I still ordered the parm for two paid for both and have parm for tomorrow aka this is now a cheat weekend instead of just a meal. ,3
"Lets start at the beginning. I was warmly welcomed by the downstairs hostess and led up stairs to be seated. Once seated I ordered my sparkling water and given the bread which was warm and soft. I placed my order the chicken parm, a side of the broccoli rabe and side of the asparagus. Yes for one lay off me I'm starving! The food came out fast and looked incredible. The chicken was cooked perfectly the right amount of sauce and cheese couldn't ask for better. The asparagus was good but the broccoli rabe stole the side show. A few bites into the meal the manager Rich made his way over and introduced him self asked for things were going, jokingly offered to find me an eating companion, and let me know if I needed anything to let him know. My waiter checked in often and my water was never empty. Took half of everything but the rabe home. ",4
Get the Hazelnut s'more. Nuff said. ,4
I'm accepting gf applications. Must want to share food.,2
The Food was Amazing! Start to finish!,5
The Service was Outstanding-A MUST try in NYC❤️,2
"Nice spot, great service. Much heralded chicken parm was a let down. Tomahawk steak just fair. Wine list is impressive. Quality Meats is much better though we had a good time.",3
Our chicken parmesan came in pizza form and was simply to die for - great eatery!!,3
It was wine week --10 wines at lunch! Wow the food was terrific and our clients has a blast,3
There was over a 30 minute wait despite having a reservation.,5
Celebrating birthday,5
Did not live up to the hype. Could have had a better chicken parm at my neighborhood pizza place for one-tenth the price.,1
Sterile and corporate feeling.  Poor waiter service - not attentive at all. Food OK - nothing special.,4
"It was incredibly loud.  We could barely hear the person sitting right next to you.  No way to hear the people across the table.  Service started out good - but waned after drinks were ordered.  We had to wave someone down to take dinner order.  Highly recommended is the chicken parmigiana which is made to fit an entire plate, but very thin.  If you didn't know - you would think it was a pizza from the look and the taste.  They cut it into slices so everyone at the table had a slice - but expensive $68.   It served as the starter for everyone - so perhaps not so bad as everyone ordering $15 appetizers.   Steaks good.  Sides all ala carte - so a very expensive dinner.  The lamb chops were delicious - but fatty.",3
"I liked QI until this visit, which was disappointing mainly because of the interaction with the staff. First, I thought the Steaks come are accompanied by sauce. Even if not, the server didn't ask if we needed anything for the steak (sauce, salt, whatever), and when I wanted to ask for sauce our server was no where to be found and other servers just passed by when I had my hands up trying to make eye contacts with them. I finally got hold of someone and asked for sauce (again, he didn't ask about which kind of sauce or mustard, just said he'll bring sauce). I know the sauce here is usually made fresh as when I visited for lunch, they made it in front of me. As the night was busy I didn't expect the sauce to be made in front of me but neither did I expect the sauce to come after waiting for so long that we just had to go on eating 2/3 of the steak. When I finally got hold of our designated waiter, I asked again for the sauce because we already waited for long after we asked another waiter.  Shortly after another waiter brought the sauce and told our designated waiter about it. As he heard this news he turned to us and clearly told us ""The sauce is on the table"" with assertive tone with eyes wide open that it made it seem like he was telling me that the sauce has been on the table and I should have known. I was furious at what he said and his attitude. He ""apologized"" by saying that he never meant it and that he was just furious at his sub-waiter,  with the tone that was definitely not apologetic. Afterwards he brought complimentary drinks as his apology, but again, his tone was so sarcastic. He told us to chill with the the drinks, as if I was just getting it all wrong for his good intentions. ",5
"I always felt the waiters did not have the best attitude for this kind restaurant, but it definitely went over my limits this time and will seriously reconsider about this place.",5
In retrospect I should have talked to the manager too but didn't want to bother my friends.,5
Food was absolutely amazing and the service was so friendly!!!,5
"Absolute great time, from service to food,  quite superb!  Recommend for Italian good lovers. Truly is quality tasting food.",5
"Slow  receiving good, very salty , not taste well.",1
Ich war zuvor im Quality Meats und die Karte war ähnlich. Essen hat jedem von uns 5 sehr geschmeckt,5
Our third visit. Found drinks at bar too expensive snd not even a nut or pretzel served with drink. Food prices high. Sirloin steak only fair disappointed. Veggies very spicy.,3
We loved the liveliness of the place. The chic parm on s pizza pan was amazing. I would love to go back & try other entrees,4
Loved it! Wanted to try after many visits to Quality Meats and have never been disappointed!,5
Great lunchtime spot for a business meeting. The corn brûlée and Brussels sprouts are delicious!,4
"Excellent service,food and ambiance",4
Best chopped salad I have ever had but will return for the veal filet Marsala.,5
At least good food. Service rude. Order took after 15 minutes we were ready. Waiter never present on the table. Servers maybe overrated compared to the kind of fine dining place. The same money you can spend where people really do a service at the table. Filet and rib steak outstanding.,5
My friend visited from South Korea. Never disappointed. Always have a good time,5
"We were there to celebrate our daughter's 31st birthday. The ambiance was great and the service quite good. The problem was that my daughter's steak was considerably undercooked. The server returned it to the kitchen and it came back slightly more cooked but not what she had ordered. The server was apologetic (although it's the kitchen and not the server's fault) and eventually her dinner was taken off the bill. However, it made for a disappointing experience because we were excited to visit the restaurant after a lengthy internet search. And it was  particularly disappointing because we traveled from California for our daughter's birthday and hoped to enjoy a festive family evening for the first time in 18 months.",3
"Took my GF here for our 3 yr anniversary. When booking the reservation I noted it was our anni & the manager brought over 2 glasses of champagne to celebrate which we appreciated. After that, it was all downhill. The waiter came over & took our drink order, but gave us a dirty look when we got 2 glasses of wine. We each order a steak & he goes ""what? no appetizer?"" disapprovingly. I decided to get the chicken parm pie as our app, not knowing that it was a meal for 2! Now we have 4 ppls' worth of food coming out with the waitstaff making snarky comments like ""lot of food coming huh?"" We get our steak & they spill wine all over me, so I ate a soaking wet steak. Last, the chicken parm pie came out to $58 dollars, when it says $29 on the menu!",1
"Quality Italian is has an open feel with tables that are spaced well without overcrowding.  The service was attentive and accommodating for the schedule we had.  Its location on the corner of 57th and 6th has great views of the street crowd with large window on the second floor. It also has an outdoor/indoor bar on the first floor. The side dishes we had - sunchoke, broccoli rabe and a small order of pasta with artichoke were really good Everyone who ordered fish said it was great however The chicken Alan dish was dry and served with burnt skin. We will definitely return!",5
"Not a lot of places can service larger groups - this place can.  Was concerns when I arrived that it only had a ""B"" rating -- inquired with the waiter why only a ""B"" and really didn't get a reasonably response.  Th table next to us had an older gentleman who kept singing opera.  I thorough enjoyed my food choices but others at the table were a little less enthusiastic.",4
For an Italian restaurant the ribeye steak was one of the best I have had in NY. ,4
We also changed our reservation from two to three at the last minute with no problem. ,4
This restaurant is a find if you are staying at a hotel near by with family and want a treat as,5
There was a mixture of business people and family. ,2
Not inexpensive.,2
Food was fantastic but the room was loud.  Service was good.  Would go again.,3
"Quality Italian is great from the moment that you walk in, until you leave. Their entire staff is outgoing and friendly and the food there is amazing. They have a variety of Italian choices as well as GREAT Steaks... I will definitely go again when I am back in NYC.",4
"Upon entering Quality Italian with very high expectations, we couldn't help but notice a ""B"" rating from the NYC Department of Health. Well that's ironic, given this restaurant's name. We arrived 10 minutes before our reservation time, but weren't seated until 20 minutes after our schedule reservation. There were no apologies for the wait time by the host staff. When the food arrived, there was enough chicken parm to feed eight people, but the side order of rigatoni & meatballs was a tiny bowl with the smallest meatballs I have ever seen. I think the four of us only got one spoonful of rigatoni each. We requested a cup of ice at least four times during our dinner and it was never brought to us. I will not be rushing to come back.",5
"Be prepared to wait. Table not ready even though the reservation was made days in advance. If you like having to wait at the bar, this place is for you. Very touristy. Fun, gimmicky food that sounds good, but isn't really that tasty. You'll have fun, but probably never go back.",5
"I've been to Quality Meats and loved it -- thought this was going to be all Italian, but it's really a steakhouse.  Very noisy, but great food...I had fish and it was delicious, just don't go thinking that you're going to have a Quality all_Italian menu.",5
"As big fans of Quality Meat, we had high expectations. We did not try the steak, as we figured we'd done that at Quality Meat multiple times. We decided to go with the signature chicken parm, and while it is certainly unique, can't say I'm a big fan. Kind of processed chicken smothered with cheese. Wish I could say we enjoyed the Italian appetizers, but highlight was probably the crudo which was delicious. An Italian chopped salad was overly heavy, and the porterhouse stuffed pasta was pretty bland. Kale carbonara was just way too rich. There's just no balance to all the heaviness. I think we'll stick to Quality Meat.",4
"The food, staff (from Jeffrey, the Manager; Kate, our wait staff; Shannon, the receptionist; the bus boys) and the place leave nothing to be desired for a great dining experience. We went for brunch and ordered the shrimp cocktail (big), baby kale salad (healthy) and sausage/pepper garlic toast for appetizers - they were all very good. For entrees we had the seared scallops which were seared to perfection; spicy shrimp pasta which was very delicious and the risotto, also equally delicious. We also tasted the eggplant parm benedict - not a common dish, but great! For dessert we had the gelatos - and they brought back memories of Piazza Navona. Quality food + great, attentive and friendly staff + cool place: what more can a diner ask for?",3
Everything was fantastic start to finish. Waitress gave great recommendations and worked very hard to ensure we had what we wanted. We we never rushed even though we were only two people at a 4 top,5
I have been to this restaurant twice already. Each time it is enjoyable and the food is amazing. I did have amazing service this visit and my waitress was spectacular,5
I have loved Quality Meats for a long time. Was very excited to try dinner at Quality Italian. It didn't disappoint. Everything we ordered was outstanding. The wine list was so large it was overwhelming. The chicken Parm pizza was so creative and delicious! Can't wait to go back!,5
"had to try this restaurant, had heard all about it….the chicken parm is definitely something to get and try…but not as tasty as i had imagined….the noise level is very loud but this hot spot keeps them coming….",4
"Dependable, delicious, vibrant restaurant centrally located in New York City. I highly recommend it.",4
Had a great time and our waiter Anthony was exceptional. He was extremely attentive and always alert for any help we needed.,4
"Our waitress was amazing.  Ambiance was good looking and interesting.  Food was delicious, prompt and efficient.",5
"We were impressed with the excellent Italian dishes, although we would have preferred to have more Italian choices. Since this is a sister restaurant of Quality Meats, we were surprised that most of the dishes ,even at this restaurant, were meat/fish oriented, although the name implies Italian restaurant. I would go here for good food but not with a mindset of going to an Italian restaurant.",5
Menu for lunch was more limited but still a very nice place and nice dining experience ,3
The lamb chops were exceptional. The Chicken Parmagian is easily mistaken for a medium size pizza. The salads and side dishes can all feed a group of four. An enjoyable dinner out. Originally had a 9:00 reservation. Arrived at 8:00 and they were extremely accommodating in  providing us with a table immediately. ,5
Arrived 30 minutes early no problem table ready. Management greeted us and checked on us during meal. Terrific food and fantastic service. Will definitely be back next time in NYC.,1
"This experience was a knockout, a home run, wonderful.  The food was delicious, the wait staff professional, friendly and helpful, and the overall experience was great.  We will be back with our family.",3
"We went at 10 pm.   Two different waiters confused our orders,  I had a great salad.my husbands medium filet was sent back for more fire.  My sirloin bone in was so chewy I could barely cut it. Request for sautéed onions came as sautéed garlic,  my husband loved the muscles.",5
"QI has very quickly become my go to for dinner with friends, hosting guests from out of town, and entertaining clients.  ",4
"The place is built around approachability - the amazing staff takes you through the menu and wines with enthusiasm.  It's comfortable, fun and delicious.",5
Must see New York instant classic.,5
Had high hopes going in and was shocked at how bad the food was.... I'm not usually picky but this stood out as particularly awful.  Service was great  though...,5
Had to pour my own wine twice,5
Steak arrived tepid,5
They were not understaffed nor overtly crowded,5
"We were there for Sunday Brunch before theater.  Based on waiter's recommendtion, we chose the eggplant parm benedict--didn't think the flavor combinations would work, but they did!  Excellent surprise.  Other interesting menu choices as well as burger, steak, etc.  Great gelatos, too!",5
"the menu is limited but the dishes are tasty, I had the corn creme brulee as a side and it was delish",4
"Don't over order but try multiple small dishes for lal to try as you can't miss the"" Quailty well prepared items""",3
Quality Italian exceeded all expectations I could've had. it was the perfect restaurant for my date with my fiancée.,4
"Excellent food...good atmosphere...attentive service...and most important, the best steaks in NYC.",4
Very disappointed with the steak (gristly and overly chewy)--supposedly the restaurants claim to fame.,2
The steak tartar is outstanding. Not only the quality of the meat but also the presentation is good.,4
QM has a very nice winbe list.,4
"Though my reservation was for two, my intended companion was ill and had to cancel that morning. I persevered with a first-time visit to Quality Meats, spurred on by Wine Week's attractive offer, and it was a very pleasant experience. The restaurant was well staffed that day, anticipated and had a very lively crowd, yet my server was attentive and cordial throughout the commotion going on around us. Kudos to all! The cheese platter was all I'd hoped, and the hot rolls and butter a welcome treat. Next time I'll find out about your famous beef....",5
The food was fantastic. Crab and sushi appetizers and Porterhouse for two really stood out. Great wine. Great atmosphere. Higly recommended.,3
"It was a Saturday night dinner. Being a local, I usually make it a point NOT to dine out on Saturdays. However, we were pleasantly surprised at the service. It was loud but not unbearable. Liked the decor/ambience. The food was just okay. Having eaten at many of New York's best steak houses, the steak was not up to par with competitors. The homemade sauce (tableside) is a nice twist but the sauce itself could use some doctoring up. Sweet but too tomato tasting. Much prefer Peter Lugar's sauce! The portobello mushrooms fries were dreadful. No flavor and no salt, at all, on them. The highlight of the meal was the special fish, Dover Sole. I'd go back for this and sauteed spinach!",3
"I went with my girlfriend before heading to a broadway show. So we were early on a Saturday evening (6PM). The ambience is great, there weren't many people dining at that time but it still felt energetic and lively. We shared a salad that we both enjoyed. I had the bone in sirloin that was delicious, succulent and tender. My girlfriend had the salmon, that to her palette was under-cooked. The wine list was terrific - some real cabernet sauvignon gems. I'd go back, and except for the salmon the food was delicious. Service was a little erratic at times, but the waiters were very pleasant. We'd go back definitely. We just wouldn't order the salmon! We liked that it didn't feel like a typical steakhouse - QM is a bit more special than that.",4
"Hello, I have been going to this prototype when it was known back 3 years ago as the Manhattan Ocean Club. The food is constantly satisfactory,...although fish dishes need to be times so that they don't arrive luke warm to the table. I prefer to wait and get a hot plate! Thus, the food is great. As for the wine list, I strongly recommend to reduce your prices. The owner would be amaze if prices went down on bottles, customers would be more apt to invest in one. For example, the Ladera bottle roughly goes anywhere from 60-75 dollars. Depends if you buy at Sherry Lehman or buy it online. Charging 25.00 for a glass I believe is ubsurb! ... Its unkind to the client, especially those who know their wines prices extremely well.",4
Good take on a modern steak house. A solid favourite for early evening working dinners.,4
"Dining experience was good but the wine list, while impressive, was frustrating as tasting notes were the exception, not the rule, the wines were not listed in an order of light body to heavier body, and the sommelier seemed more intent on pointing out his witty cartoons in the middle of the wine book than explaining the wine list.",4
Very nice update on the steakhouse. Nice bar. Porterhouse for 2 was superb. Great wine list. A pleasure.,4
The porterhouse steak was exceptional; it melted in your mouth like butter. The Caesar salad was light on the dressing and on flavor (would not recommend).,5
"This was my second time visiting this restaurant. The first time I visited with some female friends for a bachelorette weekend before seeing a show. Saturday, I brought my husband b/c he loves red meat. We had a wonderful experience. The food and service were excellent. It was a little pricey, but worth the night out, as we have a 7 mo. old son and were spending our first night away from him. We had the scallop appetizer, filet and rib eye for dinner w/ corn creme brulee and asparagus for dinner w/ a bottle of Zinfandel. It was all amazing!",5
"Outstanding steak, wine list, and overall meal/experience. Be prepared to spend a lot, but you shouldn't be going here if you are going to look for the cheapest item on the menu. I highly recommend this restaurant if you are trying to make a good impression on a client, or looking for a romantic evening.",4
The service was very good and the food was great. It was busy but not too crowded.,4
"Very cool place. Top notch service each time I have been in there. I would not say the steaks are the best though (one over cooked, one too rare, and the flavor was fine.) Bring your credit card!!! We had 4 people (drinks, wine, steaks) $810 w/ tip! If you want a better steak go to Delfrisco. That was too much...",5
"It was a fantastic evening and I had a great table - will be back on Tuesday, 3rd March! Yupieh",5
"The food at Quality Meats was amazing. My boyfriend is a real steak lover and he was over the moon about the roasted bone marrow appetizer. As an entree, he ordered the filet mignon and declared it one of his top 5. I'm a vegetarian, so I had the butternut squash soup with gingerbread croutons and the portabella mushroom fries. Both were phenomenal! It's a very noisy restaurant, definitely not the kind of place you would go on a first date but aside from that, it was a great dining experience and I would go back.",5
A consistent and reliable performer. My wife and I go whenever we want to be sure we'll get a good meal with good service.,5
"Great food, great service! We have been several times and will continue to go back!",4
"Very interesting wine list. I found a number of uncommon favorites. The service was friendly and attentive. The steaks were good, not great. Sides were fantastic. Would definitely go back.",4
Overall the food and service were very good.,5
"The best steakhouse experience in NYC. Awesome steaks, great wine list, reasonably priced. Waiter was very helpful and accomodating. Cannot recommend highly enough.",5
delicious food and wonderful service. Perfectly cooked steaks and the side dishes were to die for. do not miss the roasted bone marrow or the corn creme brulee!,2
Food was over priced. I have had better steak at places in NYC for half of the price. Won't return to this place.,2
"Very disappointing. The steak was tough and chewy, the short rib was dry. We won't return.",3
"The food and service were excellent, but we had a reservation weeks in advance for Valentine's Day and they sat us (in a nearly empty restaurant) right beside the kitchen door... Other than the noise, the experience wasn't too bad. The food is delicious and servers are very friendly and attentive.",5
It was a wonderful expenience.  The food was outstanding.  I would go there again in a heartbeat.,4
Wonderful service and cool atmosphere!,4
Will definitely return.,5
"I would argue that the steak might be better at a Wolfgang's but still very good. However, the appetizers and sides were top notch.",4
"This was by far the most beautiful restaurant I have ever been to. I went with my boyfriend for Valentines Day and it was absolutely stunning. The food was also wonderful, everything was cooked perfectly. I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a very romantic place with great food. I must admit it was pricey, but the experience was well worth it.",2
This is my second time for dinner. Food and service were excellent.,4
The crab/avacado apetizer is my favorite.,4
I would recommmend to any one.,5
"I was excited when I got the reservation but was terribly disappointed in the quality of the food. When I compare the service and taste and find it superior at Ruth Chris, the Palm, or Smith & Wolinsky's, that tells me that this restaurant will not last long in NYC.",5
You must get the gnocci as a side with your meal. Awesome!,1
Just another steak place with unspectacular food. Noisy. Liked it better when it was Manhattan Ocean Club,5
REALLY amazing service! Excellent food. My only critical comment is that the prices are very high -- especially for the sides.,5
"Great dining experience. Very pricey, BUT worth it. The food was fantastic, atmosphere is great, decor is really nice etc.",5
"Delicious and very consistent. Had the Hanger steak with brandied cherries--excellent!  Also love the corn creme brûlée. Perfect for a date, business dinner or other occasion where good food is important. Solid wine list.",5
"As they say, this is definitly NOT your Daddy's steakhouse! It was a great meal with excellent service. The scene was lively and the music was great. Was there with parents who are 70 and they LOVED the vibe and the ""UN-stuffiness"" of the place!",4
Everything about the new STK is fantastic. I was already a fan of the downtown hot spot but love the convenience of this new location. Great food and service.,4
"Had a great meal at STK with my boyfriend during our NYC visit. Firstly, the steak really is amazing. I also loved the Mac and Cheese, which was a great side dish. We had been pre warned that the portions were decent so didn't order appetisers. Cocktails were great and the staff were really attentive.",5
The atmosphere in the bar was great - they were playing some proper cheesy music when we went (a Wednesday night) and the place was packed. Great vibe.,4
"excellent prix fix value for lunch, attentive service, excellent prep. birthday cake for dessert is always a smile maker.",3
Too expensive for the amount of food. Steak was great. Trendy spot. Over priced. Will not go back. Sparks is a million times better.,4
"conversation was extremely difficult, as the noise level is so loud",5
"If you are looking for cool ambiance, outstanding food, and top-notch service then this is the place to go - you will not be disappointed!!",3
"Food was very good, but the wine service in particular needs work. Took approximately 30 minutes to be served the bottle of wine we ordered(after 1st bringing up an incorrect bottle).",5
Overall very good experience chic elegant and tasety food,3
Beautiful place but the concierge was horrible and rude. It was my birthday and it took 20 min and multiple requests to be seat even with my reservation. Music was very dated not contemporary at all.,5
"Had a great time here. Food was excellent; highly recommend the parmesan, truffle fries. (Could have made a meal of those.) Agree with other comments on OpenTable; it is a bit pricey but we went for a special occasion and it felt worth it. The green intensity cocktail is outstanding if you like a mix of spicy and sweet.",4
"I was in the city with 2 girlfriends for a girl's trip so we loved the vibe at STK. One bad comment, which I read in other reviews is your wait with a reservation can be very long. In our case we were not seated until one hour and ten minutes after our reservation. We weren't too upset about it, as the music (and it's very very loud) and the bar scene kept us entertained, but if you are on a schedule, this is not your place. Food was outstanding, and I'd come back. It's happening!",5
"Had a great business lunch. The restaurant is airy, high ceilings, and the tables are not on top of each other. Prices are great for the quality of the food. I highly recommend this restauarant for business lunches.",4
Good steak and sides. Wine list is pretty slim.,4
"Been here quite a few times with clients. Excellent decor, pretty good food, good service. Don't be surprised to see celebrities, sports figures or power brokers at the table across from you. Probably a good happy hour scene too.",5
I Love STK And Have Been Here Before Because The Food And Atmosphere Are Great But Both Times The Server Messed Up On Our Order. The Waiter Handled It Great And Was Able To Accommodate Our Group.,2
"My wife and I went early as we had Ranger playoff tickets. We ordered a bone in filet and a regular filet and we had to send the steaks back as the temperature was not correct. Upon returning, the temperature still was not correct and by this time we only had 30 minutes to get to MSG so we didn't get a chance to eat our steaks. The few bites I had were very good but we were disappointed that STK couldn't get our steaks correct after 2 tries.",4
"STK is new to W. 43rd. St. It is an excellent restaurant..wonderfully managed and executed. Its steaks are wonderful and the sauces, vegetables, and desserts are superb. It is very expensive. While the food is great one is paying for the recently built out space in the Grace Building..whose ""backside"" has been recently refurbished. The large terrace area at the buildings rear sports STK's version of Shake Shack...and is just as good if not better. STK is worth the money for a special occasion. Unlike its competitors..tourists have yet to find it. Andy Morse",2
"The food served at lunch was just ok at best. The beef in the STK salad was good, but the rest of the salad was neglected, cabbage was dry and lacking any flavor. The service staff seemed uninterested and not very friendly. It was unfortunate as the restaurant interior is very attractive. Disappointing experience.",4
Great looking after-work or pre-theater place in Midtown. Food is very good and two bars makes waiting for your entire party to arrive tolerable,2
It would be a winner if the food lived up to the surroundings.,5
"Excellent, we will be back. Great food, service and unbelievable ambiance!!!",3
The atmosphere was really cool for this restaurant. I was disappointed however that my steak came out over cooked. You would think that a steak restaurant would be able to cook a filet to medium and not over cook it. Broccolini was delicious as well as the bread that came out before the meal.,5
Had Lunch with friends the place and service was awesome ...,5
"Excellent food! Great service! A must go, especially in the upcoming summer months!",5
"The food was absolutely delicious! The steak had an amazing flavor as well as the side dishes we ordered. Not inexpensive, but worth every bite. The fact that is close to the theater district was a plus as well. I would definitely give this restaurant a try.",4
"Great steak! A little too noisy for business lunch, especially with the mid-town location.",4
Great food and service. Gets loud with the dj but I liked that. If you're in a couple you'll be packed in rather close to other couples. Probably better for groups.,5
"Overall STK was superb. We had the shellfish platter, filet oscar, strip steak, halibut special and the duck. All the food was excellent. Our server and the supporting staff were also very attentive and wonderful.",5
"You can count on STK- great food, drinks and atmosphere!!!!",3
"We went to STK for a post-theater dinner with friends. Apparently we had not done sufficient research prior to making our reservations, as we were totally surprised to find that it's an extremely loud club rather than the dining establishment we'd expected. It was a Tuesday night, about 10 pm, and we never expected to see hundreds of young, heavy partiers hooking up all around our booth. We could not hear our server or each other due to the non-stop, extremely loud music (there is a dj). Again, perfect for a club, but not the restaurant we'd expected. The food was excellent, if overpriced a bit. The wine list is good, and cocktails were creative and well made. I just regret making the dinner reservations for that night.",5
Great food and great atmosphere.,4
"It is nice to have an option to go to in midtown like STK. It can be very loud, but the music they play is great. Wonderful room and great food, but a bit pricey for what it is. Would be nice if you got something on your plate other then a hunk of meat. All sides are extra. Will be great in the summer with the outdoor area.",2
"We had a fantastic eve, with perfectly attentive service and delicious food in beautiful surroundings. Could not ask for more, just perfect!",5
We were in town for Texas and had a fantastic meal!!!,5
I have been going to Quality Meats for a few years and it is my favorite steakhouse in NYC.  I always have a great experience.  Perfect for all occasions.,5
"Been going to Quality Meats for years and as always the food was amazing. They never disappoint with creative cocktails, amazing appetizers and mains. The highlight for me is always the gnocchi with cheese. It's super comfort food.",5
Awesome food.  Awesome service.  Awesome place. Not much else to say.,5
"This was about our 5th or 6th time dining at QM. We always have a wonderful experience. However, tonight was definitely the exception. Our server was extremely unprofessional and disorganized. When asked for something, he replied ""ok, give me a minute.""  Service was extremely slow...especially on a Sunday night without the restaurant being packed. Two hours in we had to ask for the bill to catch a train. Was extremely disappointed in our experience here as it is usually pleasant.",3
"I have heard so many great things about quality meats and I have to say I was a bit disappointed with my experience. In my open table notes I had requested a quiet table as we were celebrating my boyfriends birthday and it was our first time dining there. They sat us in a row of deuces that we're way to close to each other. We were basically rubbing elbows with the table next to us. The service is where I was extra disappointed, for a Sunday night, it took us 2.5 hours to complete our dinner. The server/runner left us for too long in between courses. It took about 45 minutes to get our first course from the moment we sat down. The food was okay. I think that for a $300.00 meal, service should be excellent and the tables should be spread out a bit more. We were a bit uncomfortable from the moment we sat down.",3
Celebrated my girl friend's birthday veré anda the experience did not disappoint,5
"Our servers name was jeffrey.  He was awesome! My son was in town for the day on military leave and he not only brought My son some lovely extra sides but an amazing dessert thanking him for his service!  My son Was exhausted after doing some special training for a few months and all he wanted was a good steak!  He left feeling really good about the sacrifice he is making for our country and couldn't believe how great full everyone was there!  Loved the steak as well!!!  Not cheap but great flavor, taste and presentation!",5
"Celebrating our wedding anniversary at Quality Meats was a superb treat. The Oysters, Steak and Veal Chop cooked to perfection, right through to the dessert were all delicious.  Service was excellent.  Looking forward to dining there again soon.",5
This is our daughters favorite place,4
"Quality meats stands by its name. Steak there is second to none in NYC. Great service, they go out of their way to make your night.",5
We come from a Resort area of excellent restaurants and this restaurant met our highest expectations and more!!!!!,5
Quality meats is delicious and overall a fantastic experience. The food (other than their steaks) is also phenomenal. The meat was of very high quality and prepared very well. Would definitely recommend to anyone.,5
"I love their steak. I suggest that it's for sharing since it is huge. Also, the sides were great and dessert too. But it's too noisy for date night. Service is great too",4
"Very good food, steaks were cooked to the perfect temperature. Service was impeccable.",5
"The ambiance is warm and inviting, yet lively, service is very good and the food is always amazing.  It is and will remain one of our ""go to"" spots.",5
Great service,5
"Realy nice place, very good food and service, but very noisy.",4
"We had to change table as a person sitting on a near table  was drunk, the staff was very helpful.",5
"Excelente lugar, pidan el tocino",5
Quality Meats never disappoints! The service and food are amazing every single visit. This is one of our favorite restaurants!,5
"Fabulous Food, thoroughly enjoyed our meal.  Dominick and Tony were a great team-service was wonderful.  Can't wait to return.",4
"Great service and a great environment. Food was pretty good, but I honestly expected a little bit better from the food in general. The creamed spinach was a little too creamed for my taste, the potato dish we had was a little too bland for my taste, and the filet mignon was 8/10 for my tastes. Again, these are all just personal preferences when it comes to the food. The ""corn brulee"" dish on the other hand was to die for.  The wine selection was vast and had a price range to accommodate anyone. 4.5 / 5 stars!",5
Superb! Congrats on your excellent food & service! I'm going to try your restaurant in Miami and recommend your place to family n friends- exemplary!!!!!!!,3
"Service was AWESOME! Food? I had better at Red Lobster. SMH if it wasn't for our waiter it would have been the worse dinner ever. My wife liked your side dishes though. Should change your name to just ""quality service"" keep the staff lose the steaks.",5
"Our server RYAN and his assistant were great. Made us feel welcome and was very attentive. Great place., food was great.",4
Best steak in the city,1
"We ate at your Miami location and expected the same or better dining experience! To our dismay, the value was substantially higher  in NYC than Miami while the quality of food wasn't as good in NYC. Paid $23 for 2 tiny scallops as an appetizer dish. We were very, very disappointed.  I would not recommend Quality meats NYC. Ocean Prime is where I will recommend clients as well as my staff.",2
"People raved about the bread but to me it was just okay, underbaked a bit actually. Had to send back undercooked steak twice. Waiter was super nice and very apologetic. Seafood bouquet was not very fresh. Bone marrow was boring. Lemon meringue pie fight and burnt marshmallow were mediocre at best.  Good and strong cocktails,  great bacon and top-notch service!",5
Excellent service & food!!!,3
"Very disappointed in this trip to Quality Meats, have been several times in the past where the experience was stunning but not this time. When we arrived (late dinner 9:00) we were seated promptly. The noise level in the restaurant made conversation almost impossible unless you wanted to yell at each other. We ordered several varieties of mead (filet mignon and a New York Strip) and were not impressed with the quality of the meat. The service was outstanding and the desserts were great.",3
"WEVE BEEN HERE BEFORE SO WAS A LITTLE SHOCKED, MATINI'S WERE WARM, AND EVERYTHING WAS JUST ""OK"".  JUST EXPECTED MORE FOR THE HYPE.  TO MANY OTHER GOOD RESTAURANTS IN NYC OR I WOULD SAY I'D TRY AGAIN.",5
Our favorite restaurant in the City. Great for business and personal dining. This is my husbands favorite restaurant for steak. The corn brûlée side is a delicious rich comfort food. Servers are always pleasant and never feel rushed. Extensive wine list with varying price options.,5
"One of the best dining experiences we have had, ever!! Our waiter, Hector was amazing. He made wonderful suggestions, did not rush us through our meal, and made us feel like we were his only table.  Quality Meats, has a lot of great seating and a lot of seats for the masses. We asked for a little spot across from the bar and Hector treated us like VIP's.",1
"The porterhouse for two is only second to  Delmonico's . The shrimp cocktail is huge, and the drinks were perfect. Quality Meats is number one on my list and I will go back soon.",3
The noise was terrible. The temperature was like a fridge. We ordered a porterhouse for two and the seared filet. ,5
The meat arrived at table cold on cold dish. ,5
This was unavcettable. The manager propose us a new one but We should had wait 40 minutes (unbelievable). The secondo alternative was a warm up in few minutes ,5
"Have to say I'm disappointed, I think this place is way overrated. Food was ok, nothing special. We had the mini burgers as a starter and they were not warm enough, the steak was a little tough and the dessert (bithday cake) looked nice but wasn't that good.",4
But the thing thay really annoyed me the most was that we had 3 coursed in only one hour and when we hadn't even finished our dessert they put the bill on the table.,5
Would definitely not go back. If you want to go to a nice and trendy restaurant go to Buddakan instead.,2
It was nice. The food was delicious however there was something about it that just didn't seem worth the expense; can't put my finger on it and thus chose to say go there for a special occassion! Drinks where good.,5
"An amazing start to an evening out with my wife and friends. Food, service, the decor, the scene, all of which were a hit right out of the park. In short, all I can say is ""Just go and enjoy""!",4
great service. my waitess was attentive and the caser salad was super. Great food.,5
Great music but don't plan on hearing each other. Good service,4
"The food at Marea was outstanding. One of the best Italian seafood places we've ever been to. Unfortunately, our table wasn't in an ideal location in the restaurant. It was in the back near the bar. The main dining room looked a lot more inviting and the fact that we were there to celebrate our anniversary made it an even more disappointing experience seating wise. That said, the food more than made up for it. When you reserve, make sure you ask to sit in the main dining area.",4
"STK was top notch. I was expecting great food and it did not disappoint. Service was a little off from what I was expecting. Although not bad, it was pretty slow. Bone in filet was bursting with flavor. No need for salt or pepper. As with most steakhouses in Manhattan, open that safe for some extra cash.",5
It was truly amazing! The haricot vert were outstanding and the steak was beyond tender!,5
"The food is over priced for what it is. Considering what they charge, it is unacceptable to serve ribs that are nothing but fat. Wouldn't dine there again.",2
"The restaurant is sleek. modern, and stylish. The food is overpriced and over hyped. The sirloin steak we had was excellent. The salad was bland, and tasteless. The sorbet was icy. We called the restaurant the day of our dinner to inform them of a birthday in our group. They did nothing to celebrate as we watched candles in desserts all around us.",3
Average food for higher than average prices - not a value. Would not return.,3
Lobster Mac and Cheese was out of this world! Steak looked rare but when I bit into it the center was warm! Everything was exceptional!,4
"Elegant space near theater district, but away from the hustle and traffic jams of Times Square. Perfect location for a special meal.",4
Had a great time and they even through in a free desert sample plate since it was my fiancee's birthday and I told them ahead of time.,4
"Oh my gosh were the chefs at this restaurant serious? The chicken dish was at best average. The dark meat was primarily fat and not edible. The corn pudding tasted like something out of a box, and the shrimp rice crispie appetizer smelled VERY fishy. The spinach salad bland. Need I go on?",3
Loved everything about this restaurant and the staff was great!!,5
"Food, service, wine list ...... Awesome definitely would go back!",5
"Food was excellent. Service person had a bit of an attitude when we didn't order an appetizer and didn't select one of the more expensive wine options available. Sommalier, on the other hand, was quite friendly.",3
Always the best food and service and best DJ's mixing here! Steak Tartar is out of this world as well as the Lobster Mac and Cheese!,5
One of the best tasting steak in NYC. Other items on the menu were good but nothing to write home about.,3
"The truffle sauce that came with the NY strip frites was awesome and the bar offers a unique take on an Arnold Palmer with Gentleman's Jack that will definitely bring me back. I am not one who typically cares for desert wines, but compliments to the sommelier-- the moscato I had was floral and aromatic, which was a refreshing change. All in all a good meal.",4
Nice energy,4
Amazing food minus the truffle fries,4
Ok service- was over charged,4
"Went here for restaurant week and ordered off of the upgraded menu. The Cesar salad with chicken was very good. For the main course I had the loin with string fries, which was excellent. The only thing that could improve was the dessert. I ordered the chocolate mousse and it was very dry. I would probably come back for an after work drink at the bar next time. That seems to be the highlight of this place.",4
But but overpriced even for NYC. $23 for glasses,3
Of chardonnay. Tuna an steak tartare great..bread an dips great.,5
Mushrooms fantastic. Added sauteed crab meat to my steak for $12,4
But it appeared to be just room temperature clumps with no flavor.,2
Steaks good..if your going to spend over 100 a person there,1
are better places..I believe ur paying for the atmosphere,3
Restaurant is completely overrated. Ambiance is excellent. Food was extremly disappointing. I have had better steaks at much more moderately priced restaurants. Would not recommend nor return to the restaurant.,4
Great restaurant we had a fantastic time.,5
Just felt like left not too full. Went with about 6 people. Food was very tasty though.,3
I work in the event industry and pride myself on restaurants and particularly their event space. After site'ing the private space earlier in the year I decided to revisit it for a last minute dinner with potential clients. I was treated so poorly upon checking in since our 4th guest was 10 min late. We were asked to be completed with dinner within 45 min and only after a verbal commitment was he willing to seat us. Oh and he requested we order for the 4th guest running late. Rude!It was embarrassing & humiliating to be treated this way in front of my clients. Needless to say the client has no interest in hosting their event there and I will definitely not recommend it to any other clients in the future.,5
had 1pm res; didn't have the food until after 2pm. not great for a business lunch. we were offered free dessert but no one was interested in that because we are not dessert eaters plus it was too much time. might have been nice if we had been offered some other courtesy,3
The food was not as good as the hype and was way overpriced.,5
After a recommendation tried out STK. Had a fabulous meal and loved the decor and ambience of the restaurant. Service good and there was no pressure or feeling rushed through. Good night - not cheap but worth it.,5
"A well lit place with great architecture, professional service, and delicious food. Popped in for appetizers before a holiday party - the duck pot pie was delicious!",4
The food was amazing.. My only downfall was I chose the dinner special which was the Waygu steak which I found out after the fact was extremely overpriced for a steak that I should have sent back because it was very poorly cooked.,4
"This was one of the greatest bar and dining experiences I've ever had!! The bar scene was fun and energetic. The DJ was incredible!! The food amazing, the wine delicious... I can not say enough good things about how awesome this experience was!!",5
"Preferred to have sat in center of restaurant, more interesting then sitting us in large banquette for 6, we were 4 woman. Looked strange with big table and empty seats.",3
"Went here on a work lunch and it was fantastic! Would definitely come back. Food was outstanding, service was great and with a smile, and did not have any issues at all. Loved it!",5
I found STK by chance as it will be my fiancé's future initials and what a find it was! The atmosphere is electric and the staff make you feel very special. The menu is a true foodies paradise and the triple cooked truffle fries are better than Heston Blumenthal's. The decor is classy and cool. It was a truly awesome night and I would highly recommend! I just hope the London site is as good!,4
"Jay, the waiter that looks like Hugh Grant was fantastic! The place is so cool and hip (so natually I fit right in). Food and service were top notch. Only drawback is the noise level. I had to cup my ears to hear what my date was saying. I loved the tunes but save the higher volume for the after dinner crowd.",2
"Place was great. Have been to STK downtown and was equally as good. It was a little more on the clubish side since they had a DJ but don't know if it was just a Saturday night thing. However, we didn't mind. Food was excellent and service was great.",5
"I've been to two other STK locations and love them all but this was my favorite! Great food, great service, great night out!!!",3
They were out of the first two bottles of wine we attempted to order off wine list. Steak then came before wine. Steak was excellent. Chocolate flourless cake had a piece of paper baked into it.,4
"Best items tried - foie gras french toast, filet with the house steak sauce (spicy), short ribs, hamachi ceviche, brussel sprouts, lobster mac and cheese. Service was excellent. My only regret is that I did not have time for the tasting menu as it looked out of this world. Thanks for a fantastic dinner!",2
Great place to have fun and a good meal.,4
"I went here mostly because the space looked incredible, and I wanted to see it, so I was not disappointed. My only real complaint about this place is the prices. The food was very good, but it just was not worth the price. It was difficult to find a wine under a $100 dollars, which I think is ridiculous. We chose two different bottles of wine in the $75 range and they were out of both. They recommended a $95 bottle as being the next best, and we had to send it back, it was so acidic. Finally we settled on a different grape bottle that was $50, and very good, so not all was lost. The loud music playing was of the late 70’s and 80’s, which I love, but not during a romantic dinner. It seems they are trying to appeal to a bar scene",5
One of the TOP 3 dinners I have EVER HAD!!!,2
"My ears still ring from the deafening music played at 7pm on a Tuesday night. The owner's attempt to make this a female friendly steakhouse will fail when you cant hear the person across from you. That said, the tunes were good as was the meat. Just turn it down several notches. Service below average.",5
"The steak was very good. The drinks were on the weak side. Overall a good experience, and different spin on a steak house.",5
Rude waitress!,5
Expensive but poor quality food.,3
"Great vibe, attractive crowd but very expensive.",4
"great food and staff was all very nice, especially with my guest's limited dietary requirements; STK met them without any problem. bravo to the chef. :)",4
Incredibly overpriced. Not good for a party of 8 as you are crammed into a banquet suitable for 6.,4
"Being from Argentina my expectations on red meat are super high! I have been living in the States for 15 years and I had the best (by far) skirt steak at STK. It was perfect! and the brussel sprouts were superb! If I lived in NYC, STK would definitely see me every month. I would highly, highly recommend this place to anybody that is going to NY.",5
Hot spot. Great food! Good service. Worth the money!! We had a great birthday dinner there.! Highly recommend.,5
My boyfriend took me here for my 23rd birthday.,4
"I fell in love, food, service, music, and enviroment was perfect !",2
Highly recommend,4
"Complicated menu, but staff helps to decipher it. Relaxed and pleasant atmosphere. Imaginative cooking that goes far enough, meaning you still know what you are eating.",4
An outstanding food experience!!,5
We enjoyed our experience at Marea thoroughly. The food and service were absolutely fantastic and the elegant room was a wonderful setting for a special occasion.,4
consistently outstanding ... delicious cooking ... well organized and attentive staff,5
One of this city's best. Ingenious food superbly presented. Utterly worth it.,5
"What a wonderful spot! Lunch was delicious - really elegant and tasty Italian seafood. We had the prix fixe lunch which was quite reasonable considering the meal ($105 for 2, 3 courses with tip, no alcohol). The place is attractive and has great energy. Our server was pleasant and helpful. We will go back for dinner.",4
"Marea offers a beautiful atmoshere, great food, and attentive service. The lunch menu is the bet buy in NYC high end dining.",4
This was by far one of the best dining experiences I have had in a long time. I live in NYC and dine out at high end restaurants in often for work. My expectations are inherently high. Marea is heads and shoulders above it's competition. The food was excellent and the service was flawless. Our server walked us through the entire dinner with just that extra bit of interesting information on history of the chef and origin of the dishes. I can't wait to return.,5
"Food was very good but at almost 40 for 2 courses I would have expected warmer service, amuse, larger crudo portions. JG, EMP, both better food, better service, less expensive.",4
"One of the most amazing restaurants we've visited in Manhattan, and we've been lucky to visit many.",5
"Food was delicious. Menu is pricey. It would be much more appealing if more reasonably priced. Also, service is not commensurate with prices.",4
"Had a warm and salty lentil soup complemented by a juicy medallion of smoked fish, and a delectably seared skate wing paired with a sweet squash-like hash of salsify and a creamy, circular cut of browned oyster mushroom. Warm/oil-crisped, fresh focaccia was served throughout the savory courses. For dessert, the torrone gelato with chocolate cake and a sour cherry compote was delicious-- the light and crunchy almond nougat gelato pairing well with the velvety richness of the cocoa highlight.",4
Delicious! Babbo meets le bernadin. Francesco is the best with wine.,5
You can get a much better meal for 1/3 of the price at any other Italian restaurant in the city. This was one of the most overhyped restaurants I've have experienced in hype-ridden NYC. Don't waste your time. I've had better service at a diner...what are we paying for here?,1
"The food at this Central Park South hot spot was great. We shared a tuna appetizer and then each enjoyed a pasta for dinne. They were unique and full of flavor. The service, however, leaves a lot to be desired. We had a 9:15pm reservation which ran about 20 minutes late. In addition, the service at the table was generic (frienday, but not over the top). I even had to ask for a wine list!!! For a restaurant that charges these prices, I would fully expect the service to match the food. Not sure we will return based on that fact.",4
"Overall, a wonderful place. While the restaurant is beautiful, there is something about it that I didn't like. Maybe our seat? Next time I would not bother with the prix fixe. The dessert wasn't worth it. Next time (if there is) I would get a pasta and maybe split a whole fish...bread and wine selections were good.",4
"This restaurant is expensive, however its worth the visit. Take someone you wouldn't mind spending money on. I dont recommend a groups but the restaurant was everything i expected.",4
"Went here for lunch Restaurant Week. Had the french onion soup (good), the steak frites (small portion but good; fries were excellent), and the sorbet (very good). The place was empty mid-afternoon, looked really nice, and the service was excellent.",5
"i went with my girlfriend for a girls night out. the food was delicious!! it was a saturday night and they had a live DJ there. it was a bit noisy, but the food made up for it.",4
My experience here was amazing. I took my gf here for our anniversary and she loved it. The food was outstanding!!!!!!,4
"We had a group of 6 on a Saturday night. It was not crowded and we sat at a round table that allowed for good conversation. The decor is modern and upscale. The rib-eye steak was good, but I have had better especially considering the high prices.",3
I enjoyed my butterfly sirloin steak . It was so good . The waiter was very kind .,3
"It had a nice vibe, especially as it got a bit later, and the DJ started to find his rhythm , it made us want to get up and start rocking. Overall, should go on ""the"" list.",4
"The restaurant is a great place to hang out with friends or to be a part of the Manhattan social scene. The DJ spins records, the vibe is hot and the food is very good as you would expect from STK. It is not a place to have a business dinner as the noise level at the tables keeps you from having any sort of conversation.",3
"Great prix fixe lunch option - good value and choices - mini ice cream cones (not on prix fixe) are delicious, what's not to love about mini cones with chocolate ganache in the bottom?",4
"a few friends and I had lunch at STK midtown. I had the steak sandwich and one had the burger and another the chicken sandwich. I think everyone was happy with the food but no one was amazed. Not that we expected to be amazed. It was just a good lunch, nothing special. I have gone to some of the local irish pubs and had the same food as lower prices. The decor is pretty cool though. Seems like it would be a good bar scene after work.",5
STK is a great addition to the mid-town restaurant scene. The decor is very cool visually yet very comfortable and the food is amazing. The old school burger with fried green tomatoes is my favorite but the steak sandwich is a close second.,4
"I took my mom here for her birthday and since this is quite a hot spot I expected the food to be just ok, and the service to be slightly snobby. I was pleasantly surprised to find this place has a friendly, knowledgeable staff and delicious food. The decor is beautiful and overall my experience was great.",2
"The food at STK is great-consistent to that of STK Miami. The filet mignon is delicious as is - no sauce or topping necessary. And the special lobster mac & cheese was the best we've had, yet. Full with large chunks of lobster in every bite, this side was yummy. I give Food 4 stars, not 5, bc I prefer STK Miami's dessert.",4
"I give service 2 stars because although quick - it was too quick. The waitress & busboy were ready to take our next order (or plate) before we were ready. During dessert, the busboy took my coffee saucer as I was still drinking my coffee!(I blame the server-she was concerned w/upselling.) I understand the speediness if we were going to a show, but we weren't. We were there to RELAX and enjoy a nice dinner with great foo",3
"I was very disappointed in STK Midtown. The food was adequate, the waitress was very standoffish and two of the items on the menu were not available and as the waitress said ""pretend they are not there."" The service was incredibly fast and not very relaxing. As soon as you put your fork down one of the staff was there to take it away. I felt like they were hovering and the restaurant wasn't even full. I would definitely not go back, given how expensive it is.",5
"The service and ambiance were perfect, food was only okay, a bit too salty and a medium steak is more like rare their. Good drinks though, good music and atmosphere.",2
The food was excellent. The service a little slow and it wasn't even crowded. The restaurant was cold and they wouldn't close the door for some reason. They said it would get colder? Went there for our anniversary. It was expensive (drinks are $17 each. That's on the low end) but since it was a special occasion and the food was delicious I enjoyed it. It's in the theatre district so it's great for before a show. Just be prepared for it to be an expensive evening.,3
This is a lively upscale modern steak house. Definetly well worth visiting.,2
Over an hour to have burger delivered to table from order time.,4
"My friend ordered the lobster salad, they forgot the lobster. My steak salad was fine.",3
"As a foodie who has been all over the world, this was fabulous",5
"from the moment my wife and I walked in the door. Food,service, decor and the view into Cental Park",3
were perfection.,4
"The food was very good but I didn't think the service was excellent ... Also, the place draws a huge business crowd so if you're looking for a romantic night, I wouldn't go there ...",1
very pleasant but the portions are too small for a normal man appetite.,5
perfect for ladies though.,5
"Looked forward to Marea (as I have enjoyed other Michael White places, especially Convivio), but a good experience it was not to be. The prix fixe portions were all out of whack; the crudo portions were a total joke. The service very off-balanced; you really hate to see floor staff congregated around laughing when you are trying to get their attention for over 5 minutes in a half-crowded restaurant.",4
"I say go to Convivio for better White food and experience, or go to Le Bernadin or Esca for better (and more sensible portioning) for high-end seafood.",5
"Fantastic experience -- food was superb, service was excellent but not officious, atmosphere is cosmopolitan and lively, but not noisy.",4
"Definitely the best Italian Seafood (cuisine) you'll have. From service to food, everything was great! cannot wait to be back.",3
"Went for a late dinner on a Saturday night recently, escaping from the DC Snowmageddon. Very good food, good service (especially on a busy night!) and good advice on the wine list (which is massively overpriced for the most part, but there are some well priced options if you look and ask for a little guidance from their sommelier). As is typical with most popular restaurants on a busy Saturday night, the place was noisy. But, as the larger tables started drifting out, it improved significantly.",3
"One nudge to the folks at Marea -- your dining room is too crowded. Free up the space between tables/chairs from others, at least on the main aisles....:-)",4
Wow!,3
"We were more than impressed with many aspects of our Marea experience. We enjoyed that the prix fixe had so many options. It seemed the ideal way to get to know the menu. The wait-staff was impressive and attentive, but not too attentive, if you know what I mean. the somalier was great at teaching us a lot about the wines we experienced. This was a big plus to the meal, which was perfectly prepared- from cruidi to the chocolates as a finish. Great peanut butter chocolates. And thanks for the surprise muffin for breakfast the next morning. We would certainly return and recommend this experience to friends.",4
Unbelievable creative seafood and quite yummy as well; great wine list; service a bit discombobulated with dishes going to the wrong table & a bit of inattention from the waiter; this is a minor complaint as the overall experience is really great.,4
Sardine appetizer too small.,5
"Angolatti pasta & sweet breads, very good.",5
Entree John Dory good but not special.,5
"Entree Black Bass very good, great taste.",4
"Food pricing high, wine list reasonable.",4
Would not rush back.,5
"I thought the experience was enjoyable with a nice environment, good food and good service. However, I don't think the food is worthy of all the raves it has received. The bread selection was excellent!",4
"Food was amazing, but please, $25.00 for a glass of wine? a new personal record, even in NY.",4
"Service started out great and then deteriorated, with a change in server, to inattentive bordering on offensive.",3
"I had the filet mignon - tasteless. The chunk of meat arrived on the plate without so much as a sprig of watercress. No sauce (they passed their ""house"" steak sauce), no veggies, no nothing. It was completely unappetizing. Whatever happened to a restaurant assembling a plate of food that makes you hungry to look at it? I know they want to sell the parmesean fries and grilled asparagus, for an extra $12, but in this economy first and foremost when the plate is deposited in front of you your first thought should be ""Yum"" not ""And?"" I like the more casual vibe than the typical steakhouse, but I've had far better steaks at any number of places.",3
"Well I must say that I myself am a chef, so I find it very difficult to go out dinning wihtout being very ""Picky"" as everyone calls it. I for once can finally say I went out to dine and did not have one complaint! From the time my party walked through the door the service was right on... I asked for a special dessert be prepared for the occasion and my request was met. BRAVO QM....BRAVO. We ordered practically one of everything on the menu and it was delicious! Im in love with the tortellini/mac n cheese! I recommend this restaurant and am looking forward to eating there myself again and again.",4
We were sat at a strip of tables for 2 which was fine.  Unfortunately the restuarant squeezed 4 brokers onto the end table next to us who were clearly entertaining one client.  The situation was absolutely awful - my partner and I couldn't talk to each other and the diners next to  us were very very loud and as they were spending lots of money the waiters were very attentive.  We ate our mains and left before dessert.  A very unsatisfactory experience.  If the table to our left had been used for a table of 2 the experience would have been very different.  I complained to the manager who offered us another date to dine.  Unfortunately we are no longer in NY.,1
I have been to the restaurant a few times but did not like it when at 8:00 pm I was brought to a table right next to the kitchen when there were plenty of other better tables available. I complained and then seated somewhere much better. Then I never received an amuse bouche when the tables around me received theirs. Not impressed this time with the overall service. Sorry. The food though is very good.,4
The food was excellent.,5
But 1 portion is too much to Japanese 2 women.,4
I'm so sorry we couldn't complete asparagus.,4
Maybe half size was enough for us.,4
"The meats are outstanding and prepared to perfection. It is a rarity to find such a quality. I'd rather it to be a neighborhood gem rather than business and tourist place, if you know what I mean, something for the locals to enjoy. A bit noisy, but a very cool deco and great personal service",4
"Service was great, everyone was so welcoming and treated us great! Menu had something for everyone, even the vegitarians were happy.",2
"Dinner was delicious, steak cook to perfection. Service was outstanding.",4
"Pricey but left feeling very satisfied. Only negative I would say is the room we sat in felt like a storage room, off to the side and not part of the overall dining ambiance. It would have been nice if they asked us if we wanted to sit more privately or within the mix.",4
I would definitely recommend to others and go back again with a larger group!,5
"Not a huge fan of red meat, but the Hangar Steak was delicious. Quality meats is onveniently located a block away from Bergdoff Goodman. We had the best waiter ever, he was nice attentive and funny. Nice dim lighting, lounge like atmosphere, not cramped like most NYC area restaurants. A little pricey but not astronomical. The crab cake appetizer was creative but tasty, the broccoli and cheese turnover was served steamy hot, it was very flaky and flavorful. The tiny pieces of bread and the microscopic dressed up halved cherry tomato that started the meal was a little too fancy for my taste, but it was a nice touch. I would definitely go back!",5
"Thought the divided, interesting physical spaces here would provide a more intimate setting than a more cavernous steakhouse - but not so. This place is just plain loud. The smaller spaces reverberated and made it even louder and hard to hear your own table coversation. Don't be afraid of ordering the 24 oz aged rib steak as the weight is all in the 2' bone and the cut is thinner than expected. The beet salad could be more inventive than just a plate of cooked beets. I won't be back. Del Posto is far superior.",5
"Steakhouse without the harsh stuffy (boring) steakhouse ambiance - inside was modern, warm, and had a very New York premium feel without the annoying feeling of uber trendiness one gets at the meatpacking area restaurants. Went on a Tuesday and the restaurant was filled! Made it feel fun and lively. Extensive wine cellar. Food was good. I am not a steak person so my fish was just as good. Service was great - attentive and friendly. Went for my friend's birthday and without even asking they brought out a special dessert for us, without singing & clapping - a real plus! Only improvement was that the my food was not hot - more on the warm side. I think would be really fun restaurant for a date- it the girl eats steak right?",4
"Our entrees took an extremely long time to come out, however prior to us noticing it, the chef sent out extra side dishes. It was an extremely nice gesture and made us ""forgive"" the fact that our entrees took such a long time! The tuna ""le bernadin"", steaks, and corn creme brulee were amazing!",4
"I would say QM is THE best steak house In NYC.Service was excellent,staff was wery friendly five star is not enough...",4
"We loved the decor, and the food was delicious. A great pick for a night out on Broadway- only a ten minute walk to most of the theatres.",4
"While more expensive than I expected, the portions were more than suitable, extremely delicious, and very very well made. They will recommend the Corn Creme Brulee (sp) as a side dish, but the gnochi mac & cheese is amazing and far more delicious!",1
One of the best steaks that I have had in a long time. Bar scene was mostly men and a few cougars which could be a good thing but was very loud at first. You must get a table upstairs to avoid noise. The beef made me forget about anything down below. First impression was that I was going to spend a lot of money and be annoyed by the noise but the steaks out did all. Excellent service,4
"We had a great time here. We went on a Monday night, not knowing what to expect. It was perfect - not too many people so that it was overly crowded and the staff overly busy, but not too few people either. Staff was great - didn't rush us and added in a few extra touches to recognize the special occassion that we were there for. Great ambience, very good food - I would definitely come back. A rare find in this part of town!",5
Great place for a good steak and celeb-spotting,4
"Great ambiance, great food and very good service.",4
We shared the shellfish tower and the hanger steak. It was very good !,4
"Plus, they have homemade ice cream that are delicious ...",4
"Terrible, terrible, terrible! It all started when the $105 dollar bottle of wine we ordered was out of stock. The sommelier rec'd another bottle which cost $118. The wine I ordered was a 92 pt wine that I've had many times. The rec'd wine was an 86 pt wine that was so average. Then there is the food. My rib eye was tough and similar to an Outback Steakhouse ribeye. And the service... we had just put our forks down on our salad when the plates were whisked away by the waiters left hand and our entrees delivered with his right hand! Strike three! How do these places stay in business?",5
Very good- service and food both excellent,4
We simply loved the restaurant! We had a reservation for 8 people and we could not have been more pleased. The service and the food was fantastic. I am certainly coming back!,5
"We found the food to be quite good; both ordered the rib-eye and they were cooked just as ordered and were very flavorful. The sides we chose were the gnocchi and cheese, the crispy potatoes and the cipollini onions which all were a compliment to the meal. The ice cream they make was a great top off to the meal.",5
"A great time! Space is amazing, really stylish and energetic. I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for a proper steak and enjoyable dinner out from beginning to end.",4
Just an amazing restaurant - great service and definitely going back,4
"The double ribeye for two, corn creme brulee, portobello fries, and coffee and donuts ice cream are standouts!!!! Fantastic steakhouse.",4
"went for a celebration dinner for three, was excellent, great service, amazing food, cool interesting decor. expensive, but would certainly go back and recommend.",4
Simply scrumptious! We will be back.,5
"There is a reason why I return to Quality Meats over and over again. It never fails to impress me with its wonderful steaks and impeccable service. My friends and I try to visit a new steak house every other month, and none have lived up to the expectations that Quality Meats meets each time. The room is beautiful, the steaks well prepared to your taste, and the service is friendly and professional.",5
This restaurant is phenomenal! The food is amazing...the service and ambiance were exellent...I will tell everyone I know to go here!,4
Quality Meats were excellent in catering to my food allergies. That is what is most important for me.,4
My first time and suggested by my wife for our 4th anniversary. We had a great time. Food was good to very good; svce was excellent and friendly. We had a very good time and will be back.,5
"The food is very delicious, and the staff is very friendly, upbeat, and can put anyone in a good mood. The restaurant is very open so noise bounces everywhere; it is definitely not a good romantic date spot. The bar is very lively so it's definitely an upscale place to have some cocktails. Although very pricey, I think it's worth trying atleast once.",4
"If I had the money and could eat here every day, I would.",5
The staff made my family & I feel very comfortable while we injoyed our dining experience.The food was great.,5
Fabulous steaks with a great view.,5
I have dined in restaurants around the world and you will not find any better than Del Frisco's! The staff was as excellent as the food. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.,5
Great food. Great service. Not the neighborhood gem we love; but excellent nonetheless. We had a fantastic time!,5
New York steak house at it's finest!!!!,5
Great Steak house... One of the world's best,5
"Arrived promptly at 6 PM for a 6 PM reservation--was seated promptly at 6:45.....after being told by the hostess that it would be a ""1 drink wait"".....dining room was packed---packed with screaming kids---very noisy environment....$42.00 Strip Sirloin ordered medium well was delivered rare to the table---sent back twice---you would think that a steak restaurant that must serve 1000 or more steaks a day could get something as simple as the correct temperature correct.....Fish was served undercooked---mac and cheese overcooked....it was obvious they couldn't handle the crowd that night (a Saturday).....Waitress was excellent and very embarrassed her kitchen couldn't back her up. There are better choices in NYC for the same price level.",2
"Food Great, but served in a bit of a carnival atmosphere. Noisy and jumping, a plus for some a detraction for others.",4
"Bone in Rib Eye is the best in the city. From the front of the house, to the wait staff and the kitchen one word sums it up, exceptional. Steaks were all cooked to perfection as ordered. The wait staff was friendly but not too friendly and did not linger. From high end wines to more reasonable selections were available. Del Friscos has quickly become my favorite place for steak and to entertain family and friends from out of town.",5
"Wonderful setting, service, and food.",5
I've been to pretty much every steakhouse in the city and none of them deliver the level of consistency in both food quality and service that Del Frisco's does.  The steaks are always done to perfection and are the juiciest I've ever had.  The ambience is energetic and the service is impeccable and attentive (without being annoying).  This place is perfect for work lunches and dinner dates.,4
"Everything w==as perfect, but very expensive. There were three in our party and our bill came to 550.00 plus. The service was impeccable. George, the Maitre'd, who came from Bouley is charming, and knows how to manage the room, the staff, and the demanding patrons. The raw plate we ordered for our first course was sublime, and our waiter was attentive and very knowledgeable.",5
"Great food, great service, everyone so helpful. One of our party was on crutches and they seated us in the lowest level. Great time.",5
Food was fabulous; wonderful waiter; great atmosphere! Absolutely loved it.,5
"This is my favorite of the big steakhouses. They're not afraid to season the steak, the crab cake was all grab and service was off the chart.",5
"Excellent service. Very busy - lots of professionals and the bar scene was heavy. Incredibly loud. Crab cake was very good. Onion rings were awesome, super greasy, but very tasty. Steaks were incredibly salty - ruined the meat in my opinion.",3
Food was great! Amazing steak complemented with delicious sides and appetizers. Wine list was extensive with an abundance of powerhouse cabernets perfect for accompanying meat. The place was hopping even on a Tuesday evening - a little noisy for a business dinner. Staff was attentive but not intrusive.,4
"Great location, convenient to Times Square hotels. It was an excellent venue for a business dinner. Even though crowded, we were seated within 5 minutes of our Open Table reservation time.",4
"Had a very enjoyable evening. The staff was friendly and professional, and our waitress provided excellent details about the menu selection.",5
Ambiance non existent. You feel like your dining in a bank. Service is pretentious. Server was forgetful on a number of times. We would never go back.,1
Awesome crab cake....Best I have ever had. Steak slightly overcooked. Excellent Service! 100% would go back. Leave room for an amazing slice of caramel cheesecake!,4
"Beautiful bar, resv was for 7:45 got seated at 8:15. We were seated in the Wine Cellar. Thought that would be really cool. Wrong! It was fine until you realize you are seated in a very nice basement. The noise was so bad we were yelling across the table and no one even realized how loud we were talking. Meal was good. I had the regular Ribeye I can't see the benefit of spending an extra $25 for adding 2 ounces of meat and a bone. Ruth's Chris Bone in is $5 more.",4
"Mac and Cheese, do not order way overpriced and average at best. Bill was $650 with 2 bottles of $70 wine, and 4 cocktails and no desserts.",2
"Del Frisco’s is one of NYC’s finest restaurants for beef and seafood.  A bit pricey, but not unusual for NYC.  My wife and I were visiting from Pittsburgh and it was my birthday.  We split a 16 oz lobster tail, an 8 oz filet, and the baked califlower with Brie cheese (an don’t miss the crab cake for an appetizer!).  It was perhaps the best meal we ever had in the city and we visit often!  And the service... one word... exceptional with superb table-side conversation.  Our server (Kendall) and manager (Kat) provided the extras that sets this place apart.  If you’re visiting... this is a must and we’ll always visit when visiting NYC!  PS... ask for a seating upstairs for a really nice view!",5
"Always excellent food served by a friendly, professional staff. Love the diversity of choices on the menu.",5
All around perfect.,2
"Note: One in our party arrived Jet-lag and was very grouchy and hungry. We were told that it would be at least 15-20 mins before we were seated but when he learned our friend was not pleased, he immediately tried to comfort us and we were seated within five minutes.",5
"ok, perfect night",5
"Sorry, overall not a good experience. The food was excellent,let me say that first but: 1)The first encounter with the reservation staff was horrible. I was ignored immediately when I was recognized as not a ""regular"" Our Open Table reservation was ignored until I complained four times. Finally, 45 minutes later upon the threat of leaving he 'gave"" me a table. 2)the service was condescending. The waiter asked me if we had been there before and when I said no he responded ""oh my. Wow"".3)The pacing was terrible. We waited 45 minutes between courses. We finished dinner at 11:30pm and were the next to last ones out of the restauarant.So for the priveldge of paying ridiculous prices we were treated so poorly. Need less to say we will not be back",4
Wonderful food. very nice service. i will be back,4
Pastas can be ordered half portioned AND split for two - 1/4 portions. =),5
"The food was wonderful, truly excellent. The service was professional but a little rushed and...not exactly unfriendly, but not exactly friendly either—more concerned with just getting the job done than with really making us comfortable. Although we had a reservation, we waited over half an hour for a table, during which we stood in the lobby--bar too crowded to sit there, a lot of people seemed to be having to wait--and no one even offered to check our coats. On my salary, it is definitely a special-occasion restaurant, but there are special-occasion restaurants where I feel comfortable and at home; Marea seemed a little corporate and glitzy. But the food is sophisticated, original, and delicious, and I would definitely go back.",4
Unfortunately arriving on time is problematic if your table is not yet ready. The bar was totally filled with people eating dinner. There was no place to have a drink or relax while waiting. The wait wasn't too bad though. The food was terrific but the waiter not nearly as attentive or helpful as the sommelier. The prix fixed menu is the best way to experience their food. Nevertheless the next time we want a great seafood experience that costs over $300 we'll go to Le Bernardin and enjoy their superior space and service as well as their superior food.,5
"One of the most amazing dining experiences that I have had in the United States. I am almost speechless. We started with a wonderful bottle of Ribolla and decided to go with the four course prix fix. I started with the Polipo, an octopus dish, which goes to show what mastery is involved with simple preparations of outstanding quality ingredients. On our waiter's recommendation I had the house made fusilli with red wine braised octopus and bone marrow. Octopus and cuttlefish are some of my favorite seafoods but hard to find well prepared and not overcooked. The Seppia, cuttlefish, that I had as my entree was one of the most perfectly prepared seafood dishes I have ever had. Plotting ways to get back to NYC for more Marea!",5
"The menu is very good with a number of delicious homemade pastas. Seafood is king as it should be. The wine list is fairly extensive with excellent choice by region and price. The food itself was good but it was obvious that with the prix fixe option, things had been re-heated and/or left out under a heat lamp. Also, there was little to no time between courses. Turning tables at this caliber restaurant/prices is unacceptable. If we go back, we will definitely order a la carte. The servers were helpful without being overly solicitous.",5
"A terrific dining experience, couldn't have asked for more despite all the expectations based on the reviews.",3
"We don't normally frequent one star restaurants before the theatre, but there was a table available at 6PM and a friend really recommended this place. What a wonderful recommendation. It was truly an excellent dining experience. The salt cod to begin was light and luscious - the sea food risotto a wonderful rich combination of flavors. Service was impeccable and the wine list contained an interesting and varied selection by the glass. We were never rushed and had no problem making the 8 PM curtain.",4
Overall tough to beat.  Super menu had lunch there and it was a very pleasant experience.,5
All categories are a ten except the noise level.,5
The food was great but the service was not good. Had to flag over a bus boy to get a waiter to come by. There were many bus boys but not enough waiter. I think we were sitting in a dead zone.....,4
"always a pleasure, great menu, wonderful service",3
loved it! best oysters in town! everything excellent; a must!,4
"Excellent dining experience and a very pleasant environment. The view to Central Park was definitely a plus, it gave a great sense of openness. We will definitely be coming back.",5
Excellent food and great service and surroundings.,2
We had a party of 5 for dinner at 730. Our entire party agreed the steak was not up to the quality we expected. It was the quality of the meat rather than the prepartion.,5
"Everything was excellent, with a large group we order almost everything on the menu. Not one item was disappointing, everything was wonderful. This was our third time eating at Del Frisco’s in a month. The lever of consistency from service, through food preparation and taste was amazing.",2
"We usually go to our favorite steakhouse, Keens, when we are in the city. However, we were tired of perfection so we decided to try a new steak place. We were expecting a wonderful dining experience. However, that was far from the case. The poor experience started with the seating. We passed at least 50 comfortable-looking booths which had a beautiful city view and were seated in a back room by a service station with waiters and waitresses passing back and forth constantly. I am led to believe that this was due to the fact that we went with my 13 year old son, as it seemed we were seated with other children. Now to the food. All of our food came out INEDIBLE (over seasoned). We believe this was because we were not regulars. Just go to KEENS",4
"Experience was overall great. However, I had requested they bring out a surprise dessert for my boyfriend's birthday. When we were seated at our table they had left the note with the special request right there. First thing my boyfriend did was pick up the note and read about his suprise! Also, it took a very long time to just get water on the table. Somelier was not of much assistance either. Despite these things, would go again as food was exceptional.",5
Our experience was great. The waitress was very knowledgeable and friendly. The filet mignon was amazing.,5
Best steak and side dish menu in the space. We consistently eat here on every trip to NYC.,4
"We often dine at Del Frisco's Fort Worth, and the difference was notable. Not that it was bad, just notably different. Our steaks came but our sides were delayed. Our server, however was good.",5
Excellent evening from service to food!,5
"This was the best meal I've ever had. EVER. I was looking for a great steakhouse and Del Friscos didn't have any of the top reviews, however, I worked a Sullivan's for 4 years and decided to come here. SO happy and still talking about it 4 days later.",4
the steak was surprisingly grizzly although the flavor was outstanding,4
"Food was amazing as usual...however they sat a table next to us and there were to many people for the table so they crowded us in...not cool when you drop $1,000 for 4 people and we only drank 2 bottles of wine...",5
"The food was excellent, both in presentation and flavor. Our server was both very friendly and professional and made some very helpful suggestions. The view of Manhattan through the huge windows was breathtaking and made the occasion very special.",4
It was packed on a Wednesday night. Had to wait 30 minutes for our reservation to be ready. But got a table in a quiet back room and service was excellent so no complaints.,5
Outstanding as always. Service was impeccable and the Sommelier did an outstanding job when dealing with a table full of experienced wine lovers.,5
Great food every time I visit. Look forward to my next trip. Lunch was great...must have the bone in fillet for dinner.,4
"Best steak I've ever had!! Service could use some work though - my salad was soaked in dressing despite having asked for it on the side, we repeatedly had to ask for water and finally got it in the middle of the meal, and then the server was nowhere to be found when we needed the check. But we weren't in a hurry and the amazing food made up for it.",5
Absolutely amazing!!!,5
"This place is to die for. Ashley nailed it with excellent overall service, warm presence and a great table manner. The Potato au Gratin is a MUST!",5
A touch on the pricey side but every bite is worth it!  The steaks and the sauce combos are perfect. The sides are large.  We took home enough food for an additional full dinner!  The service is impeccable.  The space large and beautifully done.  Treat yourself!,5
Beat steak I’ve had in a long time and stone crabs were delicious!,5
"Everything about the place was great. From the moment i set foot into the spot I knew i would like the place. Food was amazing, drinks were on point! The service was awesome as well. Overall I had a good experience, especially when it was for a special last minute occasion for my wifey's birthday, had a great time. Definitely would recommend to a friend or family.",5
Great dinner service was awesome. Our server was great. Extensive wine list. Great Choices.,5
"Party of 5, service was prompt and the salmon and scallop seafood dishes were delicious. Do not skip out on the cream corn.",5
"Exceptional food but portions are generous so we could have shared. Have the steak trio - omg- out of this world!! Excellent restaurant, great food and service. I highly recommend.",5
"Amazing restaurant. We were late for our reservation but they held the table for us on such a busy night, we were so grateful.  Food was 10/10 and our server's positive attitude really made our night. The whole staff really made sure our dining experience was to be remembered.",5
As always Marea delivers.  Great staff and attentive service.  Thanks again for another great meal,5
Excelent👍👏,5
Wonderful food - excellent service.,5
"The food was delicious and service was excellent. Got to lunch half hour earlier than our reservation, but they sat us right away on a busy Friday. We ordered the lobster and grilled octopus to start and then 2 fuscilli pastas with grilled octopus and bone marrow. Everything was flavorful, cooked perfectly and the service time was on point. Several waiters checked on us frequently and refilled our water and asked if we wanted more bread. Our main waiter was also attentive and checked on us at the appropriate times. We had no room for dessert, but the waiter brought out complimentary petite fours- I think it was an apricot and honey tart and the other a blueberry square. Those little bites were a great way to finish off our meal. The lunch prices were what I expected of a nice restaurant in NYC and well worth it. We walked out full and satisfied. I'd love to dine here again.",5
One of best meals we have had.,5
"We opted for the 5 course tasting. The food was excellent.  Particularly the sashimi, three small pieces of fish with delicate flavour enhancements. A great buratta and lobster dish. Crabmeat pasta...",5
Fabulous~!,5
"Marea is our fav restaurant in the planet. Great service , elegant yet buzzing atmosphere, fantastic staff. Love the crudo, pasta, branzino!",5
"We are traveling from Brazil and I heard that this restaurant was really good, and of course it worth!",5
I recommend!!!,4
"The food is very well prepared, most people won't be disappointed. Our first server was a bit of arrogant, never saw him coming back after take order, but the other waiter helped afterwards was very pleasant and helpful. Service is a very importsnt part to make a nice evening, I wish the restaurant can evaluate that too.",5
"The food at Marea is impeccable and for as many times as we've been there, we are impressed every time with how delicious it is. I'm always fascinated by not only the taste of the food but how they coordinate the perfect texture for every bite. John, our waiter was phenomenal. We truly appreciate his service and how accommodating he was to us.",5
An exceptional restaurant.   Food is top quality.  Menu is varied and ordering options are very flexible to let you design the size and type of meal you like.,1
"Horrible.  As far as dining experience is concerned, Marea failed all but the food itself.   Marea has plenty of servers but offers no service. Overpriced restaurants cannot stand on food alone.   Plenty of NYC restaurants  that would give you a good experience but Marea will not.",5
The fusilli with octopus and bone marrow are one of the best pasta dishes I have ever had (and I lived in Italy for a time),5
"Awesome service, dining room, etc.",5
An absolutely MUST in NYC,5
Simplemente delicioso y muy buen servicio y hermoso el lugar!!,5
Everything was absolutely stunning! Food just superb!,5
"Excellent service, delicious food. Lovely atmosphere. I wish they had a similar restaurant in England.",5
Truly worthy of its 2 Michelin stars,4
Fusilli with red wine braised octopus was incredible,5
"August 2017. Birthday  celebration. Lovely atmosphere, excellent service and delicious meal.",5
"Sadly, our salad was not fresh. Our plates of food were messy and sloppy, not what one would expect of a restaurant of this caliber.  Our waiter basically ignored us until there was an issue and was very arrogant. We have eaten at other 3 star Michelin restaurants, Marea was very disappointing. Very haughty and well, snotty. Not a great environment. They focus too much on ""locals"" and ignore other paying customers.",5
Amazing food & service.  Puts Le Bernadin to shame.  Michael White  and company have their act together.  Solid performance all around.  Made our 25th Anniversary an exceptionally memorable occassion! THANK YOU !,5
"Amazing lunch, it was great value! I expected to pay a lot more for a Michelan restaurant",4
"What a wonderful place to celebrate a special occasion. We went to celebrate both of our birthdays, and we were treated with such grace,  and made to feel so special. Michael White's restaurants are wonderful. The food was outstanding, especially loved the pasta with crab. The wine choices were perfect. Every time we go to Marea, we look forward to our next visit after that.",5
The quality of the pasta and seafood is top notch! They did not miss a beat! The service is also very good.,5
"On Monday, August 21, 2017, my wife and I had dinner there.  It was for her birthday.  It was our second time there. Our first time was in July, 2017 on my birthday. We had an excellent experience during the first time. I asked my wife where she wanted go to. She chose Marea. We arrived early for our reservation at 6:00pm. The woman at the reception desk invited us to sit at the bar. We do not drink alcohol. The dining room was empty. We had to stand in the lobby. After about ten minutes, my wife needed a chair. I saw a chair next to the cloakroom. My wife sat on that chair. After we were seated in the dining room, our servicer disappeared. I had to find him. We asked him about nonalcoholic drinks. We had the prix fixe menu. For appetizers, my wife had the grilled octopus and I had the lobster, which were delicious. For the pasta, we both had the gulf shrimps. For our main course, we had Branzino for two persons, which was excellent. There were four sauces with that fish. Our servicer did not ask us about the side dishes.  On our first time there, our servicer asked us about the side dishes. A waiter brought us a big bowl of arugula, which I can not eat due to my medical condition. That came as a big surprise to us. The mushrooms were dry and were like leftover scraps. We had the mushrooms in July. After we explained the medical issue concerning the arugula, the server brought us a side dish of fingerling potatoes to replace the arugula. The manager came to our table asked us what wrong with our dinner. The service was poor. For our desserts, we had the strawberry meringue. My wife got a candle with her dessert for her birthday. To compensate us, we got an extra dessert and they did not charge us for our nonalcoholic drinks. We ate half of the fish and took home. The next night, we discovered they forgot the sauces. That was very disappointing because the fish did not taste as good without the sauces.  Overall, Marea is not reliable.",1
Amazing food and service. Didn't expect anything less,5
I would highly recommend the squid. It was delicious and would recommend this restaurant. The service is impeccable and the food was delicious.,5
Both highly overrated and overpriced. Service was formal enough to feel condisending.  Signature dish of bone marrow fussili was not good.  Octopus was overdone.  Wow what a disappointment.,5
"Caviar, oysters in a cool setting. Doesn't get better than that",4
Octopus fusili was ammazing!!,5
"The food was incredible. We had a lot of plates, and the ones I would say cant be missed are the fusili pasta and the astice antipasti. This place was amazing!!",5
"Everything was good from the reception to the food, the service is kind and efficient and the ambience is fine too.",5
"You can't go wrong with Marea - top notch food and service. It is expensive, but if you have something to celebrate or someone to impress, this is the place.",5
"simply wonderful as always!  I've always enjoyed Marea, having been there with friends and family and with business associates!",5
I moved away a year and a half ago and this is what I missed most about NY... great food and impeccable service... still impressive and still a must when I visit; and a reason to hurry back!,5
"I had a much better experience at Convivio (same owners) and will not be returning to Marea, which is overhyped. It's never a good sign for a restaurant when the ""scene"" is mentioned more frequently than the cuisine. That said, the Lobster with Burrata was indeed excellent.",5
"The freshest oysters, delicious pasta and the best dover sole I've had this side of the Atlantic.",3
Wow...already looking forward to returning,2
"After reading stellar reviews from the New York Times and previous diners our party was very excited to dine here on a Saturday evening for a birthday. Upon Arriving, we had to wait by the bar for about 20 minutes after our reserved time. Once we were seated the waiter explained the menu and the tasting menu options. He made some suggestions and we ordered some of those. The first thing we had was the ricci - no one in the party liked it and no one finished it. No one asked how the food was when they cleared our first course. We were still hopeful our next courses would be better - unfortunately they were not. I had the uovo which was somehow bland and the egg was undercooked. Everyone else didn't enjoy the food, it was flat.",4
We had an unbelievabe dining experience at Marea's.,5
I would recommend this restaurant above the many more famous restaurants in the city. Just go and be amazed.,4
"Dined there on Saturday night and fell in love with the food but felt rushed throughout and probably will not return. After every course plates were cleared before everyone at the table had finished. Entrees were actually delivered before the last diner had finished her pasta course. Sad that generally great food was overshadowed by such poor pacing. It also seemed that the room had somehow been forced-fit an additional table - between the rushed dinner and overcrowding, is the restaurant trying to eek out the last dime?",4
"Way too thrilled with itself. Wait staff was just awful as soon as they had more than two tables to service. Items were forgotten, no apologies made, never offered bread during the meal, wine was never poured after first glass, water was not refreshed. Waiter was snobby but unknowledgeable and could not adequately describe the food. Food itself was hit or miss. In all, not a great value--many better options in NYC.",5
Great cuisine and excellent value.,4
"our lunch was divine. the food is refined, focused and what soulful pasta....from a chef, to a chef and staff...YUMMMM! thank you.",5
"Super people watching, certainly 'seafood lover' dining, delicious!",5
"Although the food was enjoyable, the ingredients and the portions do not justify the high price. The prix-fixe lunch for $38 was high since it did not include the dessert and the portions were appetizer-size.",3
"In a word WOW. Food was out of this world. The combination of flavors of every dish we had was amazing. Great space and outstanding service. Absolutely deserves the Michelin star it was awarded. We have eaten at Alto, also a WOW, and will definitely be trying Convivio some time soon.",5
"The oysters were terrific because not only were they fresh, they were the right temperature, very cold!",5
The crudo menu is also unique and tasty.,5
The lobster ravioli was delicate and amazing. the bone marrow pasta was not as impressive as what the NYTimes made it out to be.,4
Desserts were underwhelming.,5
"But overall, very good!",4
A classic New York dining experience.,4
"Rather than exchange presents this holiday season, my siblings and I decided to start a new tradition of sharing a very good meal, just us. We couldn't have kicked off this new ritual at a better place than Marea. The food met our very high expectations, and the prix fix suited us perfectly. Apart from bread service lagging once or twice, the service was impeccable. We were careful not to duplicate dishes on the table and we all commented that a restaurant that serves almost exclusively seafood had so many options, yet flavors somehow hardly overlapped. My sister was torn between two desserts and both magically appeared before her, compliments of the house. We said our new custom would be a very good meal but it may become dinner at Marea!",4
Been there many times. This is the one time this place was off,4
Perfect !!,5
"We waited 70 minutes for our salads and appetizers to come out, and had to order the same glass of wine 4 times before it came out.  They totally forgot one desert, and no one ever checked to see if we needed anything.",2
"One person in or party needed an elevator to go up the 3 sets of steps to our table, but alas, even tough the restaurant is on 4 levels, there is no help for those who can't climb stairs.",5
"And all through it, our server made us feel like he was doing us a favor to bring the late food.",5
Definitely would never recommend to anyone!,5
Amazing. Fantastic food and atmosphere,5
What a fabulous way to spend my birthday!,5
The atmosphere is energetic.  The design of the interior is unique and lends itself for areas to feel intimate.,2
The porterhouse is outstanding!,5
"Fabulous dinner at Quality Meats for my daughter’s birthday. The food, service and ambiance were fantastic. The sticky toffee pudding and fig ice cream might be the best thing I’ve ever eaten. I cannot recommend this restaurant enough.",3
Everything was excellent except the waiter was older and had no personality,5
"The hostess can use some customer service training. But other than that, Great service form servers and great food!",5
Had a booking but still made us wait for 30mins with poor attitude. Don't bother running a restaurant if you don't know a thing about service,2
"Came to eat at Del Friscos with my Parents on a Saturday night before seeing the Christmas Show at Radio City. Our waiter Kenny was awesome, very attentive, and welcoming. We took his recommendations on the house drink - VIP, the Filet Trio and the Lobster Mac and Cheese. All three were great choices. Great for a special occasion dinner.",5
"What can I say that hasn't been said already?  Bar none, best steakhouse in NYC.",5
"Some of our party got stuck in traffic and were running a little bit late but the restaurant was very accommodating and let us push our reservation back slightly which we greatly appreciated given we were there to celebrate a 60th birthday. Our server, Thomas, was great, and was very mindful of time considerations. Everything we tried was amazing, from the appetizers, to the steak, to the side dishes, we could not have been happier with the food.",5
"Our experience was lovely from beginning to end. Our server (Tara D) was phenomenal. She's extremely knowledgeable and we trusted her recommendation of appetizers, wine, steak and dessert. I highly recommend it!",5
Had the bone-in Ribeye and bone -in filet... Outstanding!,5
"Food and service was outstanding, I’m definitely going back when i visit New York again!",5
Would have gotten 5 stars but bar service was extremely slow even though we ordered from our waitress at dinner table,4
Great food.  Made a reservation for 8 people and they put us at an extremely small table.  It was tight which took away from the experience a bit.  Food was amazing.,4
"Great dry aged steak. Marble, juicy, melt in your mouth and perfect temperature. The server very informative and friendly. Great ambience. Great selection of wine. Great job!",5
We had play tickets and only had one hour. Felix & team made every accommodating effort to get us out to show in under 45 minutes. ,5
They are the best. Food is amazing!!!,5
First off all food is amazing. Totally worth the price. I took my bf for his birthday and he loved it. Bone in Prime Ribeye was so delicious . Definitely try lobster mashed potatoes and  thick cut bacon! So good! Highly recommending this place. Service was lovely and very helpful:),5
Superb service.Great ambiance and excellent food choices,5
Great food and service. Our new favorite in Manhattan.,5
Maritza was amazing!!!!,5
I ordered 23 oz porter house and my guest ordered 45 day aged Ribeye both were very good,5
Place was packed with so many people not for muddy date but good for business dinner,5
"Even though I'm not crazy about the old-fashioned Midtown spots, the steaks here are undeniable good and the service was great. Our waiter tried to upset us a few times, but in a polite and friendly way so it was acceptable. The truffle butter was a GAME CHANGER on the steaks, the 12 ounce fillet was surprisingly so tender and juicy. Lemon cake was good but nothing to write home about. Overall, a great experience and although it can be costly, totally worth the money.",4
"We had James as our waiter who was very attentive. We had the special steak filets with different sauces and the bone in filet mignons were delicious,  great choice of wines, seafood platter and the foie Gras appetizers  . I was also there the Saturday before for dinner and the meal was also delicious but insanely packed. It's definitely a place you need a reservation for.",5
"Reservation highly recommended as they stay busy during the week until late. We were seated on the second floor, with nice views of the ground floor activity. Menu slightly changed, had more offerings, but we stuck to our traditional salad, porterhouse, and one side dish order. The steak, as usual, was amazing. However it did seem smaller sized than at previous occasions. The Asparagus was prepared in a new sauce, and was perfect side to the steak. The Cobb salad was exactly as we expected - also delicious. Service was a bit subpar, as I had to request a setting of silverware, and had to ask other waitstaff for wine refills and our check. Otherwise a very nice meal in a very nice place.",4
"was late for my reservation but i still got sited in a good time . the place is beautiful nice views and pictures, good music great setting i loved it was  my first time there and won't be my last Big Thumbs Up",1
"Waitress was outstanding. the place is loud, over crowded and expensive. But still a really good place to go with its energy and good food.",5
I would recommend this restaurant to anyone with a hefty and unmonitored  business account.,5
"The prices are phenomenal--and ridiculous: around $50 for a few slices of barely cooked fish arranged on a plate, with little seasoning no accompaniment.  Who needs that?  Though in fact,  lots of people (presumably not paying from their own pockets) seem to think it's terrific.",5
Wonderful evening.  Excellent service.  Celebrated a special birthday for my spouse which was personally recognized by the staff.  Steaks were perfect.  Butter cake was fantastic!  Great setting for intimate meal as well as large groups.,5
I love this steakhouse it’s one of my favorite spots for dining in NYC!  the 45 day dry aged rib eye with the truffle butter and truffle shavings was exceptional! The Lobster Mac and cheese exceptional! The cocktails & the butter cake with ice cream was a perfect way to end my decadent meal with friends 👌. & of course it wouldn’t have been exceptional if the service wasn’t  up to par which it was! Thanks to Crystal! Overall 🙌👏. I highly recommend this restaurant,5
Dinner was excellent.  The recommendations of the waitress were very good.,5
Had Jenny as our server.  She was wonderful.,5
We have dined at many fine restaurants across the country and this is by far one of the best. The food was prepared perfectly and presented very professionally. The service was wonderful. The wine list is extensive. We highly recommend this if you are in New York.,5
"Bar area was excellent, food  was on point as always!",1
"Great food, great atmosphere and great service!  We celebrated a friend's 40th and our server brought her a card from the staff and gave us a dessert sampler.   He took pictures with us and was just awesome!  We will be back!",5
"We went initially because it was Restaurant Week. We were informed upon arrival that they were not participating even though the reservation was made on Open Table on Restaurant Week links. Anyway, the place was crowded and very noisy. The service was very good.  The food was tasty and the drinks were amazing. While the food was not the best, it was far from the worst and I would likely dine there again.",5
QM jammed our table of 3 next to a table of 20 in a secluded corner.  It was difficult to talk to the guys at our table unless you yelled.  The servers kept apologizing but that didn’t prevent them from focusing their attention on the bigger table.  Definitely not worth the price and an overall poor experience. We won’t be going back.,4
From the moment stepping into Quality Meats the service was impeccable. The bar is a great place for a group to gather in then we were shown to our table upstairs when the group was all there. Food selection is amazing and the bacon/peanut butter was outstanding.,3
The wine chosen for us matched the meal perfectly and everyone had a great time.,5
"Quality Meats' interior is amazing. The hostess was very friendly and greeted us upon entry and made us feel very welcome.  We were seated upstairs which is very cozy.  Our server ""Burdi"" was very attentive and available every time we looked up he was there.  He also made sure our food was right and that the wine was appropriate. Burdi had the perfect balance and took great care of being friendly without being too familiar.  Management take note of that because it is a truly an asset in the restaurant industry! Overall great experience, great wine, great food and amazing desserts try the burnt marshmallow! Only downside is bathroom is way downstairs. Definitely recommend for enjoyable dining experience lunch or dinner.",5
Good staff. Very mediocre steak. Too pricey for the food offerings. Sashimi appetizer was a waste.,3
Superb Steak!,4
The service could of been better. Seem the Waiter was overwhelmed only came to our table 3x in an 2hr stretch.,5
disappointed w/the quality of the ribeye. way too much fat,4
"Very special restaurant. The service is the best and the food perfect. First time here, but will come back many times.",5
Jeff was very accommodating and took great care of us!,5
Long. Wait for entrees with little to no attention from staff while we waited.,5
Amazing ! Delucius !,4
"We love Quality Meats, the food, service, ambiance is PERFECT! We usually go there for special occasions, date news and when we have friends and family in town. We have never had a bad meal here. Once they even forget to give us our leftovers, but by the time we reminded them they had tossed them away - so the offered to offered to make a new one for - and it was one of their higher priced items. The staff - especially waiters are super attentive and nice! We went for my husbands birthday and they gave us the dessert on the house. Can't say enough good thing about this gem. Thank you Qaulity Meats for always making our nights special.",5
"When booking this reservation we were very optimistic that dining gluten free would not be a problem.  Unfortunately, the choices of beef were incredibly limiting because every steak is marinated in soy sauce. The steak choices immediately became few and far between with only a filet mignon as an option. We settle for a pork chop, which was amazing, as was everything else we were able to order; from the charcuterie, to the lobster scampi, to the desserts and cocktails. Our service was outstanding. Regardless of the immense disappointment we experienced not being able to enjoy a steak at Quality Meats, we would return for all the other elements offered.",5
"If you're willing to overlook the prices, the food was amazing, and our waiter made the experience even better. He picked out his favorites from the menu and did not steer kit group wrong. The restaurant itself has great ambiance. Overall, fantastic dining experience!",1
Great service and food,5
Great!!! Love the food !!!,5
Quality changes each visit.  Sometimes excellent sometimes fair.,4
Great space.  Professionals.,5
I have been to Quality Meats on every trip to N.Y . and entertained customers and friends and it is always a perfect meal and people return to dine there ofter.,2
Bravo to Quality Meats .,5
"I have eaten at QM many times. Unfortunately this time was a real dud. The waiter came once and that was it; otherwise we had to flag down lower staff to order anything, send the wrong orders back, get the check.",5
"We ordered sparkling water, but got tap. One of the main courses we ordered wasn't what we ordered. ",3
Just an unpleasant experience DEFINITELY not worth the bill. Will continue going to BLT Steak instead.,5
"We have been there many times, this time, two out of three steaks had to be returned because they were not done to order.",4
Always top drawer from start to finish,5
One of my favorite steaks in NYC,5
"The food was great and if you are looking for ""The scene"", then this is the place. Although waiting for our table was difficult because there was barely any space at the bar, the place was hopping. Also be prepared to wait a little while to check your coat and then to uncheck it.",4
A noisy zoo. Good service. The steak was,2
OK not at all exceptional. Will not go back.,5
The ambience at Del Fresco's is amazing! The food was delicious and delivered quickly and with style!,5
"We had a very nice pre-theater dinner with bone-on filet mignon, roasted cauliflower with brie and potatoes and onion, took a piece of the lemon cake to go to eat post-theater, highly recommended, service was friendly and great!",5
The food is always consistently good!,5
Wonderful restaurant with terrific food and vibrant ambiance.,5
The food was amazing. Every dish was completely engulfed. And the crab cakes are amazing!,4
"excellent wine list, food was outstanding! Waitress Judy was very personable. Whole experience was amazing.",4
Food was Great. would have liked to see a few more non steak items. My family loves steak but I am not a huge fan. but I know you are a Steakhouse sooooooooo.,3
I think also something should accompany a $67.00 steak. like maybe a baked potato instead of charging $8.00 for one.,4
"Good meat, very good service but a bit too noisy to have a good conversation.",4
"Great food / service, ruined by a table in the back room instead of the main restaurant, not somewhere you want to spend $500 on a meal",1
Excellent meat and an incredible CORN CREME BRULE. Very noisy!!,5
"Went twice this week, both times the waiter was a little too cocky and one was unwilling to do a change on a salad. Seems ridiculous as it's a salad presumably made from scratch.",3
Every aspect was perfect,5
Great food and ambiance! Definitely will come back!,5
"Took almost 45 minutes to take our first wine order, the wine we wanted they didn't have, took another 15 or so mins to get the following order taken. The clam chowder we ordered just never came. Our waiter seemed to really not give a damn about his job.",1
Best NYC steakhouse...,5
Ribs slightly over cooked saice had a bitter taste seemed to be slightly burnt,4
The bacon with peanut butter and jelly is amazing.,4
"A very bad experience. Having to wait 50 minutes to get a table when a booking is made one month in advance is simply outrageous and proves that the management of this restaurant only thinks about revenue not client's satisfaction. Even though later on they tried to fix the mess with some free starters and side dishes, the damage was done. ",1
"About the food compared with other steakhouses in NYC this one is below average, so I simply feel that this place is clearly overrated and an insult how they treat customers. Of course I will never go back neither recommend this place to anybody.",4
I actually expected a dressier place.  There were many in t-shirts.  I should have done better research.  Service was attentive.,5
"This the first steakhouse i went to at new york and I LOVE IT！We had 2 dozen oysters, which taste so fresh. The steak did not let me down. Waffle fries and the quality mule also good. I am not fan of crab n avocado, but my friends like it. The foie gras is a little too salty for me，however the texture is perfect. ",2
Not perfect overall. But i will definitely come back！,2
Avg experience,5
"have been here before. tonight was an early birthday dinner before the theatre.  one waiter for 4 tables. of course, he took all the orders from everyone the same time, so it took like 20 minutes for him to submit to the kitchen as each table had questions etc. must have told the waiter at least 4 times, to please make sure we have time for the great ice cream desserts to enjoy. long story short ..it took 20 minutes to get the dessert leaving us 3 min. to eat everything. some birthday treat!  ",4
ordered 3 glasses of wine and he ran out when pouring the third..never came back to pour the full glass. ,4
hate paying a lot of money for poor service.,5
"This was my second visit to QM, and it was another excellent experience.  The food was outstanding and the service was excellent.  If you're looking to satisfy your inner carnivore, this is the place to go.  And the desserts were outstanding as well.",5
"The overall experience was  very good starting with the seafood tower and porkbelly appetizers--outstanding.  The Filet mignon, enjoyed by several at the table, was phenomenal.  The only disappointment was the Porterhhouse, as it was dry, and no of the level that one would expect here.",5
I will be back to have the Filet!,5
Good food and service but very very very very NOISY!,5
It was my boyfriend's birthday. He loved my choice. I mentioned it was his birthday on open table and to our surprise they bought over one of their house made ice cream for him. The food was AMAZING! Loved every bit of this restaurant.,4
"One of my favorite steak houses in NYC.  Last time I went a few years ago it was exceptional.  This time was still really good, but I think my memories of the outstanding experience I had previously held my standard to a very high level.  Overall, I was very satisfied..",3
We had a great tasty dinner after a friend's recommendation... we are very pleased that we listened to him. It was a wonderful dinner. The service was extraordinary. It was a perfect evening. Worth the cost. Mostly recommended. Will come back again,3
"Excellent place to dine in NYC.  We loved the service, food and atmosphere.",5
The food was beyond compare. Excellent wait staff.,5
"we went to Quality Meats for our 10th anniversary dinner. We got the crab cake appetizer, the bone-in filet, Quality potato, broccoli cheese bites, and the toasted marshmallow icecream. Crab cake was great, filet was a great cut of meat and perfectly cooked, however slightly over salted (husband is a steak snob) so that was a little bit of a turn off. The Quality potatoes was good, broccoli cheddar bites great. The ice cream was our favorite part, and complimentary since it was our anniversary. I definitely recommend QM.",2
"I've been to quality meats and quality italian before for both business and personal meals, and usually had a good experience until this latest one. ",4
"I took a party of three (including myself) to quality meats on a Friday evening and left feeling guilty of leaving a tip of 15%, what I consider to be the bare minimum, wishing I had left 0%. I felt rushed the whole time with rude service and seemingly had to ask for things that are typically standard.",5
"For instance, after ordering drinks and our meal they took our bread plates away without giving us any bread. I thought that was odd but attributed it to the waiter just forgetting, not a big deal. We decided to then ask for bread and the waiter comes back and plops the bread on the table without any plates. ",5
"Then after our meal (the steak was good as usual, can't go wrong w/ porterhouse for two and bone-in sirloin) after ordering dessert, we were contemplating ordering a post-steak drink but we didn't get a chance to as the bill arrives at the table without anyone asking for it. This was a few minutes before 10, and I think they close at 10:30 so it's not like they had other customers to take our table. I don't expect service like this from a place like quality meats when there are plenty of other steakhouses with better service.",3
"I was very disappointed in the service at Quality Meats when I went on Friday night.  I felt extremely rushed from start to finish. This was a special birthday dinner, and for such a nice restaurant like this, I wasn't expecting to be in and out in less than 1 hour. We were told we had to order all the dishes at once, and couldn't put in appetizers first and wait a bit until we put in the entrees. Also, the food came out way too fast as if they were shoving it down our throats. I likely never re-visit this restaurant as I don't think this place is suitable for people looking to enjoy their evening dining out.",4
Our waiter Dominic was outstanding! The food was delicious as always. Amazing service. Cool place. Amazing food. Quality meats never fails to amaze me with there delicious steaks and steak sauce.,5
"Personnel service, quality food, table space and the context were excellents! The value for money was perfect. I strongly recommend it for any occasion, business included. For sure I'll return.",4
Service needs not great and waiter had the audacity to question why I had not given a 20% tip.,5
Quality Meats never disappoints.  I have been a patron of this establishment for several years now and I cannot wait to go again!!,3
"Perfect marriage between the old and the new. If you're looking for a classic NY steakhouse with your standard creamed spinach and crab cakes, look elsewhere. Quality meats has both classically prepared steak and the creativity of a new American fine dining establishment.",5
"Del Frisco's was a very nice experience. The food was good quality. However, I would have a hard time recommending them because I felt there are other steak houses that provide a better experience for the same or less money. I am glad we went, but we did not feel it was a good value for the premium money we spent.",3
Everything was great except that we had to wait 45 minutes for our table ... i don;t mind 15-20 minutes and hang at the bar but 45 minutes is a bit much,3
"Had reservation for 6:45 pm on a Saturday evening...we were greeted with the fact that they were running a little late, and we could expect a table in 15 minutes and suggested that we wait in the bar.",5
"The bar was so crowded that we could not find anywhere to stand and ""not be in the way""",2
45 minutes later... we were finally seated at a table location that was so crowded to adjacent tables that the wait staff had to walk around the table next to us to get to the other side of our table.,5
"However, food quality and service very good...energetic and friendly staff",2
I guess it should be when some steak specials were in the $60.to $80 range.,4
"Excellent food, drink, ambience, view, inside decor, pleasant staff, great desserts.",4
Manager was generous and happy and classy. Our favorite restaurant experience ever.,5
It's a perfect NYC five star restaurant,2
"Maybe I had to high expectation about this restaurant. Don't get me wrong, the food was not bad, but it was not the level I expected and as well not the right level if you consider how much you pay. I ordered a prime strip 16 oz and I ordered it medium as I expected in a restaurant like this you dont have to order it medium rare to get it medium. Wrong thought's, I rather should have ordered it medium rare to get it medium. Anyway, the steak was ordered medium and I got it rather well done. A shame for such a nice peace of meat.",5
But the food was not what annoyed me the most. We had to wait half an hour eventhough we had a reservation and the noise was extrem. I barely couldn't understand what my friends were saying.,5
"WOW! Without a doubt, one of Manhattan's best restaurants. Fantastic food and the best steak in New York. Only quibble: service is overly-attentive, and we were rushed along so as to free up the table.",4
"This restaurant has gone downhill! In pursuit of the almighty dollar, they have jammed more tables in, to the point where the staff can barely fit between tables.",5
"In the past, the food here has been exceptional. And, to be fair, the steaks (which is why we came) were excellent. But the rest of the food was lackluster. The bread & butter on the table was equivalent to Wonder bread with a sesame seeds on it topped with whipped butter that was too thin. The crust was weak, the bread was soft, and the taste was bland.",5
"The salads were bland, and the sides so-so. The wine was fantastic (but, they can't claim that). It was a very good meal for an ""average"" restaurant. For for $500 (for 3 people), it was horrible. Never again.",2
"Service and view were greaat! Food was very good, but I've had better for less cost.",5
"Expensive, but if you can afford it, a very nice place to eat in NYC. Reserved for 4:45, so we beat most of the happy hour/dinner rush.. We had exceptional service. The crab cake was delicious, but not sure it was $20 delicious. The cuts of steak were great, we got the ribeye and strip. The only complaint I have about the steaks is that too much butter was used. It kind of overpowered the ribeye in flavor, due to the ribeye not being too thick, but the strip was easily 1.5-2 inches thick, and it was perfect. Also, I think charging $8.50 per bottle of Stella is a tad steep. With all that being said, It really is a nce place, great views of the city streets from our table, and it is right across from Fox News. Can't beat that.",5
"Always great food and fantastic A+ service. A bit pricey and lunch is more a business crowd, but worth it. Go for the lemon cake dessert.",4
"Salesmen on expense accounts seem to love this place. Huge portions of very mediocre food at outragiously high prices. Expenive drinks ($20 for a martini). Not at all worth the price. There are many, many other steak houses in New York City that have far better food and are more resaonably priced.",5
"Wow. Excellent food, friendly and attentive service. Cheerfully accommodated our guest's late arrival (due to horrible traffic) and managed to get him a meal despite limited time (we had theater tickets.) All in all a great experience. We will be back.",5
This was my first time to NY and I would have to say this was the highlight of our dining experience!,5
Food was outstanding and we had a great view of Radio City Music Hall - which was the show we were attending after dinner- so that was special.,5
The service was excellent!!!!,5
"Very nice evening, the waitress knocked over a glass of red wine over us while clearing the table and they gave us 2 very generous desserts, which we couldn't finish :) Beautiful interior and mood at this restaurant, I highly recommend it if you are trying to impress someone",5
"Great food, not cheap but worth it. Great bar to people watch & great view of 6th avenue.",5
This is the best steakhouse I have ever been to! We have the Keg and other private steakhouses around our home and there is no comparison.,5
Really enjoyed!!,5
Our first experience and it was outstanding. Service was first rate and the food was fabulous.  I would highly recommend.,5
it is hard to review a restaurant with a good perspective when your waiter is rude and cocky.,2
Would highly recommend for a variety of Italian foods and steak. So if you have people with differing tastes great place to go.,4
Had the special - steak with crab filled cannoli.  Had a little error on the ordering of sides so we ended up with both the asparagus and the brussels sprouts terrific on both counts. Yummy gelato for dessert. John did a great job recommending wine paying attention but not too overbearing,5
"We celebrated an anniversary here and it was our first time at Quality. It was such a perfect choice for the celebration, the food was fabulous (even better than expected), the drinks were great, and the service was outstanding. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place to all of my friends and we'll certainly be back again.",1
Amazing service and good! Chicken Parmesan is a must.,5
This restaurant was horrible the service was horrible the food was beyond horrible on edible it is a tourist trap and nobody should ever go there,5
The best restaurant! Everything is alsways incredible at Quality Italian!,5
"Excellent food, excellent service, excellent ambiance - all around A+++",5
"Have been coming here since it opened, the food, atmosphere, people never disappoint. Always ask for Brad as your server.",5
"Start to finish, every dish hit the mark.  Creative and delicious.  Our only regret was we could not eat more.  When we left, we were all very full.  Service was outstanding.  We will definitely be back.",4
"the food and energy were amazing...loved our party for a bday here, table of 8. ",4
Kind of should explain about the money going to charity as it was SUPER expensive..,3
"Great food. W Italian in the name, I expected pasta options, but there were none. ",5
"Regardless, great good. Great service.",4
one of the most consistent meals you can have in midtown.,5
I have eaten here a number of times and have not had a bad meal.,4
Service was incredibly slow.,4
"The chicken parm pizza is worth every penny!  The service is always fantastic and the atmosphere is energetic, but you can still enjoy an intimate conversation.",4
Great service and food.  Prompt service and very helpful.,5
Fantastic food. Delicious appetizers and entrees. The noise level and choice of music are just terrible.,5
Food was amazing but service was really bad. Waiter was pretty rude and bus boys never cleared the tables in a timely fashion so kind of a mess.,5
"Finally had an opportunity to visit QI and it did not disappoint.  Excellent service, outstanding food, but very noisy. I had trouble conversing with my guest.",5
Chicken Parmesan was really tasty and successful. Believe me it is enough for two. Vine option was wide and the staff was very  polite and helpful,5
Amazing food and terrific service.,5
Was our second time there.  Will come back again when in the City.,5
One of my favorite restaurants. Think the food and ambience are terrific - upbeat and,2
elegant.,2
Wow! Blown away by the food here.   I took a photo of our chicken parm... it was ridiculously good and original in the approach. It looked like a pizza. Outstanding.,4
"Great food, creative and very tasty. service was amazing as well ",2
very recommended,3
Was celebrating out anniversary.   Service could not have been better.  Brought us out 2 complementary glasses of champagne.,5
"What a great, festive place.  A bit heavy leaded so don't go if your not ready to really eat.  They pour an honest drink and portions are huge.  For NYC, prices are outstanding....",5
Go with friends and be ready to share.  And have a blast!,5
Food is not so great as the name suggests (Italian Quality). It lacks flavor.  The restaurant is extremely noisy. Waiters pressuring to pay the check and leave the table.,5
"Service was terrible! Waiter never came back to refill the wine glasses. My husband had to get the bottle out of the chiller and pour it for us. Was excited to try Quality Italian, but ended up disappointed :(",2
"We had a party of four, we're all in hospitality (I'm a GM, brought my Chef and our dates) and we loved every facet of our experience there. We had to wait about 20min past our reservation time, but that was the only hitch. The menu has a good balance of classics and some inventive dishes. The wines were reasonably priced and the labels we tried were excellent. The service was probably some of the best I've received in recent memory.",5
"I had been to Quality Meats (sister restaraunt) which is great.  I thought this would actually be italian cuisine, which it isn't.  However, dinner was great...but its an italian steak house.  Who know? I wonder if I was the only clueless first time customer to QI who thought that.",4
"Three (out of 4) of us had romaine salad with seared tuna. There was much too much dressing on the salad, and tasted like wishbone dressing from the refrigerator. the tuna was stringy on some plates. Ambiance was good and looks like a good place to go after work for drinks and hang.",2
"Juicy steaks, savory roast chicken, a ""vastly under-appreciated pork chop"" (in the words of our server) comprise the gustatory delights at Quality Italian. The younger sibling of Quality Meats, QI offers thoughtful and professional service with plenty of personality, a varied wine list and hearty servings for foodies and visiting firemen alike. We will definitely be back!",5
"Best meal from start to finish. Fabulous service. The chicken parm pizza is amazing, as well as, the bread and corn brûlée ! I would highly recommend Quality Italian. It is indeed quality.",5
I keep coming back to QI for the food and the attentive service.,5
Their signature Chicken Parmagiana is a great share dish.  The presentation is awesome.,3
Sauces are what sometimes makes a dish go from being good to great and many of the QI dishes have amazing sauce... like the baked clams and the agnolotti.  I used my fresh baked bread to slop up all the sauce from the dish.  Mom taught me to always clean my plate haha.,5
"This was our 2nd time at the restaurant. Our first experience was fantastic. Fantastic meal, great wine and fabulous service. Unfortunately our second visit missed the mark.  While the food was good, the service was off the mark.  Support staff got it done, but our main server was a mess. We were waiting for the fourth guest to arrive and he asked us what we would like to drink, then disappeared. It took about 20 minutes to get his attention as he was staring off into space and appeared to be avoiding eye contact with our table. When all four of us were seated I was finally able to wave him down. He answered our questions in a harsh manner like we were bothering him. Its important to note that as the night went on he got mildly better.",5
"Excelente food, croquettes are a most try, the service impeccable, I just have to say go and try it, you won't regretted ( reservations are a most)",4
"Loved it, 5th time there.  Food is great, amazing chopped salads :)  Staff is very  friendly and professional.  Love the ambiance and decor.  Can get a little loud when it is full. Will definitely go back.",4
"Love the restaurant!   Food, atmosphere, people, chefs all excellent.  EXCEPT our most recent waiter Matt H.   He seemed he could care less about serving us.  I asked him about specials although I saw him freely offering specials and suggestions to others. He assumed my 21 year old daughter was under age as he immediately swept the wine glass from her setting as we arrived.  Examined her license like he was a police detective -very distrusting.  NO personality unless he was looking for an acting job with that qualification.  Too bad.  Will always frequent QI but will stay clear of Matt H.",3
"Waited too long for seared scallops that weren't ideally prepared, my guests were happy with their pasta and veal, though.",5
"My wife and I were out for a romantic evening.  We were shoe horned in between loud talking guests, so close together you could not help but be distracted.  Maybe this is normal in NYC but was definitely an unpleasant surprise to us.",5
The food and service is always excellent and consistent.  Always one of my go to spots.,4
"Four of us went on Sunday evening at 8.30 pm. The wait to take our order was a little long but did not in any way impact our experience. The food was awesome, the whole table went for different steaks. While our waiter was good we had a guy who was bussing the table called brad who was a delight. All in all there was not one complaint from anyone at the table.",3
"Loved the restaurant, including the atmosphere, drinks and food. Service could use some work, especially our waiter, Matt. He was truly dreadful. Never have I experienced a more condescending, rude or obnoxious waiter.",5
Went on a busy Saturday night.   Service subpar to say the least.  Overflowing with tourists.  Go or the chicken parm for 2...which would serve 4 and is really good...don't expect the Quality experience you get at Quality Meats which is a much better place in my opinion.  Maybe a weeknight or business lunch is a better experience.,1
Service and food perfect. Wine was great too our server was very knowledgable with pairing wine with our meals!! Def will return!!! Save room for the Nutella gelato it was delicious and great too see different creations on whole menu opposed to same ol italian cuisine.,4
"Have eaten here before with good food and enjoyable. Ordered our food in a regular manner. This time it was excessively spiced up which became more apparent by the end of the meal. My date and I suffered from ""heartburn"" following the meal. Can no longer recommend this place to others in the future. Food inconsistent.",4
Chicken parm was amazing as was the cesear salad and cracked lobster,4
"It's true...it's amazing. Its like a pizza but better. There were 3 of us-2 adults, 1 child. We ordered the chicken parm, a side of pasta, and a side of broccoli rabe. The portions were huge and I as the lucky one who got to take home the doggie bag. The drinks at the downstairs bar were very strong, meaning excellent.",2
"We had a nice dinner with our two daughters (10 and 14yrs) on Saturday night.   Started out sharing the ceaser and chopped NY salad, which were both very tasty and different.  The chef sliced the petit filet perfectly for the girls. The bone-in ribeye was perfect as was the Dover sole.  Great wine list which we started into with a class of the QI prosecco that was reasonably priced and refreshing.  Service was good despite the busy crowd.  Would go back but I liked the ambience of Quality Meats better since QI is loud.",4
"Quality Italian had a noise level that reminded me of being in a stadium. The majority of diners were businessmen in the 25-40 age category. It is not a place to go as a couple or with friends when you may want to have conversations. The service was good as was the food, buy still not worth having to be in a deafening restaurant. They were packed so the noise level must not bother everyone.",5
"Great spot for lunch.  Menu is somewhat limited, but covers beef, seafood, and great salad customized salad choices",5
"Great service, good food. I like that I had options, at an italian restaurant, to have heavy or light options for lunch.",5
The twin spicy lobster rolls were the tastiest ever!,4
"Went out with 5 other folks for my wife's birthday. We had a wonderful time. We did not have to wait for our reservation, we had a round table which I always prefer for groups bigger than 4. The food and service were outstanding. I am already looking forward to going back.",5
"It is a very good restaurant, the food is absolutely delicious. ",4
The bar at street level has a great ambiance.,5
First time and he food was amazing!  And my two waiters Were fantastic!  I will certainly be back!,5
"From the moment we were greeted, the dining experience at Quality Italian was beyond fantastic! The ambiance is lovely with muted lighting and tasteful music.  The menu offers such a vast array of choices that it is hard to come to a decision.  I highly recommend the corn brulee - it is beyond decadent!  The dessert menu, headed by Pastry Chef Cory Colton, is superior and tastefully varied.",5
Awesome food and service. My husband and I had dinner here with my son and his girlfriend. Even though they both work in Manhattan they usually prefer Brooklyn for drinks and dinner. They made the ultimate sacrifice to hang out with us in the ultimate tourist trap of 57th and 5th on a Friday night. ,4
"We had a great time and the food was fabulous. We had clams for appetizer and sirloin, lamb chop, pasta and eggplant for dinner along with several sides. All awesome!  We topped it off by sharing the zeppolli dessert which was a pleasant surprise",4
This is a very energetic lively restaurant with amazing decor and delicious food.  Jumbo shrimp were excellent and the steak outstanding.  The pasta dish was one of the best I have ever eaten.  Another wonderful NYC dining experience.,5
Excellent dinner. Creative appetizers. Exceeded all expectations.,1
"Great wine list, but way overpriced.  Food was low quality.  I think the chicken parm from 5 days ago is still sitting in my stomach, and calling it chicken is a stretch since it was very tough and chewy.  I would not return.",5
The eggplant ant the pork chop are to die for. Hands down one of my favorite restaurants in NYC.,4
"I thought this was going to be more of a cookie cutter type steakhouse but it is the opposite. Creative menu, very well prepared food and excellent service. Great for a business dinner. Will definitely be back.",5
"we were a big, indecisive group.  The staff was patient and helpful and was right on point with recommendations.  With no exceptions, everyone was impressed with the meal, and being a big group we had the opportunity to try a lot of menu items.  very glad we chose QI.",5
"At least as good as Quality Meats, its sister restaurant.  The steak was wonderful, the pasta appetizers large and tasty (if you aren't too hungry, you could easily have one of them plus a salad and call it dinner) and the sides unique.  Plus, our servers Natasha and Victor were the best!",5
"I fell in love with this place, the decor is beautiful.",1
the food is just amazing!,5
Chicken Parm is a must!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
"We had a terrible experience at Quality Italian.  Quality it was not.  The polpetto with eggplant was mushy dense and tasteless.  We had to send it back.  My $52 dollar dover sole was nothing special. Forgettable.  The signature chicken parmesan was a sheet of mozzarella over again, dense, breaded tasteless chicken.  Nothing was good. Sorry.",5
Absolutely amazing....,5
"The wait at the table was a little long - and right away our server came over, addressed it and sent an appetizer.  How cool is that.  A great way to start the relationship.  We were there at 10 PM on a Saturday night - and the place was packed.  Our food - service - was off the charts.  Had the Oysters - some of the best I have eaten.  Tried the sole special - outstanding, and a few sides (spinach, artichoke mac)    We had an A plus super tuscan.....Guidolberto.  If you like Ambiance - you will love Quality Italian.  If you value amazing service - this is a MUST GO!",2
"When I booked my reservation online using opentable.com I put a note in the special requests just stating that it was my anniversary with my girlfriend.  When we were approached by the waiter after ordering our drinks he surprised us with complimentary glasses of shampagne ($25 value) and then congratulated us on our anniversary.  It was a great touch and really surprised my girlfriend that I put that comment in the reservation.  Then, when we got our dinner we were given a complimentary side dish of the macaroni artichoke ($10 value), which was amazing!  We were stuffed from the great food but then out came a complimentary dessert ($10 value).  The service was phenomenal and the food somehow was even better.  We will go back for sure!!",5
"Usually you get the porterhouse steak with tons of butter, however the Fiorentina with olive oil , rosemary &thyme is superior, at least to me  . The quality of the meat was superb, grilled to perfection, starters & deserts very good.",4
This food is so good!!!  Chicken Parm is exceptional.  I only wish I could figure out how they made it so I could re-create it at home!,2
"Very noisy restaurant. I wish the internet had sound bites as well as pictures. I asked for romantic but was seated between 2 tables of two, 16 inches apart from either side of our table. The food was over priced. My husband had the swordfish and the portion was small. I ordered lemon blackened chicken and it was a leg/thigh combination that was hard to eat "" ladylike"". We ordered Caesar salad that was loaded with dressing and wilting. We also ordered fingerling potatoes that were honestly tasteless that I could have made at home. Sorry but one hundred dollars later, bad choice. Sad in Ohio!",5
Love this place! Everything is just right. The corn creme brûlée is a must and the eggplant polpette is delicious. Must go!,2
"First time dining at Quality Italian.  Baked clams outstanding, Chicken parm for two good would have like it better if it was a thinner cuttlet.",1
Would like to try the veal shank for two on our next trip there.,5
"place is pretty, and the servers were very professional and prompt however the food is only a notch or two above a chain restaurant.",4
"I took my newly engaged fiance of 6 hours here for dinner, and we had a great time! The food was great and our waiter was outstanding. It's basically a steakhouse with nicely prepared Italian options on the menu. You can't go wrong.",5
medium rare is pretty rare here,3
huge portions ,5
felt like the cheesecake factory,5
the crudo items were delicious and finely prepared.  the rest was average.  and below average when you consider the prices.,5
"Please DO NOT order the LOBSTER DIAVOLO, I'm still traumitized over how disgusting this dinner was.",5
I have no clue why I did'nt return it and order something else? Maybe I was tipsy and could'nt think straight.,5
"My friend ordered the steak, she did'nt like it either. The bread I must say is fabulous, and all around very nice staff including: ",5
"the hostess, waiters, food runners, and managers were very friendly. ",5
I like Quality steak (even though it smells like meat locker).,5
Service and food were  very good.  Prices were high for the amount of food offered.  e.g.  $31 for a plate of pasta.  side dishes were 20+.,5
The food was way too salty. I was even suffering until next day.,5
"We are loyal patrons of Quality Italian and it's been one of our family's favorites for the past few years. The service is still excellent, but we were very disappointed by the recent changes to the menu.  Some of our favorite items (e.g., oysters appetizer, pasta with eggplant entree) were removed from the menu and others changed in preparation (e.g., branzino entree).  The changes are probably a result of the change in chefs, but we hope they decide to return to the original menu we know and love.",5
Anything you order you won't be disappointed excellent Italian restaurant service is always amazing,5
Fantastic experience and our wait staff was extremely efficient and knowledgeable about the menu.  One of the best meals I've had in a long time!,5
Food is really delicious and well-made here. Service is what it should be - I'd strongly recommend this place.,5
We recently visited NYC with 8 girls....and we were recommended Quality Italian by a GM that works in NYC and is from our home town...,5
"What a fantastic experience, food was excellent, service was top notch, and we were all so very pleased with our experience.  I know the whole group would highly recommend this restaurant!",4
The food was definetly not worth the price. The restaurant is nice and our server was the best part of the meal.,3
"One of the best restaurants I've ever been too. Everything is delicious! Love the Beet Gnudi, Chicken Parm, Grilled Branzino and great wine list. Staff is knowledgable and attentive but atmosphere is still casual. Love QI!!",5
Our server JD was awesome!!! Food and wine was amazing:-),5
The entire staff was welcoming and gracious.  The service was attentive without being arrogant.  Food was delicious and the portions were generous. Sides are sharable.  Desserts decadent. Look forward to returning!,5
"Our server was a major reason we had a poor experience. The menu was hard to understand and she guided us to order way too much food and guided us away from the dishes that we said we wanted. So, we didn't enjoy the food as much because it wasn't what we were anticipating. She was extremely difficult to understand (very thick accent) and we could tell she felt she was above us. She looked down on us for not being regulars. She basically ruined our experience.",5
"Our waiter, Ken, was very attentive to our needs and was very engaging!  Food was excellent!  It was overly busy for lunch, but dinner is quite busy. If you want to try it out, but don't want to have to wait long, go and try the ""brunch"" menu on the weekends!  Great selection!",3
The meal and service was amazing! The chicken parm pizza was great and so filling. The 9 year olds loved it and the Garlic bread. The waiter could not have been nicer. They were fast to and did not rush us!,5
"I'm not sure if I will ever eat here again, maybe if someone else is paying, I would def try the pasta next time.",5
Thank you so much for taking care of my people.  You always go above and beyond.  It is sincerely appreciated.,4
"They are still raving about the scallops and the corn creme brulee!  Mission accomplished!!!!  I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a business lunch, special occasion, or romantic dinner!",5
"It was my debut at this restaurant and overall it was a positive experience. The waiter seemed a bit eager to take our order but better that than have to wonder who is looking after us. We ordered the veal shank for two and it was truly the largest shank I have ever seen. Because it was being shared, the waiter removed it from the bone table side and spread the meat across a plate. I think something is lost in the experience by having it taken off the bone. The meat was moist and tender and we thoroughly enjoyed it. Another person at the table ordered the branzino which we were less joyful over. The portion was small and not the tastiest of branzinos we have eaten. The waiter was nice and attentive but lacking in personality.",5
Always an amazing dining experience at Quality Italian !!,5
Everything on the menu is superb combined with First Class Service !,5
Thank You QI !!,2
Victor & Courtney,3
"This was a fabulous meal. My husband and I shared uni-baked scampi, beefsteak tomato salad, and fresh ricotta with honey and pine nuts as starters. All delicious. The scampi was tender and juicy, highly flavorful. Lovely texture on the ricotta, served with thick slices of lightly toasted, hearty bread. I had a porterhouse stuffed agnolotti pasta as my entree. It was tender and tasty, served in a browned butter sauce.  A side of brussels sprouts was very nicely done, roasted with a balsamic vinegar reduction.  The pasta was fresh, rolled thin and with a nice texture.  Even though we were beyond full, we shared a lemon tart for dessert. Not too sweet, great with a cup of coffee.  (I spotted a cannoli cart and was tempted by it, but I'm a bit of a purist regarding cannoli, and really, there's only one acceptable stuffing.)  Service was excellent, attentive but not overbearing.  Bar service was very prompt, and my husband was happy with a generous scotch pour.  The wine list is very nice, if a bit overpriced.  Not much to choose from under $100.  Room is attractive and had a good buzz.  My only complaint was recorded music played pretty loudly.  Together with the room noise, it was a bit hard to talk.  Nevertheless, I wouldn't hesitate to go back. Can't wait, actually.",4
"Confused !!! Isn't a chopped salad chopped ?? That's what the menu states ""chopped salad"" but it's not chopped just a regular salad . Priced as an entree but it's not served that size . Then add chicken at $21 but don't expect a decent serving of that either!! Outrageous",4
Service was good but that's about it. Find somewhere better,5
Relatively small amounts of food for exceedingly large sums of money.,5
Great food,5
Disappointed that they only offer Chicken Parm for 2... no single serving???,5
"Great Italian choices, big wine list in heart of midtown",4
"We have been living in Manhattan for almost 40 years and  have eaten at many great restaurants. There are so many great places to dine at in midtown that sometimes it's hard to choose where to go. So last night we said, ""let's go to Quality Italian"" and we did. We choose wisely. It's a busy place on two levels with a bar off the street and dining rooms on a second level. Very well designed space that was jammed with a nice crowd at the bars and tables. They have a great menu of Italian inspired dishes, appetizers and entrees, ranging from great pastas, steaks, chops and seafood. Plus they have an awesome wine list that is curated by a very personal and knowledgeable wine director, who helped us choose a great bottle for this occasion. The porterhouse angolotti, lamb chops, filet mignon, and cantelope ice cream were all delicious. Every person in the waitstaff and managers who we met were very friendly and personable. Go there! Eat! Drink! Have fun! Then try one of their sister restaurants too. Buon appetite!",5
Wine list is too expensive as well as pastas. Food is great. Other than that great.,4
"This was our first time visiting Quality Italian, we had an amazing time.  The food and service was superb and we will definitely recommend this spot to our family and friends. Can't wait to visir again!!!",4
"Very nice food, service and ambiance in Midtown Manhattan.",5
Good wine list as well.,5
The ambiance was amazing!! Definitely recommend the chicken parmesan pizza.. We had an amazing dinner..,1
"Great staff, delicious, well-served food.",5
Our busser was very attentive but our waiter was not. I expected better.,5
Wonderful place. New favorite   The lamb bolonese cavatelli was the best pasta I've ever tried. Corn Brule always a must.,5
Really nice experience! The quality chicken palm is dreadfully delicious! And all the dishes and deserts we had are great too. Also the service is wonderful! I definitely will recommend it to all my friends!,4
Birthday,5
Excellent food,5
Great service,5
"Service was amazing and the food was incredible!  I highly recommend the lobster rigatoni and the strawberry shortcake ""humor me"" gelato for dessert!  YUM!!!",3
Absolutely love Quality Italian! The baked clams are fantastic. The 57 spritz (signature cocktail) is made with grapefruit and so fresh and light. Would highly recommend the veal chop Milanese!,2
"Must order the chicken Parmesan for two, though four is more like it.",5
The chicken parm was excellent. The atmosphere was relaxed and the lighting was nice. The wine selection was good. I keep it from a five because of all the conversations by the waiters by the table. I dont care to here the opinions of how you feel when people order water.,4
"Went here for a business dinner and loved it. We had the seafood tower along with the famous chicken cutlet. Had a text from my customer the next day that said "" best meal I've had in years, thank you!"" ...",5
"Quality Italian is a regular stop for me. Great food, attentive service and vibrant atmosphere. Love the tomatoes and stracciatelle as well as their house made steak sauce.",5
"Food was fantastic, great size for the octopus, nice ambience, a bit noisy",5
"Food was good but not exceptional.  Prices were reasonable for NYC, but wine list was incredibly over-priced (eg $90 for a $22 bottle).  Loud and high energy.",3
"I brought my wife to this restaurant based upon a CBS Saturday Morning feature with the owner of this restaurant. I find the Chef's feature on this news show is a useful mechanism for gleaning new restaurant recommendations. If I get many more experiences like this evening, I'll need to rethink my strategy. ",4
Amazing food must try grilled eggplant appetizer!!,5
"The salads (gem chef salad and chopped Italian) were heavy handed. Too much dressing, too much salt, too much bacon bits... well, I think you get the picture. The steak cut was excellent but the waiters screwed up who got what.  The polenta was horrendous. Largely cheesy and some hint of mint (bizarre). I don't mind spending $26 for a glass of wine but I'm expecting a decent pour and not to be nickled and dimed.  Al-in-all... a ridiculously expensive, over rated mess. Stay away.",5
Best chicken parm ever,5
Love Quality Italian...,4
Delicious meal!,3
Great service!,5
Everything was great. The food was excellent. Nice portions. The service was perfect. Never needed to look for attention while not being intrusive. We loved our dinner experience at Quality Italian. The only regret - we were too full for dessert. Next time.,2
"I hosted a friend and restaurant critic to lunch Wednesday and was disappointed. I had set her expectations for fine dinning as I have always had excellent quality at Marea. We both ordered the Dover Sole which I have had many times prior at Marea and it was over salted an overcooked to the point of being rubbery. Our server was earnest but 2x interrupted our conversation (he lacked any nuance in his service and was overly nervous). A black fly also landed on our food which I find inexcusable in a quality establishment. There was no comment made when I left 70% of my Dover Sole uneaten at the end of the meal.  I will return and give Marea another chance because I have had so many outstanding meals prior, My friend however will not and an opportunity with her was lost.",2
"Amazing dinning experience!  My wife and I were blown away by the food, service and decor.  Well worth the late reservation.  I would recommend that everyone go!",5
"The food was great , really the top quality in NY. The down side was Too much staff and not at the level of the food . Most of them were distracted and Except for the receptionist none of the waiters was smiling. The overall feeling was very tense , not over polite , just not relaxed .",3
Had a great meal. Really great staff and the food was amazing. The restaurant even gave me and my wife a extra couple of desserts because it was out honeymoon.,5
I've been here quite a few times and each time it has been fantastic. The food is delicious and the front of house staff is very accommodating. ,5
"It was a birthday gift for a special friend. I was hoping to make the evening special.  When we were seated, they put us at a table in the middle of the room right outside the kitchen in the wine cellar.   When asked to move us to one of four empty tables, the seater had to ""get permission"" and left us standing in the middle of the room.  Very uncomfortable!!   The wait service was slow. So though the food was good, there are many other steak places in Manhattan that I would try before returning to Del Friscos.  A huge disappointment!!",1
Hands down the best restaurant we have ever dined in!,5
My wife and I went to Marea for our anniversary. The food was excellent and the service was exceptional. We were treated to a couple of complimentary desserts and were blown away by them.  The wait staff is without a doubt on point and delivered in a huge way.,4
"Lovely restaurant, met our expectations. looking forward to dining there again. Food presentation was creative as well as delicious.",5
"I celebrated my 65th birthday with my sister, who flew into town to celebrate with me. They honored my seating location request and surprised me with a dessert with a candle. The food was EXCELLENT and the service SUPERB! Everyone had a smile and wished me happy birthday., which I only mentioned in the comments on my online reservation, so they actually read it and made it special.",5
"The food was amazing, everything fresh and delicious. The servers were really attentive. The sommelier was really helpful. We really enjoyed our experience at Marea and we will definitely go back!",5
Also - I added a note on open table that we were celebrating a birthday and they did surprise us with a complimentary dessert with a candle.,5
"Outstanding service, great food, and a beautiful restaurant.",3
It deserves 6 stars!,5
雰囲気はとても良いが、味付けがしょっぱく非常に残念,4
"Amazing dinner, really had a great time and food was excellent.",5
"Great food, as always. Service?  Not so much this time. Oh well. One expected more from a Michelin Star restaurant.",2
"This was by far the best eating experience I have ever had. The fusilli with octopus was beyond delicious, the crude frsh , the scallops delectably cooked and the ciocolatti heavenly.",5
"Food was good - fusilli + octopus/marrow was delicious (highly recommended). The rice in the lobster risotto was really hard and way too crunchy. We waited 20 minutes past our original reservation time to be seated, with no one apologizing, caring, or thanking us for waiting. Service was slow, lackluster, and inattentive. Maybe we caught them at an off night - the first time I went it was magical. They also no longer have Ricci on the menu.",5
FANTASTIC RESTAURANT! Michelin stars at an affordable price!,5
"Todo fue muy bueno, excelente el personal y el chef !!!",1
"Amazing from start to finish! We went to Marea to celebrate my birthday. We selected the 4-course pre fixe menu; unlike pre-fixe menus at other restaurants, you pretty much have free range to select from anything on the regular menu. If you choose a pasta dish, they will give a you a half portion (which is more than enough - believe me!). Of note were the fusilli from the pasta menu and the scallops from the pesce and carne menu. Honestly, there was not a single thing that we had that wasn't delicious. To top it off, the service was personable and impeccable - a truly memorable experience. Highly recommended!!",4
"Starting with service, it was horrendous. The wait staff were inconsiderate, did not attend to us appropriately. Our waiter conned us into getting the tasting menu and said it was$109 per person. He FAILED to tell us that the items he recommended for us ALL HAD A SURCHARGE, and when asked about it at the end of the dinner, he said it was listed on the menu that there was a surcharge. What a fail for the restaurant.  The food was nothing out of the ordinary. DEFINITELY NOT Michelin Rated 2 stars kind of place.  I have been to many Michelin rated places, this place does not deserve 2 stars for its food, ambiance or service.  Go to Scarpetta if you desire Italian food that tastes 100 times better.",5
"The food and service were very good but not outstanding. For a restaurant that has been so highly reviewed and it was so difficult to get reservation, I was underwhelmed.",5
"Excellent food, very attentive staff, yummy cocktails!",4
Excellent restaurant! Food is amazing! Service top notch!,5
"I've been to Marea few times before.  This evening, however, the food wasn't as good as I recalled.",5
It was a nice two course lunch set. The pasta is the best!!! Creamy and very tasty! Can't get anywhere else,5
Superb two course lunch special is a great value. Gracious staff in a beautiful room at a convenient location. I'll be back!,4
Este lugar es extraordinariamente bueno se lo recomendare a todos mis amigos.,5
Excellent food. Reasonable  but expensive. Wine list is rediculously expensive.,4
"Food was very original , quality above the charts, Service was excellent and we had 2 children under 6 dining with us. Overall a great place for celebrating a special occasion.",5
The food was fresh and well  cooked but the service could be brisker and more attentive.  Nevertheless the seafood is great!  Dover sole and grilled octopus were perfect!,4
Another amazing dining experience!!!,5
The servers were talking to each other about me and my boyfriend and were unprofessional.,5
Estupenda comida.,2
Servicio eficiente y amable.,5
Visiting NYC and staying nearby. Picked this restaurant out of the blue and mostly for location. It was a very pleasant surprise.,5
It was so so restaurant,5
Some guests were just t shirts ,5
Not top just average,5
I will most certainly return to Quality Italian for it's great food and gracious hospitality. We ordered a wonderful Amarone from their excellent,5
"wine list. Our group shared the Beefsteak Tomato & Straciatella Salad. Our group also shared the unique Chicken Parmigiana for two, and the Veal Chop Milanese sprinkled with pickled peppers and mozzarella. The whole meal was fantastic. They treated us Opera Buffs from Washington DC like family.",5
"I've been here a few times now, always for lunch. The food has always been very good, bordering on exceptional. The crudo is great, especially the scallop carpaccio. The several chopped salads with your choice of protein are perfect lunch dishes (of course the pepper seared filet is awesome). And as primarily a steakhouse, the meats are expectedly luscious albeit pricey. Which brings me to my only conflicted comment. There are only three pastas and they are amazing. There are Italian influences throughout the menu but the only wholeheartedly Italian dishes are the pastas and that part of the menu is really sparse. With Quality Meats just around the corner, Quality Italian, in my opinion, needs a few more pastas to cement its identity.",5
Wonderful find to take clients to lunch.  One server was falling behind and another jumped right in and made the service amazing!  The food was fantastic and uniquely presented.  Worth every dollar spent!,5
"I took clients here, we had a large table of people but the waitstaff handled it deftly. ",4
"The food was  incredible, from the monkey bread at the beginning to the ""Dressed up"" gelato at the end. In between we made stops at seafood tower (the oysters were to die for), the eggplant parm ""meatballs"", the branzino (one of my clients got this and declared it to be the best he had ever consumed), and the fra diavlo Lobster rolls with tuscan fries (enough said).",3
"i would highly recommend this to anyone who loves food and would recommend for a romantic lunch or dinner, request the table behind the ""57"" window, you feel like you temporarily own a piece of the city.",5
This is my third time to QI and I've had a great meal each time. The ricotta gelato is absolutely out of this world and I recommend it to anyone who goes there. My steak was a little on the rare side for my liking but otherwise perfectly cooked. Fun scene and beautiful atmosphere.,4
"We live in the neighborhood and had trouble getting a reservation so we were really looking forward to a great dining experience. The room was beautiful, the crowd was energetic and the wait staff was attentive. Unfortunately, the food was a huge disappointment.  Their signature chicken parm pizza was creative, but tasteless and heavy, and our salad was swimming in dressing. With so many great Italian restaurants in the city, we will not be returning to this one.",5
"Quality Italian ended up being the best money I have ever spent on dining. From the second we walked in  and was offered coat check, to the second we left, everything was excellent. The food was delicious, and service was great.  The food runners explained everything about the meal, and was extremely accommodating.  I was either smiling or eating the entire time. ",3
"Not sure if worth all the effort to get a reservations. Getting table too much of a hassle. But decent food, service.",5
"I am so glad I picked this restaurant for my daughter' birthday.  The waiter was wonderful and gave us a complimentary side dish and dessert because it was her birthday, without even asking, with a candle.  Our waiter was so helpful since this was our first visit.  We would definitely go back.  He even told us in advance how to heat up leftovers if we had any.  The chicken parm pizza, their signature dish, was amazing.  We had the special zeppole dessert.  That was fun, it had 4 different toppings with it.  We really enjoyed ourselves.  ",5
"For the price level,Nothing special about the restaurant. I think food options are quite limited in the menu. And quite mediocre food. I can only recommend this restaurant for drinks and people watching",4
"We went to Quality Italian for my boyfriend's birthday and had a great time.  The staff was friendly and attentive, the food was absolutely amazing, and we had a really fun night.  They even put a candle in his gelato and gave us two complimentary glasses of preseco.  Overall it was a great experience and made for a very memorable evening.",3
"Tuesday was my one year anniversary with my boyfriend. I've had my eye on Quality Italian's chicken parm pizza looking amazing dish for quite some time so I decided it'd be perfect to celebrate. I made a res on OpenTable and in the comments section I wrote ""we're celebrating our anniversary so if you have a nicer table that'd be nice!"" not thinking anything of it. Upon arrival, our waitress, Sam, came out with complimentary prosecco and wished us a happy anniversary! I would have never thought they'd actually read my comment let alone do anything about it. The rest of dinner was wonderful and to top it off, Sam brought out a cannoli to share on the house and wished us a happy anniversary again! It was such a lovely evening. Thank you Sam!! ",4
"We keep going to this spot to celebrate special occasions; birthdays, anniversaries, graduations.  Staff, ambiance, food, and location all great!",5
Del Frisco's never disappoints!  We went before a show and it was great!,5
Outstanding dry aged steak and crab cake appetizer. Their services and atmosphere were great as well.,5
"Couldn’t have asked for a better experience. The service was splendid and the food was heaven,  worth every penny. I definitely recommend this restaurant for anniversary or for any special occasions. Best steak I’ve eaten in my life.",5
Celebrated anniversary here. Great evening.,5
Food was delicious. Wait staff was very courteous and attentive. Overall great experience.,5
"Great for for steaks.  If you want to avoid the very energetic noise level, ask for the back room upstairs, much quieter indeed.",5
Great all around experience from beginning to end. Exactly what I would expect from Del Frisco’s,5
"Absolutely love this place, 10 yrs of special occasion dining that have never disappointed.",5
To expensive for what you receive,3
"Ambience it is ok, but noisy",5
"Amazing wagyu tomahawk steak, attentive service, fine wine and a evening to remember.  Everything in here is quality and fine dining....will definitely return soon.",5
"Pretty good dry aged rib eye,",3
 Filet mignon  was a disappointment !,5
"Hermoso lugar, ubicacion inmejorable con vista a la 6a Av, la comida muy buena y el servicio excelente.",4
Tomohawk is Amazing,2
This is a great place for steak with excellent side dishes. Look forward to go back again when I am back in NYC.,4
Service was excellent until Matre D asked us to free up the table since we weren’t having desert. Rediculous given a $425 dinner bill for two after 1.5 hour meal.  Quite disappointing.  Not a good meeting place for business dinner.,4
Terrific as usual.,4
Beautiful restaurant ... the staff are very professional,5
We actually eat The for business meals often and the one thing that we consistently get a bit agrevated about is the steak temp. You have to order one up on the temp or you likely will send it back.. happens every visit as someone does not want to ruin a good steak by having it over cooked. Sounds picky I know and the steaks are really good!,5
"Dined here many times in the past 4 years.  I am from the west coast - do business in NYC regularly;  if there one locale I AWAYS visit - it is Del Frisco’s.  Although a bit noisy, it is consistently top-notch service and food.  Fantastic electric atmosphere.  As a former Navy fighter pilot and test pilot - this place is clearly a ‘cut above’.",5
"As always great food. We were running late and lost our original table reservation but the hostess got us another table as soon as we got there, she was very understanding. Thank you!",5
A good spot for pre-show dinner or cocktails. Ranges on the higher end of the spectrum but our food was good and the staff very nice,5
excellent meal and the service was awesome. Liz was terrific!,4
Great place for business gathering for its greate services and great foods (both seafood and steak) !,3
Very solid lunch specials. Nice salad and sliced steak.,5
Excellent place for steak.  Very nice surroundings and a number of good choices on the menu for meat eaters and vegetarians alike.  Nice bright surroundings - huge windows downstairs.  Friendly service.,5
It was a nice place to celebrate the NYC MARARTHON 2017!!!!,3
"The staff at Del Friscos was superb.  Great recommendations, greeted my companions who ran the NY marathon and had a congratulatory card for them waiting on the table.",5
"Slow service, greasy onion rings, crab cakes are good but get the same ones from any supermarket for 1/3 of the price.  The best was the jelly beans and the champagne.",5
"Another fine dining experience. When we come to NYC we like to schedule at least one meal here. We know it's going to be busy, somewhat noisy and crowded but the service and food is worth any minor inconvenience. We also enjoy Del Frisco's in Las Vegas and Santa Monca.",5
"This place is in my top 5 in my life both domestic as well as international. Great service, great food. Will return on my next visit to NY.",5
Dinner was awesome and wife’s birthday was great  ! Our server Liz was also awesome ! Great steakhouse !,5
"The service was excellent, probably the best service I've ever had. The food was good but I was not super impressed. I had the tomahawk wagyu rib eye and it was great.. Except I've had cheaper and better steak elsewhere. The sides were on point, specifically the mashed potato.",5
Had a great night out with Family.Food and service Excellent.,5
Took daughter to NYC for first time to see a play.  Dinner here made the night that much more special! The atmosphere is electric. The view is fantastic. They made my 9 year old feel special in a mostly adult restaurant. Loved it.,5
"The food was very good. The service was pretty good, we had a large party and there were a few minor issues with the orders but nothing terrible. Our party was very happy.",4
"This is the third time I have been to DelFrisco's, the first 2 were for dinner, the most recent was for lunch to celebrate my birthday.  We had the pleasure of having Carson for our waiter, which was the second time for that, and he is someone who goes more than out of his way to make sure you are enjoying your meal, not to mention sending a thank you card to our home after dining there for the first time.  The food is amazing and explained exactly as it comes out, and the bonus was dessert which we did not even have to order, and was brought out to us just because we were celebrating a birthday.  Would definitely recommend and look forward to going back again in the near future.  Wonderful restaurant!",5
"I have eaten at many, many steak houses over the years, and the steak served at STK was as good as any I can remember. Cooked perfectly, no fat, great texture and taste, with a steak sauce to dip into. The side dishes and salads were terrific as well. Worth every penny !",5
Nice area of town to have a great dinner. A bit of a challenge to get a reservation but triggered an opening via Open Table and all was good. We were seated at a nice table and were taken very good care of. The restaurant is extremely noisy. So you want to sit close to anyone you actually want to talk with during the meal. Wine was excellent.,5
"Good quality food. Great service. Food did not amaze me, but a good place for a work dinner. Good steak",5
Food and service was very good and would definitely go back.,4
"Great service, fantastic food and an awesome wine list to boot. Definitely heading back soon.....",5
Most enjoyable. Service was helpful and competent. Dishes wonderful as expected. Raw squid w/chili sauce world class. Worth the trip.,5
Loved the bar area. Nice cocktail list. Wine list was way over priced as were wines by the glass. You always expect a mark up but this was ridiculous. Food was very good. Meat was cooked perfectly and nice seasoning. Side sauces added rather than overwhelmed the beef. Truffle parm fries were different but in a good way. Definitely recommend the lobster Mac and Cheese.,3
The music was so loud we had to actually yell across the table to be heard. It was so loud the table and seats vibrated. It really detracted from the meal.,4
The waiter was absolutely obnoxious. I won't go back because of him. He was rude and condescending. We joked that he was previously a used car salesman.,4
First night in the city after moving from DC and was looking for a steak.,5
Pros - Food was absolutely amazing. Foie Gras and Beef Tartar appetizers were out of this world. Bone In Filet cooked perfectly and the mushrooms melted in our mouths.,4
"Cons - The bar was designed very awkwardly, making it difficult to sit there and have a meal. The bartender, while very personable and knowledgable regarding cocktails, did not know the menu very well.",4
"Great place for a meal with a bunch of people.  The salad was great, the bone in filet was melt in your mouth and the chicken Parm was just off the charts AWESOME!!!!  The Kale side dish was good but a little to mushy for my taste.  ",4
This place is a must go!!,5
"great food, great energy, although we were told they had a private event they did not  typical nyc restuant when they r ho. enjoy it while it lasts.............   we enjoyed the evening although they stuck us in a really bad table,  u have to know someone obviously to get a res and a decent table. ",4
"Everything about our dinning experience was fabulous! We tried to sample as many things on the menu as possible; and our choices didn't let us down. We were still talking about the chicken parm, baked clams, broccoli rabe, spinach, fries, and the fresh pasta dishes the next day. We even had steak to bring home and enjoyed it for breakfast with eggs 3 days later. What a feast!",4
Unique and energetic place. Food is above average and special,5
"I had a terrific time @ Quality Italian today. I had an out of town guest who is a life-long friend. I was SO glad to introduce him to this lovely space. Congrats! I understand you have only been open since last summer…we both enjoyed ourselves immensely and our server Ken was wonderful, as were the other staff. Food was excellent and the drinks even better.",5
I will be back very soon.,5
"Thanks again,",5
~Mark Hummel,4
"The food was on par with the top restaurants in it's class. Our server, John, was very personable and knowledgeable. Provided great recommendations to enable us to have a family style shared plate dinner for 3. Not too much and not too little. Did not try to push anything to us. The pacing of the dinner service was just the right balance which allowed us to eat and chat at a comfortable pace. The one thing I would knock the restaurant for was the fact that the staff started rearranging furniture for the next day while we and a few other groups were still eating. For a restaurant of this caliber, I don't find that to be an acceptable practice. Perhaps this was because we were in the smaller side room instead of the main dining room.",4
My wife wanted to come here for her birthday. We had a terrific time.,5
"My friend and I went to Quality Italian for birthday celebrations.  I have eaten at Quality Meats, which was a great meal and Quality Italian proved to be the same quality and enjoyable dining.  The restaurant itself is has a modern Tuscan feel to it.  The staff was very helpful and knowledgable about everything on the menu.  The mixed cocktails were very nice and had a wonderful Pinot Noir.  I had a shrimp dish and baked clams for appetizers.  They make the steak sauce fresh in front of you. For my entree,  I had the veal chop, which was superb and if you love steak, definitely get the Tomahawk cut.  They also have a really nice bar area for meet and greets and drinks with friend.",4
Highly recommend!,4
"Quality Italian is a great surprise. Their small plates are innovative and delicious as are their large plates of veal shank and Branzino. You can get Amarone by the glass and, to top it off, request JD Macon as your server because there's no-one like him. He will make sure your food choice is perfect and he is gracious and attentive and fun. To me, he is the face of this new eatery and accentuates it's vitality, and quality and reminds you how dynamic great dining can be. Pass this one up at your peril. The ambiance of the place is very spacious and artistic in a rustic kind of way. It feels right and it tastes right. And the value is all over the menu. How lucky can you get?",3
"Service here was brilliant, friendly and helpful yet not obtrusive. We were served by Frank and Peter. The atmosphere was bustling. We had the tomahawk and the veal chop, both were cooked to perfection and we could not fault either dish. We will definitely be back.",3
My sister and I went to NYC for 4 days and went to QI twice! We are both foodies and love to try new places but this was so awesome we had to go back!! Oysters ricci was to die for! They got this rest 100% on target from bread to service!!,3
"Every part of the meal was delicious! The bread was tasty, the kale tricolore salad was a nice start, the portherhouse agnolotti was delectable, and the lobster was in a phenomenal sauce. Oh, and leave room for dessert!",3
"Great drinks, great dinner.  Apps were good, nothing specific that was overly impressive.  I split a lamb bolognese pasta dish and a pork chop dish with my buddy.  Lamb bolognese, terrific and pork with cherry was also exceedingly good.  ",5
Second time there in one week. Wonderful food. Can't wait to go back.,4
Love quality meat and this is just as good! Atmosphere awesome and great with kids! Even let them help make the cannolis!,5
always outstanding .... thank you for always making us feel welcome,5
"Although we had a reservation for 8:45pm, we only sat at our table at 9:15pm. However, the hostess gave us a glass of champagne while we waited, and apologized a million times, which was nice. Once we sat down, the service was really good and the food delicious!",3
"Everything was just right: quality of food, service, pacing of service, ambiance.",4
As always great food and service,4
"Every detail of service and food was outstanding!! The menu is very creative, and oh, so delicious!! Mostly fish and sea food, but the poultry/meats are at another level of excellence.",5
the place to go in NY if you want fish & seafood with a wow factor,4
"This has to be the best meal we have ever enjoyed anywhere. From the ambience, to the service, to the food - it was all memorable. Though this restaurant is on the east coast and we live on the west coast, it would be worth a trip to eat here again. Words fail me here.",5
"Delicious and creative appetizers! It would have been a perfect experience but for what I consider an underhanded move by the restaurant when describing the branzino entree. The staff recommend it for two, but don't explain that the price is $49 per pound and that each fish ranges from between 1.5 and 3 pounds. So we ordered the branzino, and it came to $100 for two pounds, which was the entire fish. What we actually got was a lot less because the head, bones etc. are removed. And the description of the entree to us was not a fluke - we overheard the wait staff explain it the same way to the neighboring table. A bit disappointing.",4
Simply amazing. We had a bit of everything and all excellent. True to the ingredient! Thanks for the great dining experience. I can't wait to return.,5
"From the moment we arrived until we left the restaurant, Marea was sheer bliss. The food, the service and the surroundings were a true delight.",5
"I was pleased overall. The space is exceptional. The food is very good. My only complaint concerns the portions with some of the items on the menu. My husband and I each had the $38 prix fixe lunch, which includes an appetizer and an entree. The portions on what my husband ordered were more than adequate, while mine were on the skimpy side (calamari/John Dory). I am not a big eater and normally in restaurants my complaint is the opposite - portions are too big - so that is saying something. In a neighborhood rife with restaurants where I can get decent portions of exceptional food for the same or even less in terms of cost (such as A Voce Columbus, just down the street) I would have to think twice before returning.",4
Seating was bad -- next to the servers' silverware drawer.,2
"The service was nothing short of insulting. Some dishes were good, others not so good.",4
"One comment re the view - if you are facing Central Park during the day, you do not see the park! All you see are buses stopping directly in front of the windows and people rushing by. Not very relaxing.",4
Positive comment - the tables are far enough apart that you can talk among your group and not listen to the diners next to you!,4
Fantastic pasta!,4
"Fantastic seafood. Power-lunch scene. Very much enjoyed both food and the scene. Best seafood restaurant in NYC right now. Service varied. Could be tighter in terms of training. Already a very high level, but could be improved. Food is hands down. Already planning a return. Took client, who was thrilled. Ran into several people I knew. Feel the buzz!",4
Great lunch menu. The spaghetti and the wine that our server recommended for the spaghetti was superb.,4
"First time dining at Marea, and the food lived up to the billing, it was outstanding!! The pasta courses were particularly incredible. The service started off very good, however, a strange thing happened. We had one waiter exclusively the first 2 or 3 courses, but then he dissapeared. There was a long wait prior to ordering the dessert course and we needed to flag someone down to get menus. After that we never saw our waiter again, not just at our table, but no where at all in the restaurant. Also, the table was relatviely uncomfortable. They put our group of three in a table that is really meant for two.",4
"Lovely restaurant with very good food. For the price, the service was a touch off.",4
We wanted the tasting menu and we politely discouraged from ordering it. We have a birthday club and take ourselves to the BEST restaurants and like to have tasting menus.,5
I had trouble understanding the servers when the announced the dish -- spoke too quickly and many had strong accent.,5
It was a birthday and a bit surprised that we didn't get an extra dessert (or something else more special than a candle).,2
it tastes like you are dining on the Amalfi coast but with a great view of Central Park. The best new restaurant in NYC,5
"Marea has been among the top of our list of favorite Manhattan restuarants. This week, the food was wonderful as usual, but I couldn't help feeling that management has stepped down service quality. e.g. At this level of restaurant, the servers shouldn't be confused about who ordered what - servers were confused in each our 4 courses, and we had only 4 people at our table. Additionally, at each course, the server would say, ""ok guys, here is..."" - which is fine for your local burger or burito joint, but not at a place like this. For the cheese course, which is ""a choice of 3 cheeses"" the waitress simply took the order and ran - no description of what was available. We'll try again - hopefully, this week was an anomaly.",5
"Marea was very nice. Very friendly and courteous staff, service was excellent. Food was well prepared, but not sure it was worth the price. Expensive, but the atmosphere is very nice, not too noisy, food is good, but not great.",4
"Fabulous! Top notch service, beautiful sea-farer's menu, gorgeous digs.",2
"We had a late night reservation, and had to wait about 20 minutes past that time, mainly because we had an extra person with us that we had not reserved for. We had tried to telephone them of the change, but the phone lines were busy all day. Nevertheless, the Maitre'D was very aware of the fact that we were waiting to be seated and kept us in the loop. What could have been a difficult situation was handled expertly.",3
"This is a beautiful bar/restaurant and an interesting-seeming menu. Everyone at our table ordered the prix fixe so we were able to sample a number of items. Nothing seemed excellent or even unusual, and that was difficult to understand given the great reviews.",5
"We went here to celebrate my birthday and had a wonderful time. The prix fixed menu allowed us to chose almost anything on the menu and everything was very tasty. The service was attentive yet not intrusive. We were not rushed through the four course meal, which I truly appreciate. Definitely would return.",3
"Been here 4 times and everything we'be had has been great. Plus, the sommelier is excellent.",4
"Excellent dining experience. The pasta with wild mushrooms & snails was cooked to perfection with a heavelnly sauce. The fish was fresh and fantastic selections. Scallops were also perfect with a delicate and delicious sauce. Excellent varied menu. The only disappointment were the oysters. 5 of the six were bland & tasted the same. Pasta choices--great vaiety and if not ordering the prixe fixe menu, I suggest 2 share a pasta as well as one of the antipasti. Portions are ample.",5
"The service, provided by a previous employee of Eleven Madison Park,was the only pleasantry in this over crowded over done show spot for the rich and ""want to be Famous!""One cannot seriously complain about the taste of the food, but only about about the miniscule ,""almost not enough to garner the taste,"" portions. The omnipresence of the bread girl offering her almost stale bread should give a hint to the size of the forthcoming portions. The fish teamed with brussel sprouts meant two baby brussel sprouts the size of a twenty-five cent piece with a small dollop of sauce which would easily fit on an infant spoon and a piece of fish measuring less that 1/2 of my watch band. The only thing large was the check.",5
"Marea's success may also lead to Marea's downfall. The bar is 3 deep with most folks in chairs eating at the bar while a couple sharing a bottle of bubbly had to reach in 3 tiers to obtain their glasses. The antipasti menu needs some reading as most offerings are a bit esoteric, pastas excellent, fish entrees prime. You then are rushed from your table so that some of the milling crowds can be accomodated. An 89$ prix fix plus cocktails, wine & gratuities should be a fine dining experience which didn't seem possible here on week night.",4
Delicious food and impeccable service. Would return here in a secnod.,5
"And what's up with the DJ? If you want a loud, hip place with a DJ - great....just make sure he plays better music.",2
"Overall, the food and drink, which is what we went for was amazing. The ambience though would probably prevent us from returning.",5
"Our server Jen was great from the start. Informative engaging and pleasant. Dinner, was very good but very $$$$. Not that we were surprised though the menu posted on line is cheaper by a few dollars so needs updating.The shortrib was perfect and at $32 reasonable. The 10oz filet was good and though priced higher than most steakhouses, expected. What i cant get past is $14 & $15 price tags for salads nothing fancy, salads. Drink prices were also off the charts when the bill came, two house margaritas were $36 im glad we didnt have a third. A glass of sangria for $16? Someone needs to check themselves! Though we loved the music played, it was unecessary and way too loud.",4
"Great food, excellent service. Good mid-town location for a consistently good meal.",5
great location and amazing design. A much more modern steak restaurant than most in New york.,2
Very good food and great bar scene. Extremely loud!!! For having a conversation or doing business dinner. If you want a place to hang out is perfect.,3
"I've had dinner at the Vegas location several times and is much better on all levels except decor and seating on time. The midtown food was good and service fine, but over priced. The Vegas location has better specials, more energetic servers, better ambience and DJ. The mgmt should try and infuse that same energy into midtown on a Saturday night at 10pm which is when we went thinking we'd eat and stay for drinks. We left right after dinner.",4
"The food and service at STK was phenomenal. If you are looking for a fun vibe (great music with a DJ) with delicious food and service, STK is your best bet. The Birthday Cake dessert is a must.",3
"I am a New Yorker, a recent Ex-vegetarian and was hosting my boyfriend for his birthday along with two guests from 'the middle of nothing'PA.",5
"We were all first timers to the restaurant but with our excellent waiter Forrest our evening was great! He was helpful with questions on portion size and cuts of meat. I asked him on the side to charge my credit card at the end and bring a slice of the birthday cake, he took our photo and told us to add it on Instagram for a glass of preseco.",5
"Thank you to the chef that cooked my steak well done (a sin, I know), it was delicious and full of flavor for this new meat eater.",1
STK was highly recommended by a friend and now I will highly recommend it to everyone!,4
Really delicious ... we had a wonderful time and even made friends with our dining neighbors. Great meal before a show!,3
STK in Vegas was so much better. My dessert here in Midtown was awful. My asparagus was great though and my steak was good,2
This place was lovely and the food was alson good.,5
"The negative point was the noise. In fact, the music was to loud to eat.",3
Such a great place in Midtown area. Ask for the wild mushrooms and enjoy your favorite cut of meat with a glass of wine (or bottle!).,1
Bon Appetit!,4
"Super expensive for good food. Not really worth it for the food, may be worth it for the scene. Beautiful restaurant for sure!",4
"Was on a 5-day NYC trip from Norway with my fiance for shopping, night life and a bit of relaxation. STK was on our short list of places to eat, after recommendation from a friend of ours.",5
"STK was a great experience, we very much enjoyed the design of the restaurant. With its modern trendy design, the atmosphere was also good. Trendy yet comfortable.",5
"The food was awesome, one of the best steaks i've ever had. The suggested red wine was a perfect match!",2
"I would call it a ""semi expensive"" restaurant, all in all we ended up at about $300 with three course menu with wine and drinks.",1
Well worth it!,2
Can definitely recommend to others.,4
4 people in our party and all 4 thought it was exceptional.,5
"I wanted to try STK for a long time. It LOOKS awesome. But stepping inside, you realize that it's the steak restaurant with an identity crisis. They have a DJ, but no dancefloor, and the MUSIC IS SO LOUD that you have to shout at the person sitting right across from you. I asked the server if it was always that loud, and he said yes, it's always this loud. Who thinks this is a good idea?? Also got a chicken dish and it was overkill on salt and sugar. Overall: Food was average, ambience was terrible, decor was nice, and overall unsatisfactory experience. If you're in midtown, suggest you try Frankie & Johnnie's Steakhouse or Landmarc instead. Both have better ambience and better food for similar pricing.",5
"Great decor and vibe, very lively! Bugers and sides were great. Steak mediocre.",4
"Ambience is fantastic. Food is good - not great. Probably would give it a higher score except was EXTREMELY put off by the ""grade pending"" sign in the window. Had I known that prior to arriving, we wouldn't have gone there. Paying $100pp is expected at a NYC steakhouse but you certainly don't want to spend the whole time wondering why they don't have an ""A"".",5
"The food and service is good. However, the noise level was extreme and deafening for a restaurant. The music played was terrible in the 1980's and is still bad today!! This is not a place to dine but is a pick up joint. I could not have a conversation with my relatives that I had not seen in years. The music was so loud that the vibrations could be felt on the seat chairs!! I was extremely dissapointed and embarassed that I had picked this restaurant.",3
"Amazing place, food is exceptional, DJ ROCKS!!!!",2
let down...the beet salad was lacking beets....and the small steak was non existant..... could not believe this was what everyone was talking about...,3
"A rude hostess said our table was ""being prepared"" and left us standing there for 10 minutes. 20 minutes after questioning her a second time (now 30 minutes) and being told once again ""your table is being prepared,"" we saw people leave and the staff push our table together. The hostess was rude and lied about our table. Wine by the glass choices are VERY limited. There is much more I could complain about but space in too limited. NYC has so many good places, why bother going to STK.",5
"It was my second time visit since the last spring right after they opened. Food was still good, but very disappointed by the service...so slow and rough. Took almost an hour to be taken the order. Every waiters kicked my chair whenever they went through behind me. Although I still feel that the food was one of the best in NY, not sure if I want to go back again.",5
"Marea is a first class place. Great location, great space, great food, excellent service. The only catch is that you better be in the mood for fish and seafood. Otherwise, go somewhere else. Only two items on the menu that are not seafood, and really no salads either.",4
"But, they do fish well and it is a wonderful restaurant experience. right on Central Park South on 59th, and a very nice wine list as well. Friendly place with a highly trained staff that knows what they are doing.",5
"Overall a keeper, you will not be disappointed.",3
the food is really good but quite expensive.,3
The atmosphere was very good and the bar area was nice. The appetizers were good but the entrees were disappointing. Not a glowing review for a steak house.,3
"It's more a bar than a restaurant, very loud DJ music, which makes conversation hard.",5
Nice spot though.,4
"The reservation was not honored until 35 minutes later. While the hostess were nice, this gave me a bad first impression. And the party before me waited for 45 minutes and eventually left.",3
"The service was lovely and the food was delicious here. The atmosphere and decor are whimsical but lovely. The fresh steak sauce made table-side was a nice touch, but the sauce was better with the parmesan fries than with the steak. Our porterhouse was slightly overcooked, but the meat was tender and delicious. We also received a tour of the private rooms upstairs and they are beautiful.",4
Air conditioning not working well; service a bit spotty; menu great but dishes were a bit flavorless.,3
A good steakhouse with a nice atmosphere. Not the best in NYC but good.,3
I try to go to Quality Meats every time I'm in NYC. I love it!,4
I enjoyed the lunch that I had previously as opposed to the dinner; Wonderful place to meet up with friends and associates.,4
Never disappointed at STK! Food and drinks are superb!,5
"Te food was amazing and the portion were perfect! That's the most important thing right? Te service was great, they even remembered to put a candle on my boyfriend's dessert even though I didn't tell them it was his birthday on the day of, I only put it on the comments section when I made the reservations. The only downside is that it was too loud. It's a big restaurant so they could try to contain the loud music towards the front bar only so that patrons who are looking for a more intimate experience are given that privilege.",1
Great place - awesome food and a vibrant scene perfect for groups or small tables alike,3
This is NOT a foodie spot. At most you want to stop here for drinks before a night out in the town. Music and people give it a good vibe. Food was blahhhhhhhhhh.,5
Just wasn't that good for the price. Miami location much better. Seated 3 at a table for 2 wouldn't go back.,5
I've been to both STK in Las Vegas and NYC-Midtown - both experiences were excellent. The atmosphere and food are top notch,4
Our sever was excellent have been to stk 3 times never disapointed,4
STK was recommended by a friend and it did not disappoint. The layout of the restuarant is quite nice with a bar in both the front and back entrance. The seating areas are situated in such a way that the bar scene does not negatively impact your,5
"dining experience. Food was really great, the steak was prepared to perfection. Fish was remarkable...kudos to the chef!! Service was friendly and attentive. I would definitely return.",2
We were there pre theater...around 7PM the music was cranked up to an unbelievable level. The soundtrack was awesome and we didn't mind but it might be just too loud for some. Food was very good and our server was attentive and very helpful. Incredible bar scene that one had to navigate with difficulty to get in and out of the dining area.,3
"great atmosphere, lively environment.",5
"Way overpriced food, with a steak I couldn't get my knife through!'",5
Great music..but too loud to talk to eighother,5
"The noise level was too high to have any real conversation at the table, the wine list was subpar and the prices were high. There are better steakhouses in NYC. With respect to the noise rating, I only choose ""Energetic"" because they do not have a rating for ""Too Loud""",5
STK is one of the best- always spot on for steak and the sides are delicious. Cocktails are creative and restaurant is trnedy.,4
"This was a great restaurant, once I found it. It's tucked into the Grace building -- but their website doesn't say that. Food was awesome. I've never had brussel sprouts that tasted that amazing. And the corn pudding is a must. Also -- loved the desserts. The birthday cake made me feel like a kid again -- so yummy. Service was really good and the ambiance very cool. Only drawback was the noise level. Very loud.",2
Great place we love it we live in Tampa and wish we have one,4
An altogether excellent experience. Spectacular modern decor. Available entree and side selections were varied and dishes were cooked to perfection. Service was friendly and prompt.,3
The ambiance was great. It is very cool and loungy.,5
STK is overpriced for the food quality. The bar scene was vibrant but the bar service was not so great.,4
"Go for the Scene, not the food. The Bar area is way overcrowded. The food is good & overpriced, but you go for the experience. My preference is the downtown location. Also the drink menus are different between downtown & uptown so I was kind of disappointed that there is no consistency between to the two STK locations.",3
"I took my fiance here for his birthday and as a steak lover his was not a favorite. I like my steak with a black crust and this was far from it. We got fries which looked good, but had no flavor at all and we also tried the mushrooms which were okay but nothing special. Nothing has topped BLT Prime for us yet.",5
My daughter and I absolutely loved STK! It was our first time there and will certainly be returning.,4
"Our overall experience was great for the most part at STK. Our food was very well cooked and tasted great. We went late at 10 30pm. Music was on point also, but only problem was our waitress. She was not attentive enough to our needs. We had to keep asking her to refill our water. Once our food came out she didn't come check on us until 15mins later. My bf needed sauce and had to wait that long due to her not coming back to check on us. Oh yes another thing, once again our waitress was gone for awhile. That when we were ready to go another person had to take our bill. And although we still tipped her 40 dollars she didn't even come to say thank you or thanks for coming to STK. Hopefully this only happened because it was late at night. But I",4
"Our waitress was awesome!!! She made all the difference, great personality, recommended a great Merlot from dinner. She was awesome (wish I can find the receipt so I could give her the proper credit)..",4
"Great spot in midtown. The ambiance was modern, not your typical steakhouse. The bar was popping, alot of conversation, good vibe. Our table was great, along the windows, kind of close to the next table but they were social people so it was ok. DJ played awesome music! Would have stayed longer just for the tunes! Service was phenomenal, food was fantastic. Can't think of anything to critique! Definitely pricey for dinner, but not privey for a good steak.",5
Great spot! Very good food and a bit more happening than the typical NYC steakhouse. DJ was spot on!,4
"STK has a good vibe. Attractive and comfortable space and a good looking and helpful staff. This is not the best steakhouse in town, but it probably does not need to be. Food (I had the shortrib) was pretty good but not great. Service started out a bit sluggish, but our server became very attentive about mid- meal. All in all, an enjoyable place for dinner with a group of friends. Will return.",5
"Was great, except my Rib Eye was over cooked. Sent it back. It came back just right.",5
"The food was amazing , we were party of 3 and all of us enjoyed their meal.",5
STK midtown was easy to find and a nice location for a dinner out for 2. sTK atmosphere was quiet and romantic. Service was good and prompt. Dinner was delicious,5
"The food is fantastic and of course I had the Filet Mignon which was cooked to perfection. The service is great and there was a DJ playing some great music. THe place has a high ceiling and great acoustics. I love wine and they have a lot of it, though expensive. I love this place.",4
Really nice steak restaurant. Good wine and cocktail list and comfortable booths for maximum conversation during meals. Would definitely recommend and revisit.,2
"My Husband and I know about STK because a friend from Brasil told us and recomended. So, the place is really wonderfull and we loved. Best steak in NY !! Beautifull people, and vibrant bar scene !!Very good music. We recomend, it's the experience in NYC !We are going to recomend for our friends from Brasil.",3
Had a wonderful meal and will definitely be revisiting stk when in las Vegas in 2 weeks!,2
"My wife had made a reservation and we had our 5 month old daughter in a stroller. Though the restaurant was lively, the staff was super accommodating. They seated us in a quieter part of the restaurant and all the waitstaff met all of our needs.",3
"this restaurant was totally incredible. the bar staff was a little cold, so we were nervous to be seated, but from that moment on, the service was impeccable. we were a party of 4, so we ordered a good variety of food and all of it was perfect! there was a chopped salad that had all of my favorite things, and the corn creme brulee was heavenly!!",5
definitley a great place to go!,4
Had to wait 45 minutes to get a table even though we had reservations.,3
Food was good (not great). Average dining experience - nothing unique. Server was not attentive.,3
"We went for restaurant week. We had to wait close to 40 minutes after our reservation time before being seated. Our waiter was mediocre at best, and the place was really noisy. I was sure I would never return-and then we got the food. OMG! We'll be back. I just wish they would have better service and a quieter ambience.",1
"Restaurant week dishes were OK, but waiters removed my table cloth when I left the table for 2 minutes to go to the bathroom, thinking that I had left the restaurant without paying. This seemed to be somewhat indicative of the restaurant's attitude towards Restaurant Week clients - condescending and viewed as a nuisance rather than potential future customers deserving of excellent service.",5
Love the restaurant week menu! Great service & every dish was very delightful! Would definitely recommend it to others! Will be going back soon!,4
"Quality Meats has always been top of its game. The food is great, the ambience is wonderful, and the staff have always been helpful. I have been here numerous times before but this time I got to take in Restaurant Week and they did not disappoint. I have been to other so called top restaurants where they have treated everyone very poorly due to the deal; however I was treated with the same respect and service as if it was any other day. One of my favorites in all of NYC.",4
"I have had some amazing meals at QM, however I would not reccomend it for restaurant week. There are two kinds of restaurant week menus, Restaurants that try to wow you so you will want to come back, and restaurants that cut corners, and try to turn a profit on the volume they do that week. QM would be the latter. The RW menu was uninspiring, and did not propperly reflect the focus of QM which is STEAK. Skip this place during restaurant week, and go when you want to drop $150 a head for a Quality piece of Meat!",4
"What a change from the typical NY steakhouse! Quality Meats is quite unique in that the dining areas are spaced out on several tiers throughout the restaurant and the ambiance is very low key instead of the raucous rooms you find in most steakhouses. The service was very good, the amuse bouche sent to the table by the chef was a nice surprise. I had the ban seared scallops in corn showder for an appetizer and the sweetness of the scallops and the corn were a perfect match. I opted for the hanger steak as my entree and it was so full of flavor and cooked perfectly. The ice creams offered for desert were also quite delicious.",4
"There where only 2 things I did not like about this place: The tables that were too close for comfort, and the less than delicious steak frites. Other than that, lovely.",4
The fixed price lunch menu was under $30 for 3 excellent courses,4
"Phenomenal homemade ice creams are a wonderful end to a fitting meal of expertly prepared meats and sides. Of particular note, the creamy gnocchi topped with bread crumbs and lightly baked to a crisp on top and smooth, gooey center.",4
"Much higher quality than expected, well done! Friendly service, good wine and a fantastic steak!",4
Good food and service! Very attentive wait staff.,4
"We went to Quality Meats during restaurant week and had a very pleasant experience. We arrived a bit early and we were directed to a comfortable seating area until our table was ready. We were seated upstairs and the tables, while dressed beautifully, were entirely too close together. The food was great though. I ordered the baby back ribs which were were glazed in a delicious slightly sweet glaze and the meat was literally falling off the bone. I ordered the pomegranite sorbet for desert and it was simply divine. I was highly impressed and wish that the regular menu wasn't so expensive!",5
"Outstanding food and service. Corn suffle is a must, so is the in-house made ice-cream the only downside is the noise level.",4
"we had a great experience here, staff was super friendly and the food was very good. i recommend the ribs. delish.",4
"Sides are small but very good. The steak was delicious. Love that they made the steak sauce in front of us. Wine list is fantastic. And the waiter was soooo friendly (a rare find in this city)! I was very pleased, as alway.",5
"On our recent trip to NYC, we wanted a great steakhouse experience - without traveling to Brooklyn to Peter Luger's. We found it - at Quality Meats. However, the funny thing is, the meat itself was the one thing that, while great, wasn't super memorable.",3
"The restaureant is very nice, with a great bar, and the wait staff was fantastic. The Sommelier spotted us loooking over Merlots, and immediately made a great suggestion for us, and reduced the price. It was a good find. The side dishes were unbelievable, and we had trouble deciding which to get. We settled on 3 - the corn creme brulee, the porcini mushroom fries, and the spinach. All were perfect - and the ribeye & veal chop were very good. It's our new NYC steakhouse!",4
"The Restaurant Week menu was very good, good service, but too loud with tables much too close to each other, and the restaurant was too dark to be comfortable.",3
"Food in original menu is amazing. The restaurant week menu was a little bit disappointing in that it had no real steak, only hanger and skirt. Overall was good, and they have an excellent wine list!",5
"It's too transparent the way waiters try so hard to steer you away from the restaurant week menu...which by the way, is very good. Attractive decor and delicious food make Quality Meats a great place to entertain or celebrate birthdays. (The hanger steak was a little tough this time but maybe it was just my cut of beef.)",4
"One of the best ""restaurant week"" menus I've ever had (I hate admitting that's what it took to get me in there!) Ribs, scallops and bread were outstanding! Great service. Will definitely be back.",3
"scallops and meat dishes were great. dessert a bit of a disappointment, with only ice cream/sorbet.",4
"Good food, clumsy but friendly staff, but no-one with any personality. Tables are too close to each other (I know this is NYC, but still). The Restaurant Week Menu looked promising. The 'Tomato Soup with Grilled Cheese Croutons' and the 'Baby Back Ribs with Basil & Mint' were absolutely delicious. I found the prices of the suggested wines to go along with the Restaurant Week Menu ($30.00 per glass) outrageous. Out of protest I went for a bottle of beer, which nobody seemd to mind.",4
"The steak tartare was very good as was the hangar steak. The sides were underwhelming and they push ordering extra sidea a bit by saying the sides that come with it are so small, but they are a full portion and this is just an upsell. I like the hand spun ice creams for dessert.",4
"This place in upper midtown is jumping at night. I thought that midweek at 8:00pm it would be quieter, but heck no, the atmosphere was abuzz with 20 and 30-somethings that took over the place and the bar area and gave it a great frenetic ambiance. We had the restaurant week menu which was very very good. We began with diver scallops that were succulent and beautifully presented and for our meal we had a lobster salad which was surprisingly plentiful, eclectic and delicious! Dessert was their chocolate rum & raisin ice cream on a cookie/brownie, with real rum in it of course. Service was friendly and brisk and the atmosphere was great. A very very good deal during restaurant week, but I would certainly retain and order off the main menu also",5
"A friend had highly recommended Quality Meats, so I jumped on the chance to dine there during Summer Restaurant Week. Although some places rush you through RW dining, I never felt that way here. In fact, the waiter took his time walking us through the menu & give us his recommendations.",4
The design of the restaurant is really great - a bit dark & romantic with various butcher tools hanging on the walls in a funky way. I didn't feel like we were in a typical boys' club steakhouse which I appreciated.,5
"The food was equally good. My boyfriend & I couldn't resist 2 helpings of the yummy bread. We also had the tomato soup(amazing croutons!),caesar salad, ribs,hanger steak, crispy potatoes (yum!)& ice cream too. A feast for $35/pp!",3
..WE LOVED it!!!!Food was delicious and creative without trying too hard.,5
"The service was truly exceptional. Also, we had gluten issues and not only did the chef adjust / accommodate for it, the waiter was exteremely helpful in navigating through the menu.",4
"Some of the meat was overcooked and the restaurant was out of a lot of things on the menu. Otherwise, a good dining experience.",3
Food was very good but the place was noisy. You can hardly hear a person two feet from you.,3
"Outstanding service, wonderful presentation, enjoyable experience.",5
My only complaint is the name. At first I thought it was a meat store not a restaurant. Their corn creme brulee is out of this world. They have the most pure crab cake I have ever eaten. They have no detectable filler. Maybe it's held together with glue.,4
"I took my husband here for his 40th birthday. He LOVED it - the food, service, and ambience were all great! It was our first visit, and it's now definitely at the top of our steak places list. I mentioned on the open table reservation that it was my husband's birthday, and we got complimentary prosecco AND they comped the dessert he ordered and put a little birthday message in chocolate sauce on the dessert plate. The service was super-friendly from the moment we walked in the door, and the steak and sides were delicious. Loved the bubble and squeak, and the gnocchi and cheese were great. Will DEFINITELY be back!!!",5
"We visited Quality Meats following recommendation from a friend while on a one night stay, from the UK, in New York prior to joining a cruise ship.",4
"It was everything we expected and hoped for-excellent steaks, first class service and a lively atmosphere.",5
I appreciate that the tipping culture is somewhat different between the UK and the US however the evening was marred somewhat when upon leaving the premises we were stopped (by the Manager I assume) to ask why we had not left a tip. It was true that no gratuity has been added to the credit card payment however I had provided a fairly generous tip to the waiter personally and in cash as is my normal practice. Some simple checking with the waiter would have avoided the incident.,3
Amazing dining experience! Great service and wonderfull food!Makes us want to come back to New-York just to come and have diner at Quality Meats!,4
"The seafood tower appeatizer was great as were all the sides and dessert. We were disappointed by the preparation of the beef, two in the party had requested medium rare and both were over cooked. Also, more first Vodka Soda was flat, though the brought me a new one. The cuts of beef were very tender but the preparation left the meat meat a bit dry for my tastes.",4
Everything about the restaurant was top notch except the bread and the size of the fish portions.,5
"The service was excellent - helpful, cheerful, funny, and attentive without being overbearing. Food was great as well - I highly recommend the broccoli cheese turnover.",4
"For the first time in a very long time we felt the food lived up to -- and surpassed -- its price and hype. In the end, food is about the quality of its ingredients and everything -- from the bread to the sides to the main courses -- was delightfully fresh, flavorful and rewarding. The staff was friendly and accommodating. Right now, Quality Meats has moved to the top of our list.",4
Great spot. My new favorite steak house -- don't know why it took me so long to go here. The meat is unbelievable -- cooked perfectly. The sides are truly unique.,5
"My Husband and I had a very romantic evening, the food",4
"was very good, my husbands steak was a little salty which he called the waiter",4
over and took it back and brought him one less salty . Very amicable,5
and we loved whole eveing.,3
"Overall, our experience was excellent and the steak was fantastic. The crab cake was not as tasty, but everything else was wonderful.",3
"The waiter was very nice but put too much pressure on us to leave at the end. Always with a smile, mind you, but bringing us the check without us asking for it, and then the repeated ""we hope you had a good dinner with"" and then ""we wish you a good evening"" etc... were too much.",5
appetizers and sides outshine the excellent steaks,5
"I've been to Quality Meats many times and have never had a bad experience. In fact, it seems to keep getting better each and every time I go. It was truly a wonderful experience.",5
"The food was excellent as always. Service was less attentive than usual, which was a surprise in view of past experiences here. The noise level was exceedingly high, which is my only real complaint about this restaurant. My guests and I strained to hear one another speak. My regret, after many visits to Quality Meats, is that this restaurant is ideal for the under 40 crowd, but not the over 50 crowd, strictly from a noise level standpoint. You may consider this as just one old fogey's opinion.",3
"Quality Meats is best after 10pm . . . trust me, you can walk in without a reservation and get the best table and pretty much on any night - I have done it on several occasions. This time, with a reservation at 9pm, the experience was frustrating and the food was subpar. For our bad luck, we were seated at the back and had to wait for 20mins before getting a menu. But then the service improved significantly, so they earned their tip. The food however was a lackluster and undercooked to our request, which was even noticed by the server. The atmosphere is usually loud and tables are in close proximity, but that is the ambience of Q. Meats. Thus it was so, so . . . and that is Quality Meats in my opinion . . . so, so.",3
I am extremely picky eater and the food here was wonderful. I would recommend it to anyone who wants some where to eat in NY.,4
Thank you for the memorable experience,4
"Service was excellent, and foods are also outstanding. I would like to visit again.",2
"Always good! Very reliable! Great service & atmosphere. I would recommend requesting the downstairs dining room, definitely more ""local.""",5
not worth the prices they charge......porterhouse for 2 was only OK......sides were very good.......salads were not......,3
I was mildly disappointed by the entrees though the appetizers and most of the sides were very good. I ordered halibut which is usually a very flavorful fish that doesn't require much in the way of preparation or cooking. It was overcooked and a tad under-seasoned. My boyfriend ordered an entree which included three fillets prepared three different ways. It was very bland as well.,5
I was hoping for a moderately healthy meal and ordered the pan roasted sliced potatoes instead of the fries. They were drenched in oil and certainly equally caloric. Shame.,4
I will stick with Wolfgang's.,3
Excellent food. Very loud. If you want conversation friendly ask them to seat you upstairs. Wonderful location on 58th and easy to reach from anywhere in midtown.,2
Overpriced. Gave it a second try. Not as good as the first. Lobster ravioli special was not special and at the price...poor value. Probably go for the bar scene. Service was quite good and attentive....,4
Steak tartare was off the hook.,3
I came for Restaurant Week and had a wonderful time. The steak tartar is a must. You can really appreciate the quality of the ingredients that went into this large portioned appetizer. The ribs were very tasty and tender and can be consumed with knife and fork - although I've had other ribs that fell off the bone even more easily. The scallops and the steak were hits too. The ice creams were delicious and a nice and simple way to end the meal. They were rich/flavorful but didn't leave a thick coat on my palate. There were large portions at every course. Service was efficient yet I did not feel rushed. I will be back!,5
"Went during Restaurant Week. Possibly why the server was rude and rushed us. Either way, did not make for as romantic an evening as was planned. Food was good - not excellent.",4
"The steak is second to none and prepared exactly as requested. Also, the restaurant has the best sides. They are unique takes on standard veggies etc.",5
"Wait staff pleasant enough. They do their best to steer you away from the restaurant week menu - in fact they have only one menu card per table. When asked to get one for each memeber of the party of 4, they look at you as if you are stupid (with a look that says ' how does it matter - they are all the same') - finally one siad 'We have only as many as there are tables. Very insulting.",3
"Went for restaurant week. I still think this is the best steakhouse in Manhattan. It is always great. Wonderful food, great wine, attentive service, and a hopping bar. All the other steak houses seem old and stuffy in comparison.",4
"We really enjoyed our dining experience at Marea. The service was superb; the food was very good; however, the portions were small for the price of the meal.",4
"Overall, very very good.  Sides were excellent.  A very nice spin on the traditional steakhouses, with some very notable and differentiating features.  Probably better for a business dinner or a group of guys.  Women may find the ""dungeon atmosphere"" a little lacking.",4
"Seated right away at a table which we enjoyed.  The waiter Michael was very helpful in selection great choices.  He did not rush us as we did not have other plans that night.  Brought our food in a relaxed way.  Food was great, Well worth our time there.",5
The food was amazing and Joe our waiter was exceptional. Fish was very fresh and steaks were prepared perfectly. We had five sides including lobster mashed potatoes. These are enough for the 8 of us. The deserts were huge and the lemon cake could feed 4. My only criticism is like most modern designed restaurants the noise level is high.,5
"My girlfriend and I dined here for my 27th birthday and it was an amazing meal. This was our 3rd Michael White resturant that we have tried and all have been fantasic! We both had the prefix meal which was well worth the price. The spaghetti with crab and sea urchin was very good and my girlfreind absolutely loved the pesto ravoli. The highlight of my meal, however, was the wild striped bass, which was out of this world. Perfectly cooked, easily the best peice of fish that I have ever had. Our server was very good and attentive and gave us some good recommendations. Overall great experience!",4
"As an ""out-of-towner"" it was a great experience. Great food and movie stars across the room.",4
"The entire evening was delightful. The dining room is sleek and sophisticated... the banquettes and chairs comfortable ... the lighting flattering. Service was professional, attentive, not intrusive. The food was absolutely delicious and beautifully presented. Our server's suggestions for wine pairing with various courses was very good.",5
"We had heard great reviews from friends that had been at the restaurant so we chose it as our 1st wedding anniversary destination.Our experience was memorable. Having been to many high end restaurants, this one really stood out. We can rarely say that a dish is perfect and there were many at Marea.The sommeliere did an amazing job at advising my husband which is also a sommelier. He was very impressed by her service.Thank you very much for the impecable service and warm greeting...",5
"We are small people whodon't enjoy huge portions. These portions were really tiny for the price. The wine list is so overpriced. We had a wonderful experience the first visit, but it simply did not live up to expectations on this our second time. Our server was really adorable and warm.",4
"We dined late (11pm) on a Saturday. We loved the raw fish appetizers (clams and tuna belly), and the pastas (lobster ravioli, and braised octopus), but were less impressed with the secondi (striped bass). We would have been happier ordering more raw fish, trying an antipasti and skipping the secondi. We ordered wine by the glass, and it was fine, but not fantastic. Should have gotten a bottle for only a bit more. The service at the bar, and in the dining room was outstanding.",4
We had such an incredible experience at Marea. A great spot for a special occasion.,5
The food was delicious along with being different and memorable and the service was outstanding. The staff in not only friendly but very very helpful and knowledgeable.,5
We are planning on going back!,2
amazing food and experience from start to finish,4
"Considering all the hype & all the recent press (James Beard nomination, etc,) VERY underwhelmed. Menu looked very impressive but just didn't deliver. Crudo was just OK and left us craving a good sushi restaurant. Oysters were just fine but for my money a trip to an old standby like, say, Aquagrill, would have blown them away. Starters were ok too but the highlight was the pasta, which was VERY good to be fair. The closer, however, a $49 soup that they call the “bordetto di pesce” was such a waste of money I don't even know where to begin. Service was just ok but poor when you looked at the final bill, which was very midtown...as was the ambiance.",5
Was expecting A LOT more and Marea simply did not come through.,5
It's been awhile since I raved about my dining experience. And our waitress was fantastic and made us feel welcome during our first visit. I would call her a Marea ambassador instead of a waitress.,4
"Rather than outstanding I'd give this an excellent, but since excellent wasn't an option....of the 10 dishes ordered--the seafood risotto--was just ok, not sublime. Beautiful room. Very expensive wine list.",5
"ALTHOUGH QUITE EXPENSIVE, IT IS ONE OF THOSE DINING EXPERIENCES THAT IS WORTH EVERY DOLLAR. THE DECOR,THE SERVICE,THE BLESSED QUIET AND THE AMAZINGLY WONDERFUL FOOD ARE MEMORABLE!",5
"Ordered $86pp tasting menu, and it was excellent. Portions were on the smaller side (and we had to pay a supplement for beef entree), but we were stuffed nonetheless.",5
"The sommelier was not helpful. I advised a price range, and he consistently recommended wine bottles above my range. The wine we chose was above my planned spend, but the sommelier should have followed my lead and recommended the best of what was in my price range. He came across as condescending by saying that ""its hard to work with that range,"" although there were more than 15 bottles in and below my price range. Are those bottles not good? Bottom line: 2pp, tasting menu, bottle of wine, $325 inc tax and tip.",5
👎👎👎👎 way better options,1
the best so far-- it was a good scene,5
"Food is excellent. Their Chicken Salad is to die for. My only displeasure was when I had ordered individual beverages and was asked if I would like sparkling water or flat water (having ordered a club soda already)- prefering flat they brought over water. I later found out they charged me $11 for the bottled water? Which quite frankly had a flip top, suspiciously looks like it was refilled from the tap!",3
Love the extra long bone on the rib-eye.,4
"The food was absolutely wonderful.  Had read some bad reviews regarding service, but ended up being more embarassed by how fast the service was than disappointed about about waiting.  We had a 9 pm reservation for 2 and were walking out of the restaurant by 10:15pm.  Plan on coming back again for sure.",4
"It was mas first time causeI live in México, but I loved.",5
Wonderful,5
"Hey, my lady and  I had a good time at Quality Meats the food was amazing and the service was even better! One thing i would work on would be the dark closed closet lighting. it seemed a bit too dark for me even though we arrived at our 8:40 reservations it was still very dark and i almost took a spill down the stairs. other then that everything was amazing and i would go again perhaps maybe for lunch when sun is up and i can see what's in front of me. -javier",4
PS: The following morning I woke up dreaming of The Steak Tartar,2
The sommelier (or the person presented to be one) knew very little about wine.  Everyone's filet mignons were lukewarm.  The waitstaff was sloppy at pouring liquids and clumsy at placing plates.  The food quality was simply average.  Quality Meats is probably the worst premium steakhouse I've been to.,5
awesome as are all the stillman spots,4
A wonderful dinner.,4
"I mentioned in my open table reservation that it was my girlfriends birthday -- without saying anything to the wait-staff when I arrived -- they served us complimentary champagne and when dessert arrived it had the requisite candle and ""Happy Birthday"" spelled out in chocolate sauce. I was very impressed that the staff took note of the request and executed without having to be reminded. Our waiter was very personable and the service was excellent. I highly recommend the Green Goddess salad and the Sirloin was cooked to perfection - however, the 3 Filets which were tasty, were only served warm, not hot. Overall I would have no issues recommending Quality Meats as a great mid-town restaurant.",5
Seating was a little too close to other diners but that is also quite common in NYC.  Other than that it was an outstanding steakhouse that I will definitely be eating at again.,3
"A wonderful resturant, food and service is above par. Would go there again.",4
"I have a wheat allergy, which I always note when making a reservation. When we were seated, everyone of the staff involved with our table made mention of it, checked with the chef etc. This is not always my experience, even in the so called TOP restaurants in NYC. The food was excellent, the ambiance very interesting, a complete change from the former Manhattan Ocean Club. We will be going back, but wish it were quieter.",3
Several amazing beef selections that looked and smelled great. Waiters friendly and helpful.,5
I organized a work dinner here and we ate in a nook in the back. It was prefectly quiet and comfortable.,5
very good all around - exceeded everyone's expectations!,4
"The food and presentation were very good.  The decor and ambience was quite good as compared to most steak houses.  Our server, Jimmy Mui, was courteous and attentive and highly professional.  The manager was conversational and friendly.",5
The food at Quality Meats is among the best in the city right now. The service could not be better. The staff is warm and friendly. A great experience all around.,4
This was a really lovely restaurant with great food and a great atmosphere. The only negative was a very unfriendly waitress.,4
Steak was delicious!!! Save room for dessert! The homemade ice cream is awesome!,4
"Very good, I'll bring my parents when they come to NYC again (don't read that as a negative comment!)... they're meat-o-holics",2
"We each had a dish with crab for appetizers.  Two sent theirs back after eating 1/3 of the dish thinking the crab was bad, and the third ate theirs.  Everyone got sick throughtout the night due to - we believe - the crab.  The manager acknowledged the chef believed the crab was ""off"" but not ""unsafe"" (and didn't charge us for the two dishes that were returned), yet it is crazy to believe the crab did not cause the sickness of all three guests.  Based upon this experience, I would be less inclined to take other guests to the restaurant, especially using my expense account.",4
"Good food; sometimes you have to wait a bit longer than usual for service or to be seated (even with reservations), but it's a real hotspot so that's understandable.",4
"great experience; reservation honored immediately, no waiting.  food and service very good.",4
"Food was overall pretty good.  The steak was good but in comparison, I think there were better places for steak.  Food proportional was great.  Restaurant decor was excellent compared to other steak houses that I have been to, very modern, comfortable and spacious.  The waiters and waitresses seemed very helpful and knowledgeable.  Overall, a very good experience and I would recommend this restaurant to others.",4
"The food overall was very good, although I thought the steak lacked flavor and even though I ordered 'medium' was a little too done on the edges (only a pink center). I am from Texas so perhaps I am harder to please in the steak category. There were an unusual amount of loud obnoxious guests there that night, but maybe that is the nature of a steakhouse. A message for the sommelier: your scotch menu is mis-labeled in more than one place. For example, Oban is a highland scotch, not islay. Overall, the decor was fantastic and the appetizers, salad, and sides were unique, fresh and tasty. I would go back for sure, but I don't think I would order a steak next time.",2
"I was very excited about eating here.  We both ordered the trio of fillet. We were told they only serve it med or well done.  We ordered med and about 4 side dishes. The steaks came out of the kitchen within 10 minutes of placing the order, which lead me to believe they were assembly line cooked and sat under lamps in the kitchen.  Our steaks were fully cooked but not hot, barely warm.  Also one of the side dishes of Gnnoci and cheese was not ever room temperature.  We told the waiter that the steaks were cold, he apologized and took them away.  He returned 5 mins later with the same steaks and warned us the plates were very hot.  They just heated up our steaks again and added more sauce.  I was extremly disappointed and will not return.",5
"Great location near Central Park, reasonable walk from or to theaters (but not right in theater dist.), Carnegie Hall, MOMA.  ",5
"With a posh atmosphere, kind staff, intimidating menu, and tasty food, obviously this notable restaurant aims to please, which is does especially in terms of service. However, I feel that the food was actually the most disappointing part of the meal. The complimentary bread was good and came with three varieties, the focaccia being the highlight of the three. I ordered the astice to start, which was the waiter's recommendation.  While a great dish, beautiful in style and flavor, lacked balance. Too much cheese, not enough eggplant. I also got the sirloin in a bone marrow sauce. This impressive specimen was fork-tender and te sauce, while complex, was subtle and never got in the way of the meat. The soaked croutons on the side complemented the steak beautifully, and this dish was the highlight. Overall a good meal with a lot of food. A place I would stop back to for a good lunch.",4
"Excelente restaurante.  La comida insuperables, finas atenciones.  Diferente",5
"The crudo, pasta, fish course, and wine were excellent but the desert was a little disappointing.",5
"Celebrating my wife’s birthday with our daughter and boyfriend. Wonderful experience. Food beautifully presented and tasty, but not “rave-able”. Wine list on the high side in prices. Prize fixe dinner is an excellent way to experience this restaurant.",5
"Wonderful friendly service, delicious food especially the octopus and bone marrow pasta😀",5
"I gave the food 3 stars (good). I didn't think it warranted a ""very good"" because some of the dishes were disappointing. ",4
"Okay. The oysters were superb. If you eat oysters you know what I mean. They were fresh at the right temperature and shucked nice and clean. Each type was distinct and exact to their source. The pastas that I have had before were, this time, okay and very good. The tagliolini with baby clams was a disappointment in the overall flavor of the sauce (indistinct but for the Marea penchant for citrus) and color (unattractive brown) and its overbearing quantity over an outmatched tagliolini. The strozzapreti with crab and chili (and the much more appropriately applied citrus) was very good. Yes, I wish I ordered it. The appetizer ""astice"" of lobster and eggplant funghetto (sauted) was a curious dish looking more like a dessert with the shallow pool of burrata dominating the plate. Unfortunately, the lobster didn't save the dish. It wasn't bad. It just required a few more chews than you want from a place like Marea. And being lobster, they price it as a premium appetizer or as a supplement if part of the prix fixe. The Black sea bass was also okay. Fresh, sure. It better be. But again the fregola (like couscous)/sauce was mediocre in taste and presentation. It augmented the pricey piece of sea bass without craft or cleverness or even simplicity. The wild mushroom contorni was sad. It was barely warm and dry and clotted into a small bowl as if with an ice cream scooper. What can I say? That's how it went down that night at Marea. Maybe it's me. I eat at high end restaurants on my own dime, not on an expense account. I actually want my money's worth.",5
"Excellent service from the moment we stepped through the doorway throughout dinner and to the exit. Attentive but not overwhelming, and gave plenty of space for private conversation and time to enjoy the food. Great food in each course. Thorough wine list. Likely to bump intonation celebrity.",5
On a recent visit to New York we had a spectacular meal in a beautiful setting.,5
"Marea is a gem of a restaurant located on Central Park South. Aesthetically beautiful, it has remarkable food, and service.",5
"On a very busy Sunday evening my partner started with a Vitello Tonnato Crrostini, chilled veal with a light tuna sauce on crispy toast and I had the Tonno Crudo, raw yellowfin tuna (remarkably fresh).",5
"That course was followed by some appetizers – Polipo (Octopus) with chili oil and lemon, and a delicious warm Shrimp appetizer.",5
"For our entrée we shared the Branzino for 2, a whole fish baked in a salt crust – fantastic! It was so moist and flavorful I was begging for more.",3
"Marea is a special restaurant, well worth a visit. Like most of New York, it is not inexpensive but you leave feeling you’ve enjoyed something very special.",5
I had my birthday dinner at Marea. The service was top-notch. The food was amazing. It’s definitely worth the experience and cost. I will go over and over and over again.,5
"amazing brunch.  Food , service and atmosphere were just as expected.  We had the 2 course pre fix.  Apps were the lobster and the octopus.  Lobster was a bit chewy and i would not recommend it.  The octopus was amazing.  Entires were the fusilli which was amazing and not to be missed and the halibut which also was great.  Portions were reasonable and sufficient , especially considering how amazing the bread was.  We had the gelato and sorbet for dessert and it was very good.",5
"We had a party of 6.  Fantastic lunch.  The food was outstanding across the board.  The service was also amazing.  Great wait staff and table service.  This is not an inexpensive place to eat, but the food and services provided were outstanding.  Looking forward to going back many more times.",5
The food was outstanding. We loved everything we had. Our service was perfect until the end. We ordered dessert and then our server disappeared and the check/payment took foreverrrrrr. But overall the experience and the food was outstanding,5
"We celebrated our 10th anniversary here, and I spent weeks making wish lists of restaurants and checking reservation availability before deciding on Marea. When making the reservation, I informed staff ahead of time that this was a special occasion. When we arrived, we were greeted warmly but were then seated in the far back corner of the restaurant next to the servers’ station. It was very drafty there and I said so immediately, but the hostess merely offered to turn down the air (which didn’t happen until halfway through the meal, and it then quickly went back on). The pacing of the four-course meal was strange: it took quite a while for anyone to come offer us drinks or take our order. Other tables nearby that were seated at the same time as we were got bread and orders taken while we still waited, and we were able to clearly overhear a conversation between servers where one was trying to ask another to cover some of his tables, and the other said he was already slammed and couldn’t help out. Our first and second courses arrived with no break in between, and there was a LONG time between the 2nd and 3rd courses with no explanation provided. Dessert also arrived very quickly following the main course (and did acknowledge our anniversary, finally). The food was excellent, which was the saving grace of this meal. Otherwise, I would not recommend celebrating a special occasion at Marea since the staff were not able to help make it feel special for us and we left very disappointed. We had a much better experience at another restaurant last year and would choose to return there in the future over coming back to Marea.",5
"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Manhattan. The 4 course tasting is a bargain at $109. The menu is primarily fish and seafood but the pasta choices are great. Leave plenty of time because service is never rushed, it is an extraordinary dinner, relax and enjoy it.",3
"The place was amazing , the food was outstanding we had a great time, the service was amazing and the staff very nice and welcoming.",2
Defintiely I recommend this place,5
"The food was exceptional! I went with my mom and we both loved everything we ordered. The restaurant is exquisite and the service was fabulous as well. My only complaint is that it felt like a long time between each of our courses (we ordered the pre fix).  We arrived at 9:15 and left at 12:15. Not sure if that was supposed to happen or because the restaurant was so busy. Regardless, we will definitely be returning and this is probably one of my favorite restaurants of all time!",5
business lunch menu has reasonable price,2
excellent foods and perfect services,5
An excellent meal and service. Great overall ambience. I really dont have any constructive feedback.,5
Quality of food and service is always outstanding. Staff knowledge of wine pairing enhances the dining experience.,5
"Food was average relative to our expectation. Waitress seemed impatient for us to order. Once we ordered, I went to the ladies room and by the time I came back, both the amuse bouche AND the first course were already on the table.  Very rushed. Shouldn’t the kitchen hold back when one party isn’t at the table? Anyway, uni toast was unappetizing and pasta with ‘lump ‘ crabmeat was bland.  Have been very curious about this place, but won’t be back.",5
Far cry from a two star Michelin restaurant. Absolutely NOTHING special or phenomenal. Food was ordinary. We've had similar combinations of ingredients at unrated local restaurants. Presentation not spectacular. Service was marginal at best - not very attentive. It did not meet our expectations of a two star restaurant.,5
Excellent spot,4
"Always delicious meal with wonderfully attentive service, most of the time.",4
The place is overpriced for the quality of food.  The atmosphere is very stuffy and most of people where there for business lunch.  The décor was simple and unromantic.,5
Everything about this restaurant is a 10. From the food which not only is delicious but the presentation is outstanding as well. The staff is most welcoming and gracious. The ambience is also wonderful. I recommend this restaurant highly.,5
"Fantastic food and service. Shared dishes were served split to two plates. Not loud, which is a blessing. Lovely, cozy, stylish restaurant.",5
Marea was amazing. The service was impeccable and the food was beyond delicious. It exceeded our expectations. My husband and I highly recommend Marea---it is worth the splurge!,5
"We celebrated our anniversary here, our first time in this well-run restaurant. We choose where to eat based on reviews and word-of-mouth, focusing on comments on the food (service, ambiance, decor, noise level, while important, are secondary in our view). Marea did not disappoint.  Every dish in our 4-course meal was perfectly prepared.  The pasta was al dente, the side dishes were superb, the seafood fresh and not over cooked.  The desserts were also excellent. A great meal. The wine list is extensive and, for New York, fairly priced (can’t say that about a lot of places). The only criticism is that service was somewhat inattentive for. 2-starred Michelin restaurant, a time or two between courses, but particularly at the end of the meal, when it took too long to get our check, even though it was late and the restaurant was not full at that time.  That said, this is a great place and we will be back.",5
Great food and service. The waiter knows his business. Excellent food. Sadly a bit loud to talk with friends,5
The meal and service were excellent.,4
"However, the noise level made it heard to have a conversation without raising your voice to be heard.",4
"Seated promptly, great service, steaks good but expected more, especially for the price",4
It’s a good restaurant but  noise level is too much!!,5
"The service was impeccable. It was my birthday and they brought out some fruit my husband told them I would enjoy while I was in the bathroom. The lobster bisque was good, a little spicier than I had expected, but still delicious. Our bone in filet was incredible. This is a busy, after work feeling sort of restaurant with a lot of hustle and bustle, the 2 story windows are beautiful. They were out of the wine I wanted and they were pricey.",5
"My Daughters first time in NY and her birthday, absolutely incredible experience, everyone made her feel special.",5
"I absolutely LOVE this restaurant, but do not go if you actually want to hear someone talk...not going to happen...it is such a lively place, the acoustics are not that great.  Food is fabulous, service is great...when one walks in you would think you walked into a men's club because all you seem to see are blue and/or black suits sitting or standing around the bar...and I mean ALL you see....from 5p on it is a sea of suits....  Nonetheless, this restaurant is a must!!!!",4
The service and staff were excellent. They were attentive and really cared about our experience.,5
Definitely one of the best steak houses in the city. Food and staff where exceptional.,3
Overpriced poorly prepared steaks. Medium rare steak was closer to well and the 100 dollar lobster tail was horribly overcooked.,5
"Outstanding!!! The food is great, the staff is great. My steak was prepared to perfection. Definitely look forward to going back. A great place to celebrate a birthday.",4
Friendly happening atmosphere. Arrived early but taken quickly to table.,4
Interesting and varied menu choices. Enjoyed the business lunch - 2 courses..,4
Service very good. A little pricey but food was tasty.,5
"Not bad, not great, would go back...if I was asked too.",4
I put no to recomendation because if someone asks about the top 5 to suggest it wont be included.overall its a good restaurant,5
The food was great as well as the service. My husband is celiac and they help him with his choices and made recommendations!!,5
"Excellent restaurant, but very noisy. Exceptional wine list from all over the world.",5
"Board dinner in New York.  Great food.  Steaks done to request and excellent taste.  Great sides.  Extensive wine list, but pricey.  Maybe not for NY!  Wait staff very attentive.  Due to some delay in service, compd some of the meal items.  Located near Times Square so in the middle of the buzz.",5
Great location. Outstanding service and quality of food.,5
Service was spot on. Food was all so amazing! Drinks were perfect.  Great place for a date.,5
"We had the best waiter, Brian.  We had a birthday and mentioned it in our reservation.  The restaurant had a card for me and the waiter had dessert for me.  My sister mentioned we don't care for nuts or caramel.  Brian DELIVERED, no nuts, no caramel and to die for!  Next time, we're in town, after a show, we will be back...and asking for Brian.  The entire staff was so attentive and the entire meal top to bottom was amazing.  Thank you, Del Frisco's.",5
"This was my first visit to New York and a friend recommended Del Frisco's, all I have to say is that the atmosphere, the staff, and the food was AMAZING!!!  Wish they had one here in Miami, can't wait to go back to the NYC.",5
Great food and even better waiter.,5
Overall positive experience in all categories. Stone crab claws were amazing.,3
"So I booked reservations and then saw some mixed reviews and was a bit hesitant considering that this was my birthday dinner. But I have to say it exceeded my expectation. First we arrived an hour late due to heavy traffic, we notified the restaurant and I know the rules are they only hold 15 min but the hostess told us they would try their best. Once we arrived, there was a bit wait but considering the fact that we were an hour late the hostess was able to still accommodate us within 15 minutes. Once we were seated, that’s it, everything was perfect. Foi gras appetizer, porterhouse steak, seared tuna, lobster Mac and cheese, onion rings, house wine. PERFECT! The food came out quick, everything was delish, and the service was on point. And for that, thank you so much for making my birthday dinner perfect. oh and to top everything they added a birthday card. I felt special. Thank you!",5
Exceptional as always.  Some of the best steaks around.  Seafood too.  Paul was a GREAT server.,5
"We enjoyed the dinner, but I was  dissapointed that the server did not acknowledge my husdand’s birthday, which I had detailed in my online reservation. Overall though, we enjoyed the experience, we will be back.",5
Love Love Loved it!! Cant wait to go back. Service was exceptional and the food was to die,4
for. Highly recommend!,5
Took some out of town friends there for a great time. Steaks cooked to perfection and very generous sides. Willl be back.,4
This is my 5th at this location. Always a great. Professional and courteous staff and delicious food. UMAMI is the best way to describe every bite of the meal. You must try the seven layer lemon cake for desert.,5
The food overall was great but the steak was for some reason unevenly seasoned where one side was better than the other. The salmon my wife had was slightly overcooked and bland. The sides and crabcake were awesome though. Definitely good for a bucket list check on classic New York steakhouse.,3
We went here for dinner. The food was great. From the Appetizers to the Dessert. ALL a 10. Our waiter was very friendly and gave really good suggestions. Ambience was great and just a lively place to be. We enjoyed it so much that we went back the next night for dessert and coffee! Butter Cake is amazing!,5
Food and Service were outstanding but I was disappointed on the seating.  I had booked this months in advance requested quieter seating; we were placed in the middle if the 1st floor close to the bar.,4
"Top-notch food and attentive service. Decor is lovely -- black with red accents, modern but not cold. The meal begins and ends with the chef's generosity -- delicious amuse-bouche to start, delicious chocolates to finish -- and portion size is more than ample. The grilled octopus appetizer was amazing, better than I expected -- I highly recommend it. Since we picked this restaurant almost by accident, we were really lucky. Of course we will return!",5
Simply amazing. Would go back there in a heart-beat.,2
outstanding in every way ... recommend scallops,5
We loooooved it!!!! Food is above others we experienced during our trip to NY and the ambiance is terrific. We will be back in June definitely.,4
"The best meal we have ever had in NYC. The geoduck wasnt very good, but the 4 pastas we had were incredible. Lobster and buratta was amazing. Worth every penny.",4
"When Marea first opened it was a classy addition to the restaurant scene in our neighborhood. We have been fans of its sister restaurant Alto for a long time and when Marea opened it immediately became one of our new favorites. We have been traveling a lot in recent months and therefore hadn't been back there for several weeks. Our last visit came as a big shock: the new ""host"" at the front desk treats customers with contempt and attitude with a big A, our waiter kept calling us ""my friends"", wine service was non-existent, and our waiter kept inquiring whether diners had something to celebrate - I think we all know what happens to a restaurant in NYC when it goes down the ""special occassion"" route - very sad developments are Marea, very sad",4
Simply superb!,4
The food was very good but overpriced. Our waiter seemed too busy and I felt we did not receive the attention we deserved.,2
My dining experience was extremely enjoyable. The food and wine were delicious and the service was top notch. I will definitely recommend this restaurant to others.,4
"Amazing 12-course Le Collezione - 6 crudo, 5 pasta, 1 dessert",5
"Was there for lunch. Food, ambiance, and service were all good.",5
"Menu way too complicated, not a salad in sight. Fish stew was way too salty, halibut was good, cuddlefish too chewy and too expensive. Although the waiter was very attentive. Won't be back. Because there are so many other restaurants to choose from that are more reasonably priced that suite my taste.",4
Marea is excellent but not life changing.,4
Service and food were both over-the-top excellent.,4
This was my first visit and I absolutely loved the place. The food was seasonal and exquisitely prepared and presented. The service was friendly and professional and the ambiance was comfortable and still sophisticated. It gets a big A+!,5
"Very good seafood with just the right portion size. The ambiance was very modern/bright vs. ex-San Domenico restaurant which I really enjoyed the great Italian food. The calamari appetizer and halibut entree were cooked just right and the lunch prices are very reasonable. However, the desserts were not in the same league as the appetizer/entrees which was a disappointment and potential for improvement.",4
A good spot to entertain colleagues from out of town.,3
"We had lunch on a weekday and the place was full. The food was very good, except for the fluke appetizer - the portion was small and the fish was bland; it did not have the sweetness that I have come to expect from very fresh fish. I thought the price tag was a bit steep; appetizers, main course, dessert and coffee for two people came up to $140. For that price I would have expected the food to be exceptional.",4
Outstanding quality of cuisine in all categories.,3
One of the best restaurants in NY.,5
This is not for every one. It serves both sushi type and Italian inspired dishes. They have the most unusual beer list ever. Everything was quite well prepared . I would definitely return!,2
"Would have rated it higher, but we ordered an extra course during our business lunch, and they took the liberty of reducing the portion size of our second course. Perhaps thinking there would be too much food if they did that, but nevertheless, not their call to make. We paid for the food; serve us the food! Other than that it was quite good. I'd go back to give them a second chance...",5
"Very good food, just took forever. 7:45 reservation--sat by 8:30--didn't get food until 9:45--got the check just before 11 pm. Good restaurant just need more help and better communication.",4
"The service and the steaks were excellent. But the Corn Creme Brulee and the Gnocchi and Cheese stole the show!!! The corn is impossible to describe, just a total treat in terms of both taste and texture. The sauce for the gnocchi was creamy and amazing. It was one of our best steakhouse meals, and we have been to many in NYC and other parts of the country.",5
Dinner was excellent. Steak was cooked perfectly. The sides were tasty and the service was superb.,5
Excellent food and dining experience.  Pricey but worth it for soecial occasions,5
Hostess was not very accommodating and helpful. Left a really bad first impression.,2
"Great all around place to get a good meal. Drinks average $15 but well worth it. Not watered down at all. Fresh warm bread, table side made steak sauce and  great for any occasion.  My wife and I have had 4 date nights there so far and plan on having many more.",5
Amazing food. Great meat. Ambiance very nice. Book in advance,5
"The food, service, all of it is fantastic.",5
"But here is my favorite part of my experience, by far - my friend and I lingered after dinner. We stayed and talked and talked, completely oblivious to the fact that patrons were piling up at the bar/waiting area. At one point, the hostess/manager came to us and very discretely and politely asked us if we were done with our water. I was a little taken aback and had a moment of ""is she trying to get us to leave?"" Well, yes, in fact... that's EXACTLY what she was doing, but we weren't having any of it (remember, we were unaware of the pile-up downstairs waiting for tables). Another 30 minutes or so, and she comes back and with a lovely smile, and politely asks if we would like anything else, ""how was everything?"" So I asked ""do you need the table? Is that what's going on?"" And she said that, yes, there were a ton of people waiting to be seated but we were welcome to have a drink at the bar, on the house, and ""hang out as long as you like, please!"" ",5
"When we got downstairs to the bar, the hostess wasn't there, but another hostess came up to us and asked for us by name and then said ""We're happy to have you here, please come to the bar, our bartender will take care of you."" ",5
They poured us very generous drinks and asked if we wanted another round. We ended up staying another hour and a half.,5
"Her name is Maddie. She is wonderful. Diplomatic, generous, and very hospitable. If you go, ask for her and tell her I sent you. She has no idea who I am, but tell her anyway!",5
I know I'll be back there again. Service like this is all it takes :-),5
We had a fantastic birthday dinner party.  Food was delicious and service was excellent.,5
Superb meats but not just a steak house.  Prides itself in using local produce.  Superb wine list and exceptional wines by the glass selections.,5
"Wonderful service, superb food, one of the undiscovered gems for steak houses.  Loved it.",3
Excellent dining experience.  I had one of my bosses in from London (these folks are pretty serious about their steak because they wait for US visits until enjoying some) and he absolutely loved it. Great wine list too.,5
Empty on a Sunday night.,4
"great service and food-consistenly excellent. Friendly staff -which is not often found in ""steak houses"" Menu choices are great...loved the salds, sides and desserts as well as the steak!",4
"It was our 4th time in Quality Meats and we always recommended this restaurant to friends, because of the great meals and service. However and unfortunately, on April 13th the service wasn't that good. The waiter forgot to bring the wine to us and we had to ask for it. We got the wine on the table after we had our filet mignon served. Also, when we got the check there was a mistake on it (4 desserts instead of 2 desserts). It was very disappointing, because for us the restaurant Quality Meats was our best restaurant for the great food AND the outstanding service. ",5
Roseline,5
"Had a very enjoyable time.  6 friends met for before theater dinner and had a great time.  Service was good, the food tasty (only one meat eater in the bunch). The crabcakes were stupendous.  Unless someone is super hungry though, I would suggest that after the bread, and salad you advise dinners that one crabcake is enough, and two (dinner portion)is well, over the top.  All in all a good experience.",3
We ate very early due to an early curtain and the restaurant was quiet and service was exceptional. I don't know what it would be like at a prime dining hour.,4
"Really delicious, great food, great service, 5 stars very well deserved",5
Great food ,5
Very professional staff,5
"Great meal noise was so loud we could not hear each other talk. We were placed abutting the bar wall and everyone at the bar would be talking right over the top of us approx 8"" away. I will go back but remember to asks for a different table I. Advance.",5
"We booked on a friend’s recommendation and I must say the steaks were to die for! We travel extensively so to say the quality of food and service were both world class is no exaggeration.  On the booking I’d mentioned we were in NYC celebrating my partner’s birthday, the staff who were both attentive and superbly knowledgeable really added to the celebration.  We will definitely be back, flawless dining !! Thank you!",5
This restaurant never failed to impress. We have eaten here many times and every time has be great.,4
The food was excellent.  We had a very nice time.  Thank you.,5
"This was one of the best dinners ever and my family likes good food.   Equally important, the service was impeccable.   Was the first visit but will certainly not be the last!!",1
Amazing in every way,5
Terrific food and service this place never disappoints.  I'd highly recommend it especially during wine week.,4
A twist on the typical steakhouse ...............................................................::...,5
"Met a friend for lunch during Wine Week.  Great service (thank you Matt), delicious lunch  and fun wine tasting     Always enjoy a meal at Quality Meat!!",1
"I work in the area so have been to Quality Meats multiple times and look forward to every wine week. However, the service at my most recent visit on 7/11 with my female co-workers was awful!  My husband works in the industry so I understand that during wine week or restaurant week when restaurants are super busy you let things slide some. BUT the restaurant was the least crowded I’ve ever seen it and there were many tables open. So I cannot justify the horrible service my co-workers and I received. First, we were never served bread. That may sound trivial but this restaurant makes specialty bread and during wine week bread is important!  When I mentioned it to our server he gave us attitude and said it was on its way...liar!  The table of 6+ businessmen got their bread even though they were seated after us 4 women.  Stereotypical but it was crazy to watch other tables of men getting service while we did not! We repeatedly had to ask anyone walking by to refill our water glasses, again its wine week, water during a business lunch or any meal when alcohol is on the table is important!  Once we got our entrees no one ever came by to ask us if everything was OK, standard at any restaurant. We finally had to call a server over to wrap up our leftovers. Then had to order our dessert to go and ask for the check at the same time for fear of having to wait another 30 minutes because we were constantly ignored. As a frequent diner at this restaurant, though the food was decent, I was so disappointed with the service that I will not go back and waste my money. The Quality Meats that I was familiar with no longer lives up to the Quality Branded name.",5
Wonderful meal...from checking in until getting up to leave.  Service  and meal were  great and willl bring us back for sure!,5
We chose Marea to celebrate a birthday and weren't  disappointed. It's a beautiful and quiet place. Service is friendly and efficient and food is superb. It's a little pricey but given the  ocassion it was worth what we paid.,5
My favorite restaurant in New York! Took my wife this time and now it's her favorite as well!,1
"This was my second time at Quality Meats. I enjoyed my first time and came back for the signature double rib steak. Unfortunately, they had run out for the evening and I settled on another steak. Overall I really enjoyed myself. Good food, good service, truly a Quality meal.",3
"we didn't have to wait long for our table. It wasn't too noisy like some restaurants where you can't even hear yourself talk. And coming from Houston, were we have excellent steaks, the ones we ate were awesome. We always keep coming back to this place.",4
Been here several times and the food never disappoints!! Always phenomenal! Awesome ambiance as well.,5
Tooooo noisy,5
"Steakhouse atmosphere, extremely loud and cramped. Tables are very small. Order 2 apps and split a salad and there is no room on the table. Service was average. Bartender made a great martini.  Average dining experience for above avg prices.",2
"Outstanding steaks, great service, energetic ambiance and a memorable experience",5
Went here at the advise of a friend and we loved it!!  The food was delish and the ambience was nice (though a bit loud).  We sat on the 3rd level which did help to keep the noise level at a minimum.  Was for my friend's birthday celebration and they brought a sweet bowl of ice cream and chocolate..... great touch.  Would highly recommend for business or special occasions as the price point is rather high but worth every penny.,5
Nothing wrong with this restaurant.  Food was good but not spectacular.  Extremely popular and extremely noisy.  This was my first time here and just not what I expected.  I went there based on recommendations from friends.  Prices are good.  I would recommend this restaurant to friends but would preface my recommendation explaining the noise level and although my steak was ok other friends thought it was the best in the city.,4
A PERFECT dining experience!  Food - wonderful; service - impeccable!,5
"We have waited 38 minutes for the second course to be served,at the end I asked the waiter for the food and after 2 minutes the manager came back with 2 complimatry pasta plates.we know that we are going for a late dinner but we didn't expected our main course  to be served by 11:45 pm .",3
They should pay attention to their kitchen and if the waiter did fire the food.,5
"Pasta and the branzino were amazing.  Marea is strong in food, service, and wine program but one weakness for us are the sweets.  Never impressed with desserts even the freebies.",5
"I took my fiancé for what proved to be a wonderful dinner. Our waiter Elizabetta and our bus boy Vinny were the best!!!! And Drew really knew his wines.... Foxen Pinot noir from Santa Maria  valley! Great pairing. The specialty bone marrow pasta is so rich and flavorful that 1/2 portion is a whole meal, but we continued.... the branzino was sweet, melt-in your mouth delicious.... the mushrooms and beans were a savory complement. For the final chapter, the panna cotta w fig was the perfect ending to a perfect meal! Thanks to the staff and the chef",5
Exact fine dining experience that we were looking for our anniversary; an experience my wife and I will never forget.  Amazing customer service experience!,4
UN BONITO LUGAR PARA ALMORZAR TRANQUILO Y CON UNA BUENA COMPAÑIA Y ATENCION EN SUMA TODO BIEN GRACIAS,1
"Michelin 2*, NYT 3***. You must be joking. Ordered the Strozzapreti with Jumbo lump crab meat. You could hardly find crab anywhere in the dish unless you are using an electron microscope to find it. My wife and son's girlfriend ordered the Tagliolini with Manila clams.  Two clams and a lot of pasta, $35 dollar plates. You must be kidding. Don't waste your money here",5
"This was the best restaurant I have ever been too! It was simply amazing. The atmosphere of the restaurant was very nice, everyone was dressed up. The service was impeccable, they treat you like a star. The food was some of the best food I have ever had! I did the prix fix dinner special. First I had the lobster and burrata app and oh my god it was soo good. You NEED to get this dish! Next I had the fussili pasta which has bone marrow in the sauce and grilled octopus. This pasta was so unique, it was the best pasta dish I've ever had. Just typing this review talking about this pasta makes me want more! I ordered scallops for my entree and they were cooked to perfection. My boyfriend ordered the tagliata (sirloin) which was fantastic. He said the best steak he's ever had. Everything was absolutely amazing and I will never forget the meal we had at Marea.",4
"First trip to Marea. Enjoyed the inventive food presentation. Only issue for me was that we ordered the Prix Fixe menu - it was delicious but there was quite a bit of time between courses. While I appreciated not being rushed, we were there four hours for dinner. Had the courses been timed better, we could have reduced that by at least an hour.",3
"Great food but remarkably poor service. Water not refilled, dirty utensils, table next to us couldn't get hold of waiter to get butter for their bread so they had to ask us. Overall unacceptable for a restaurant of this caliber",1
"Despite being explicit with the waiter that we had some time constraints he completely ignored that.  As a result, when the health department came our food was not prepared and we could not have our main course.  To add insult to injury, we were offered no refund on our check!  Will never go back!",5
"The food was delicious, full of flavor, prepared with perfection.",5
Service was great.,5
Marea was great! Uniquely delish Italian cuisine. A must try! Great wine list!,2
Let me tell you something. I just got engaged and that was the bet way to top it off. Best pasta I've ever had.,5
"This used to be my favorite restaurant in NYC, but it has slowly gone down hill.  The wait staff is inattentive - had to find someone to get water.  The appetizer came before the cocktails were served.  The halibut was raw!  The waiter took it back and we had to wait 15 minutes before a new meal was served - ate by myself....",5
"An explosion of flavor in each perfectly prepared dish. Service was impeccable. Darnelle went above and beyond to make the entire experience memorable. The desserts -- though delicious -- do not rise to the near-orgasmic level of the prior courses. Still, about the best restaurant in NYC these days, as long as you're not on a budget (or, better yet. someone else's!).",4
"I love Marea, but it is difficult to make a reservation.",5
"Eat dinner, lunch menu doesn't have that much signature dish.",5
"Marea has the best pasta ever! They offer seasonal variations(with white truffles) and do so well in terms of seasoning. The staff is incredible polite and the restaurant looks like the inside of a luxury yacht. But be aware of the prices. If been several times and with appetizer, main dish and wine we spent at least $200 pp!",4
Its obvious from the moment you enter that this restaurant is focused on providing an experience that matches its reputation.....every single day. ,3
Its refreshing to find a highly rated restaurant that continues to strive for excellence in everything they do from start to finish.  ,5
Well done!,5
We chose the 4 course menu and it was too much food!!!,5
"We had my wife's birthday.  We brought a cake but we're told that we would be charged $16 per slice. It all went downhill from there.   Food was OK, but overpriced.",5
"Amazing food, drinks and service!!!!",5
Service and food was superb. Best Dover sole I've ever had.,4
Outstanding!  The house made Fusilli with charred octopus & bone marrow was bursting with fresh seafood flavor.  We'll be back 👍,4
You must try the octopus appetizer!!! We loved it so much we ordered two.   the Bronzino was perfectly prepared and reminded me of the way I had it in Spain.  Everything we ate was delicious.   I highly recommend this restaurant.   A perfect place to go pre-theatre too.,5
"Quality Meats is a great place for bigger parties, we were 13 people and had a great experience. The food was very tasty and the service was wonderful! Our waiters were very responsive and made many suggestions that we loved.  Thank you",4
Del Friscos is an amazing restaurant.  It never fails. Our waitress was incredible - her name was Liz. She recommended our bottle of wine and all the wonderful food.  I will come back again and again and hope to have a server as sweet and informed as Liz.  She made our dining experience full of pleasure. We were celebrating a birthday.,5
"Overall experience was great.  The hamachi appetizer was refreshing, with peeled grapefruit and orange sections.  The steaks were cooked perfectly, charred on the outside and medium rare.  The only issue was with the signature potato dish.  The chips came out cold and had to be returned.  Service by Dominique was  excellent!",4
"Waited 30 minutes to get table (beyond the reservation time). Ordered, waited 90 minutes for food. Then they forgot two of our steaks and brought the wrong sides. Wait staff was exceedingly rude when a member of our party pointed this out. Food was OK, but not on par with other big name steak houses. Will not return. For others looking for a steak, go anywhere else.",1
We enjoyed our waiter and staff on our special celebration. The restaurant was recommended and the quality we were looking for.,4
Excellent! And the burnt marshmallow ice cream was a surprise dream.,5
Pleasantly surprised with the service and flavor,5
"Just what we were looking for on our last night in NYC. Lively, excellent steak, great service, great  wine.",5
"Had 2 servers- A young lady that was great and a gentleman that was less enthusiastic. Dining alone, want to eat at a reasonable pace and go . Ordered crudo and steak/ ",2
"The courses came over an hour apart in spite of the fact the staff knew. Evidenced by ""sorry it's coming right away"" for half that time. Got so long I just asked for check. A minute later,  steak shows up with 3 sides I didn't order as a ",5
Gesture .  I didn't make a big fuss and left a generous tip. They comped the steak. Rather just have what I want when I want it .  I was surprised based on the love people have for this place.,4
Nice food and service. Not even trivial complaint. 100% satisfied.,2
A cut above steakhouse but not the standout I was expecting.  Expected more flavor in a $57 cut of aged beef.  Ambiance was nice but a little hard to hear above the din.  Would try Quality Eats next time as a better value option.,1
"We arrived on time for our 9pm reservation and were told to wait at the bar, we had a drink and we're sat at 9:30. Our waiter who was very nice but is simply not a good waiter brought over the menus and we ordered our food within minutes. The appetizers arrived quickly and were tasty. Then we waited... and waited... and waited for our main course, during this time the waiter didn't approach once. When the table next to us who was seated after us already received their food, we called our waiter to see what's going on, he came back and said the food should arrive shortly. Another ten minutes go by and still no main course, it's about 10:30 already... we call him again, then the hostess comes over to apologize and says that the food should be over in a minute and finally it arrived at about 10:40 or so. We didn't order anything special, simply two steaks at medium temp. We'll, my steak arrived medium well... closer to well on most ends. When the waiter asked how our dinner is, I told him the steak was over cooked (the meat quality is great!). The manager came over and offered a new steak but seriously, who can wait at almost 11pm for another steak???",4
"After our meal, we waited for a dessert menu which never arrived. Apparently because it was our anniversary they wanted to treat us for dessert which is a lovely gesture but our waiter never came to ask or offer coffee/tea/drink... nor if we wanted another dessert. It was very strange. I am actually on a special diet and was going to order the berries... but no one came to ask. ",5
"So to sum it up, meat quality was good but not cooked to order and service was poor, even though the place didn't feel that crowded when we sat down.",5
"I have no idea how this restaurant has received such high ratings. It is not a traditional steakhouse in the Wolfgang's or Peter Luger tradition. The tables are very close and the noise level is uncomfortable. Our appetizers were good but were very small portions. We had ordered a porterhouse for two, medium rare, which came on a platter which was devoid of any moisture. The steak was so overcooked and laden with grissle that I couldn't cut into it. The waiter, seeing the steak, didn't take my offer to try and cut it himself. We left, paid the bill with a 20% tip for the appetizers and stopped at a pizza place for two slices. You could do much better than this place.",2
The food was really good. Filet mignon was cooked to perfection. Brought my 6yr old son. It's a bustling atmosphere so it worked out. The lighting is really dim throughout the place.,5
Top-quality steakhouse experience! Bacon appetizer and the three filets were standout.,3
We live in the neighborhood and go to Quality Meats frequently. The service is very attentive yet unobtrusive. The food is always consistently excellent.  We prefer the main floor seating area.... the upstairs seems to be a bit noisier as the restaurant gets busier. We highly recommend Quality Meats for both lunch & dinner.,5
Our food came out extremely fast and we felt like we were being rushed out. The veal chop was extremely rare even for my husband who usually eats meat on the rare side.,5
"Come hungry leave happy. Always enjoy a quality meal at Quality Meats. The steak, as always, was great.",3
"40 minutes delay in our reservation, and front desk far away of being gentle and polite.",1
"Great, but the steak was a bit over done. Appreciated the free desserts however.",2
"Memorable meal, an array of delicate flavors",5
"The spaghetti Neri and the bread were delicious, but the tuna carpaccio was ridiculous: 4 tiny pieces of it over cucumber slices- zero flavor to it; for $24 I expect a carpaccio I'll remember for good reasons. The waiter was not very friendly although all the bread/water/buzz men were.",5
Always a top notch dining experience @ Marea.  Pasta dishes are divine & easily paired with a lovely glass of wine.  Only downside of this visit was a chewy grilled octopus 1st course.  Even with that won't be deterred from an eager return.,5
Amazing dishes. Waiter Michael was such a great person. Food runners and busboys were also very kind.,5
My splurge when I meet my son in NYC. My meals have always been perfect equally matched by the service. You'll probably need the assistance of the Somalier to help you navigate the wine list which is prominently composed of wines from vineyards that are not familiar. ,3
Had a pasta sampler and a salt encrusted branzino. Both were outstanding.,5
"Amazing server, amazing chef's choice menu",4
Excellent. As always.,4
I have been instructed to write a review of at least 50 characters. My first 21 would have sufficed.,5
The steak was not cooked correctly and had to be sent back twice.  It was then dried out and was awful.  They did not take it off the bill. The pasta special wasn't good either.  We had a really bad meal.  The manager was nice and gave us free desert.  The waiter was helpful but couldn't help us on bill and manager made no effort to take the meal off the bill.   Quality Meats is great but it sure did not transfer around the corner.  This was a very bad experience and we will not be back.,1
Over-priced and poor service. I've had hundreds of better steaks.,5
Staff was very attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu and options.,2
This visit was a disappointment ,5
The best ribeye I have ever had!  I ordered without butter and was still so rich and perfect. Amazing food.,5
"Beyond amazing. I love this New York Del Frisco’s only! Great food, and great service. My wife loved everything as well.",5
Our waiter Brandon was the best.  He surprised my wife with a Birthday card signed by the staff.  A small gesture that went a long way.  One of the best steaks I've ever had.,5
"Busy! Long wait time, but the steak was cooked, seasoned and presented perfectly. Only difficulty was choosing the cut - they all good great. Went with the bone-in tenderloin- super tender. The sides were good, not great. Somehow had space to for a bit of lemon cake - not disappointed.",4
Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steakhouse served us great food.,5
Amazing experience. My lady enjoyed it to the max. Very pleased with the service. The food. Everything was perfect.,5
"This restaurant is a go-to treat for us.  The food is usually reliably good as well as having great service.  We were promptly seated and assisted with our wine selection.  We ordered the house red (bottle),  tuna tartare, bacon, a ceasar salad and a rib eye with truffle butter and lobster mashed potatoes.  After expressing to our waiter that my husband has a cheese allergy, he was still served the ceasar salad - when we reiterated that he cannot eat cheese, they returned with another ceasar salad, with no sprinkled parmesean but the dressing still had cheese in it!  When our steak arrived, they'd forgotten the truffle butter, and it was too late to order.  The lobster mashed potatoes were luke-warm. So this particular night was a miss for us, which was disappointing.",3
"Solid steak, cocktails and sides. Seafood hit or a miss. Weird mix of corporates, tourists,  theatre and datey crowd. Took us a while to get seated despite reservation. They were super busy for Monday.",4
"Made the whole spec occasion thing work very well - wishes, card and a free desert platter with candles 🎂 👍.",5
"Had a wonderful experience, big thank you to Joyce, she was our waitress and provided outstanding service",2
"No dice nada, digno de ser obviado.",5
"Soso, rancio y mal atendido podrían ser algunos de los calificativos de este restaurante que únicamente tiene a la altura sus precios (dignos del Midtown de Manhattan; sobre los 100$ persona sin vino ni postre).",5
"Con estos precios no es admisible un mantel sucio, una camarera que no te pregunta el punto de la carne o te trae la cuenta sin haberla pedido, además de tener que estar buscándola para que te traiga bebida.",2
No recomendable en mi opinión.,4
Always a solid spot. On the expensive side but you know your getting a great steak and tremendous service everytime.,5
"We love Del Friscos. We celebrated our 40th anniversary and were treated royally. Thank you to Chris, our exceptional waiter who made some excellent recommendations. Everything tasted exceptional and delicious. To top it all off,  we were treated with their signature desserts to celebrate. Could not have been happier.",2
"La calidad de la carne 🍖 absolutamente muy lejos de la calidad y el precio . Pico  jugosa y muy mal parrillero , los previos excesivos para tam nefasta calidad .",2
Es un engaño el sitio !!!,5
Fantastic service and great food but expensive,5
"One of out favorites easily competes with Peter Luger as to which is the best steak house in NYC.  Food was great, timely honoring of reservation and the service was  beyond phenomenal .  Did I mention their extensive wine list, where I was able to find the Pinot Grigio we love by the grape it was made from.",4
"Location has gone down hill.  Ok service - food ok, chefs ruined the  steak by not know steak temperatures.",5
"First, we were seated in a very tiny table with no room to sit back or even have missed ch on the table. The noise level was extreme that we had to shout to hear each other. Our table was right by the stairs and the waiters were up and down at least 100 times during our meal. Just not what was expected for a special birthday dinner for my wife. Very disappointed as Del Frisco’s was suggested from a friend.",3
I never cease to be amazed at both the quality of the service and of the product.  The steak was absolutely terrific and their signature drink - VIP - is dynamite!,5
"From start to finish, every aspect of our dining experience was impeccable! Our server, Kenny, was kind, knowledgeable and very prompt, waiting in the wings, anticipating our every need.  While expensive, it was worth it! Only regret was not having enough time for dessert as we had a play to attend. Gives us a reason to return to NYC and Del Frisco’s!",5
We have been there many times service and food are always superb.,4
"Virginia, our server for the evening, made the four hours fly by effortlessly ... she is terrific and we will request here the next time we are back!",5
"For a 45-day aged steak, it was incredibly chewy.  Not much flavor.  The lobster mashed potatoes, Brussels sprouts, and bacon appetizer were all excellent.  The steak, however, left much to be desired.",3
Our waiter was great! Very attentive and was able to get us in and out in time for our concert! Our steaks were not cooked correctly and we had several people come and apologize. They steaks came back cooked perfectly and quickly. The hostesses however were a little abrupt.,4
"Absolutely amazing! Had a wonderful meal, excellent service! Every time I come to the city I eat here@",4
"Aunque teníamos reservación , la mesa nos las dieron 50 minutos después . Comida excelente, buen ambiente",5
Dined here twice and each time was superb. One issue however... Made a reservation at 845pm on a Wed evening through OpenTable but was not sat until 930pm. Rough but they gave us many free appetizers and sides to compensate. Terrific food but beware this place is loud inside.,5
waited almost 1 hour for our table with a screaming crouwd around us at the bar.,5
This was the most disappointing meal. I am a fan of the Quality brand but can say I will not be back. We were seated 20 plus minutes after our reservation and had 3 waiters pretty much serving the entire dining area. We ordered the bacon appetizer which came out ice cold. We asked for a new one and 20 minutes later the waiter brought the same exact ice cold bacon. For a high end restaurant this was an embarrassment. The steak was average - nothing special. We were celebrating our 5 year anniversary and we didn't even get dessert. The manager did not come over to ask about the experience. Such a terrible experience for the price. Do not come here.,4
The noise level makes this restaurant a torture chamber and ruins its good food.,5
Have dined here for years.  Best steak (meat) in the city by a factor.  The bar area is my favorite as it's sub terrain and cozy...  Great for weekend dates and late lunches biz of otherwise.,5
We live in the neighborhood and are thankful that the best steak restaurant in New York City/?the country/?the world is in our backyard.  The best staff.  Food always comes out perfect even when it's very busy.,3
Great decor and food. Our butter had an outrageously long hair in it. We told the waiter and they brought a new butter however we had to ask 3 separate times for them to finally remove the hairy butter.,3
"Amazing as per always. This is our go to in NYC for consistent service, amazing food and just an enjoyable experience I can know will deliver while hosting our friends and family.",3
Sirlion steak was prepared perfectly.  Service was excellent.,4
Service is Declining,5
"3 of us had the Branzino.  Not very tasty, and over cooked. The table side prep of the cannoli was a nice touch and all the service was good, but I would not order this desert again either. It was PACKED! Too noisy and overall I would not order anything I ordered again. For an appetizer I ordered the fusilli with eggplant.  Again, not something I would order again.  With so many awesome restaurants in NYC, I felt bad I picked a so-so one for my last night in the city on this business trip. What a BIG place it is.",1
We made great choices from a very well done menu (which is good because our waiter was not the most knowledgeable). Loved the setting and décor scheme but 10% more lighting would have been perfect. The gent who served the cannolis from the cart (cannoli cart - yes!) was so nice and knew exactly what he was doing so perfect ending to a really good time.,4
I was here before and I'll be back again and again!,5
"Quality Italian meant to us that we would get fabulous pasta dishes or fish.  Instead, pasta is only on the menu as an appetizer (small) and they push the meat!  We ordered chicken parm...OMG, awful.  It was pressed chicken (think nuggets) made into shape of pizza (novel idea).  We took one bite and we're done.  They need to redo this place as I saw many other tables with the same horrible dish and barely eaten.",2
Our first time at Quality Italian. We were impressed and had a wonderful meal. Will certainly return!,5
Great place to take friends or parents or out-of-town guests. Uniquely New York with great food.,5
OYSTERS WERE WONDERFUL,4
SUGGESTED WINE WAS PERFECT.,2
Was really looking forward to dining here but unfortunately the food did not meet our expectations. We ordered the Veal Chop and the Dover Sole with sides of broccoli rabe and corn cream brulee. Everything was a bit bland. The dinner we made the night before from Plated was better. Really wanted to love this place.,5
"We will definitely return to Quality Italian.  The food was spectacular, as was the service.  I would rate this restaurant as one of my top five ever.",5
"Friends from out of town had eaten here the last time they were in NYC and raved about it, but I had forgotten. So they were back in NYC this past weekend and we all went. What a vast improvement over the former tenant in this space: Staples! This is a huge enterprise, but the food was excellent and flavorful. The place was packed, even on a Sunday night. Service was exemplary.",1
Service was extremely poor. The food was lacking.  Ambience was blah.,5
the chicken parm pizza was out of this world.  It is a must have.  Food was superb.,5
"Fabulous evening with the perfect formula: Delicious Cuisine, friendly service and great ambiance.",5
"best ""chicken Pizza""! great meats and it is better to go with more than 3 people!",4
We were seeing Cabaret and met for dinner at Quality Italian as I had heard great things about it. Vibe was great and the food was very tasty! The chicken parm pie was delicious as was the spaghetti squash side dish! I only wish we were able to have dessert but we ran out of time.  Service was great ! Will go back soon!,5
The experience at Quality Italian was outstanding!,4
"Went to Quality Italian with some reservations but it turned out to be a great experience. I was there for Wine Week with two friends.  We ordered burgers, creamed corn brulee, sauteed spinach and pasta with a veal ragu.  Burgers were a bit too salty and cooked medium even though ordered medium rare.  Everything else was delicious, especially the pasta, although the pasta serving was too small for $29.  Deserts were chocolate olive oil cake and ricotta ice cream.  Both were pretty bad.  So I would definitely go again.  The reason is that the service from the maitre'd to the waiter and bus people was absolutely one of the best experiences I've ever had.  And to me service is almost as important as food.",4
Quality Italian was the noisiest restaurant I have ever been in. I could not even hear my wife on the other side of the table. The staek was very good but the service was slow and spotty. There are much better choices for this expensive price range in NYC.,5
"Great way to participate in Wine Week.  Location, staff, food, wine and atmosphere is excellent.  Recommend anyone who has not tried the Quality Italian Steakhouse to put it on their to do list....",5
"Defkintiely a 'new' staple in midtown although they have been around for a while now.  Great for Wine Week lunches.  Only con is no Chicken Parm special during lunch - but hey, that just means another visit during dinner hours -  things could be worse!   :-)",4
I went with my office for wine week and it was great! The Tuscan salad was great for lunch and I loved that I had a selection of items to add into my salad. My boss got a lobster roll and they were amazing. I would love to come back for dinner!,4
"I took my family for brunch on Sunday and was amazed by the intriguing selections.  We started with the Monkey Bread which is a must.  It is served in a small pan, hot out of the oven, oozing with flavors to which you can add sea salt and butter.  We each tried something different-breakfast risotto, an egg white frittata and buckwheat pasta with an egg sunny side up.  It was all very tasty and filled with many flavors.  We tried to figure out what we were tasting.  It was all very good.  We had some gelato for dessert and the flavors were unusual and quite good.   We decided that we would like to go back for dinner and try their creativity with that menu.",5
"Service was great, food was great, wine list was extensive.  The place was very busy and quite loud but it provided for a good sense of energy.",5
The fod was great and abundant.  The service was attentive.  Great place!,5
Outstanding dining experience!!!!!,2
Can't wait to go back,5
"Went to QI for brunch. Instructed waiter my wife had a severe lactose intolerance. When my wife ordered frittata, I specifically asked if it contained cheese. Waiter assured us it did not. Our meals all came out. My wife began to eat, quickly discovering to our horror her frittata DID contain cheese. Waiter argued with us, then returned to kitchen, then confessed it was cheese-laden. As our guests and I ate our meal, my wife waited with nothing to eat. Twenty minutes later, a new cheese-free frittata was brought out, after we had all finished our meals. Waiter was minimally apologetic and no one from management stopped by to apologize for this shameful idiocy on the poorly trained waiter's part.",5
Too bad-the rest of the food was good.,5
outstanding restaurant from quality of food to service.,5
"Fantastic food, good service and great atmosphere albeit a little loud and crowded.",5
"OMG, this place is incredible! The night started with a dead on Perfect Rye Manhattan. I think a restaurants ability to make the classic cocktails is a great indicator of how good the restaurant will be. ",4
"The food was amazing, but I ate so much,  I just couldn't decide what NOT to try. I had a Caesar salad, the Tomahawk steak, the Kale Carbonara, + the table split the Chicken Parnigiana (and still left 1/2 over). the addition of honey on the chicken was out of this world and makes me wonder why I haven't added it to all the take out that I have had over the years! The service was great, and they were very gracious about my bringing my own wine.  A quick note, the place (on a Thursday) is on the loud side.",1
"Terrible name for the restaurant. But, everything else is amazing. Highly recommend for anyone that wants great food in an energetic environment.",3
"This has become one of my favorite restaurants while only dining here once. They hit all aspects of what I look for in having a great meal. Service was phenomenal, food couldn't have been better and the atmosphere, while very crowded, seemed just to be background noise. Great atmosphere.",4
Went here for my wedding anniversary.  The food was delicious and our waiter was nice enough to offer us a champagne toast and dessert even though we didn't ask for them.  The agnolotti was amazing and we shared the porter house steak which was cooked perfectly and delicious.  We also got the baked clams which were made with toasted angel hair pasta instead of regular bread crumbs.  ,5
The service was nonexistent. Second time in two weeks that we happen to select a wine that they claim to have just sold their last bottle. ,4
If the food was not so good this would no longer be on the rotation.,2
We don't like the restaurant at all. The waiter was not kind the meat was very very bad the fries were sticky the bake potatoe más mashed and cold. I would never recomend this restaurant to any body,3
I enjoyed the food as well as the wine options here. The service is great and the location is extremely convenient.,5
Thank you the amazing anniversary dinner and the delicious cake!,5
"This was a restaurant that I was looking forward to for enjoying my birthday dinner. I was in with reservation for 6pm dinner. Right from the start service was slow, and that was with two dedicated servers. On ultimately ordering, baked oysters, they arrived cold. I was in such disbelief, I re-ordered the same appetizer. It arrived Luke warm.  I was disturbed by the explanation given and decided not to stay for the entree. The GM visited my table  for feedback, once I requested my check.The appetizers were not charged. My visit to QM was disappointing and I cannot recommend to anyone.",5
"Nice staff, awesome quality meat(s)!",4
"Delicious steaks, unusual sides and starters! We had the bone marrow to begin, which was unctuous and mouth watering. We then shared the porterhouse, quality potato, and buttered edamame. I would order any or all of these dishes again, but there are so many other options that we will have to try next time!",5
"Not sure what other reviewers are excited about here but there is nothing special about this place. It's actually quite bad, especially considering the prices. It doesn't matter how many days they dry-age their steaks or how big the cuts are.  Steak was burnt the first time it came out, tough and chewy the second time around (we had the aged rib steak). Waffle fries were bland and limp. Hostesses were snooty. Main waiter was inattentive and with an attitude. The only positive note was a second waiter that offered us a free appetizer while our second steak was being prepared. There are plenty of good steakhouses in New York, this is just not one of them.",5
Portion size small. Steak raw in the middle. Veal chop eye was very smalll. Not worth the price.,5
"Dining alone is hard for me, so I sat at the bar. The bartender was very friendly making conversation and amazing drinks. My food was AMAZING! I will def go back!!!!",3
Love this place!,5
"We arrived 15 minutes early for our reservation. We were told they were waiting for nice table upstairs to become available for us to celebrate our anniversary. We waited almost 45 minutes and still got the same answer. We finally told them that we will sit at whatever table they had. Within 5 minutes they escorted us to a delightful table upstairs. Our server, Kenny, immediately came over and told us that because we had wait so long, our first cocktail was on him! They also served us a crab cake appetizer and lemon cake for dessert on them! Totally not expected and was completely surprised at our wonderful treatment. The manager stopped by on a couple of occasions to see how things were going and apologized for the delay each time! This was our 2nd time to Del Frisco Steakhouse and we will go back! The food and service was wonderful!",5
Reservations at 8:00 and was seated at 8:38.,5
Food was great. Very loud. Waiter and staff were very friendly and attentive. Sommelier was very very slow getting us wine and one bottle ordered with salad barely made it before we finished our steak.,3
"As always the steaks are superb. Our servers were extremely efficient, helpful, charming. The wine list is vast but there is something for everyone. The cocktail are generous.  We had a high-end Bordeaux and it was in fine condition. The side orders were delicious. We were dinner for five and there was not a morsel of food left. But Del Friscos is like this all the time; the restaurant simply excels at what it does. Expensive but worth it.",4
"Excellent service, really worked hard to make sure we were taken care of.   Definitely on the pricey side.  $250 each with tip for an appetizer, main, 2 shared sides and $100 bottle of wine.  Food was excellent, but the ambience was a bit touristy compared to some of Manhattan's classic old steakhouses.",5
We had an amazing experience at Del Friscos.  The food and drinks were phenomenal!  We would highly recommend this restaurant.  Well done Del Friscos!,5
"Del Frisco's always superb!  The best steaks, scallops, anything you order.  We love the Crab Cakes, Bone-in Filet, Onion Rings...and the list goes on!  Ambiance and service always on point!  Love Del Frisco's",5
"Great venue for a business lunch or any business event, though the steak is average to mediocre.   Consistency is a big problem here and there are certainly far better steaks available in town.",3
Did not care for the seating layout....small table at the bottom of a busy staircase.  Steaks Good...perfectly cooked and seasoned. Dessert out of this world-butter cake. Yum.  Waitress Shya very professional and friendly.,4
Everything was delicious. I would definitely go back there again and would recommend to anyone looking for a good italian meal.,5
"From a waiter that does not have the guts to speak out but mumbles loudly to an ineffective manager who cannot control an unruly bald staff member, this place is awful. Any amount of repeated courtesy shown towards them was lost. A pity since ambiance was great and majority of the staff will lose out to a few rotten apples",5
"After arriving on time for an 8PM reservation, our party of 3 was asked to wait at the bar. After 15 min waiting, the hostess came to apologize for the wait and to tell us it would only be a few more minutes for us to be seated. We ended up waiting a total of 30 min for the table. The server at our table was very efficient and kind, with the first course arriving only 10 min after ordering, but after the main course dishes were retired, our server never returned to offer dessert menus or even the check. We waited 30 min before we were able to catch another server's attention to request the check. The food was very good, but not good enough to stand such inconsistent service.",3
"Marea was fantastic! If you liked the original Fiamma, you will love Marea. Some of the menu is reminiscent of Marea, and all of it is delicious. Waitstaff was fantastic - helpful, professional and friendly. The space is open and comfortable, not overly formal or stuffy. We had a fantastic evening and loved everything about the restaurant.",5
"The server guided us perfectly through the menu and we ordered the perfect combination of crudos, pastas, and entrees for 4. The dining room is layed out wonderfully and the decor is fun and elegant. Overall it was a great experience and worth the $300/couple.",4
"incredible food , excellent presentation.",4
"Enjoyed lunch although the menu is quite pricey. Also, the chef could cut down on the salt a tad. Nice atmophere, though, and it is an ideal venue to entertain clients.",4
"Great as always. Top-notch food,wine and service.",5
"I had lunch at the bar, the menu offers predominantly seafood, the calamari and scalllops I had were very good. I enjoyed watching the passing crowd on Central Park South as I ate. I did not see the full menu but, judging from lunch, the chef is creative and food well prepared. I'll go back for dinner.",4
"Supremely fresh fish and seafood, inventively prepared. Relaxed, non-stuffy atmosphere with extremely helpful and friendly waitstaff (thank you, Sophie -- you were fantastic and really helped steer us in the right direction). Have the sea urchin with lardo. Really! And the octopus fusilli with bone marrow. And a lobster and burrata salad that was to die for. Expensive but worth it. Lunch is a relative bargain. Some wines are surprisingly reasonably priced. Well organized and impressive wine list. I wish I could afford to go once a week. Michael White is a genius.",5
"The food, ambiance and service were excellent. The sommelier gave excellent advice on a choice of wine and she did not seem to be pushing overly expensive wine, as should be the case. My one quibble is the baked gift that is given to the women departing the restaurant and not the men. It is the only time that I have been in a restaurant that it has only been offered to one gender and not the other.",5
"We were celebrating two birthdays and it was a great place to do so. Festive atmosphere, beautiful glassware and table settings, attentive staff all made it memorable. The wait staff was not overbearing and there was a casual feel to the restaurant. But the food was tops. Everything we had was prepared beautifully and served with class. One dessert left me cold, a cheesecake with coconut. Pre fixe was a good value. Thoroughly enjoyable and a very nice NYC experience, even for locals like us.",4
The food was outstanding. The service was impeccable. A totally enjoyable evening. The suggestions from the wait staff was spot on and we enjoyed the entire experience. You must try the fuscilli with red wine braised octopus & bone marrow it was to die for. The sea urchin with lardo was so decadant I could have stopped right there and been satisfied.,5
"We were greeted as ""let me do you a favor and allow you to pay to dine here""",2
The service was erratic and the waiter seemed overwhelmed.,3
It's a sad experience when the food was so highly recommended and the experience is such a let down.,5
"Lovely restaurant, attentive service. Portions were woefully small for price point, even understanding cost of good seafood. I went home and had a second dinner after eating there. Not ideal obviously.",5
"Seafood well done is a delight, but for the prices, I want a bit more creativity. I have had just as good seafood for less--takes skill to do it right, but does not necessarily need to cost close to $50 for a fish soup.",5
"Fresh tasty salads, deeply flavored pasta.",5
"Food, Drink, Service - Never disappoints!!!",5
The crudo was phenomenal. Service was polished and attentive. One of my favorite meals in New York.,4
"this was a perfect meal- particularly the crudo,pastas and desserts. that is where the talent shines. the fish was very good but not quite as special. the service was perfect and helpful. great place for pre- licnoln center or theater or for a special occasion.",5
Best Italian Seafood Restaurant in NYC. A must visit!,5
"Had the tasting menu (6 courses) and found it to be overwhelming in quantity and very rich. High points: lobster with burrata, softshell crab, crudo, panna cotta. Weak points: swordfish (ordinary) pistachio cake (sticky/gummy), I wish there had been more than one shrimp with the otherwise undistinguished pasta. Be forewarned that this is very rich food. Part of the reason people love this place is that there is a lot of butter in a lot of the food. Overall I thought Marea was excellent but not transcendent.",4
"Good, but had to wait 4 minutes for table with reservation.",5
The food and service were superb. It does get very loud.,4
Always a good time with great food and service,5
"Very good food and service but very loud.  We're there 7:30. If don't want noise, try lunch.",4
"Impeccable service by Victoria! If you like food with a twist of different ingredients , this is your place.",5
Great and creative food. The staff was friendly and efficient We had a very nice and delicious meal. When in NYC I would go back,5
"truly wonderful food. a great restaurant for a special occasion, or for the rich. (in fact, it is full of rich people.) for reasons i can't put my finger on, it doesn't seem to me as graceful or gracious as say 11 madison park, still my favorite special-occasion restaurant. but--truly wonderful food, accomplished service, and because the friend i took there on her birthday loves fish, for her it was absolutely the right place.",5
"Beautiful ambience, outstanding food, great value for the business lunch menu. I would definitely go back!",4
"This place is amazing! Everything was delicious from start to finish. We had the 4 course pri fixe dinner and everything couldn't have been better. Will definitely be back again, so enjoyable, so amazing!",5
I went for lunch.  Incredible food.  Great crudo.  Delicious.,4
"I went for lunch with my long time foodie friend. The hostess and servers were attendant and polite. They made me feel relaxed even though the restaurant is top of the notch. The service, china, and location is excellent.The content of the menu is very comprehensive and simple.",5
"I ordered a antipasto ""Astice"", a lobster and Burrata salad with pickled celery and tomatoes. I loved the freshness of the ingredients. The composition of the creaminess of the cheese and the acidity from the celery was harmonious. I never tasted a celery so good. Then the fresh semolina spaghetti with sea urchin. The pasta stayed al dente during my conversation which was a plus. the dessert was amazing!The pistachio cake/gelato. A little expensive but i'll go agai",4
"Fabulous! One of the best meals and dining experiences I've ever had. We opted for the Taster's Menu with wine pairings that was a delicious adventure. The staff was very attentive, friendly and explained every course and wine. I would highly recommend. Only warning ... price is not for the faint of heart, but was definitely worth it.",5
"Marea is one of our favorites, and their lunch menu is a relatively affordable way to be able to eat their exceptional pastas and fish.",5
We celebrated a fortieth birthday with this dinner and we couldn't have chosen a better place. Every aspect of our meal was outstanding and everyone around us seemed to be completely enjoying the evening as well. We had a truly memorable experience.,5
"The octopus/bone marrow fusilli was the best pasta dish I have had in NYC. Prior to that, the honor belonged to the beef cheek ravioli at Babbo, but I think you might have supplanted them. And, with a larger space and if you make it there at a reasonable time, I am sure it will probably be easier to get a seat there than at Batali's madhouse.",5
"The waitstaff and front-room staff was all very accommodating and cordial. A restaurant that makes me proud to live in NYC -- not just any old Italian place, but one marked by their fresh seafood and attention to prime ingredients.",5
What a wonderful evening. The staff was attentive and the food excellent. The appetizers were yummy. The sea bass was the best I've had. We all left raving!,4
"Warm and elegant space, excellent proportion of staff to customers, well waited on, but not in your face, and the food was wonderful. You must be in mood for fish and seafood but rarely find that cuisine done as well as this.",4
Bring all your credit cards - you'll need them. But this time it's worth going overboard for.,1
"The restaurant is beautiful; fresh flowers etc.The hosts and greeter warm and friendly. The Manager walks the floor and stops by tables to make sure everything is good. Boy is it! The food is out of this world. The crudos are incredible, fresh and flavorful. The pastas are exceptional and the well.. the fish! wow! We had the black bass and it was cooked to perfection! The price fixe 4 course is a great offer and we will try it next time. The wait staff is so professional and on they add another level of excellence. The place is very well staffed so water, bread, clean up etc is spot on. I highly recommend Marea for a special occassion as well as the interior is beautiful and elegant. I would rate it with the big boys, Per Se and Le Bernadin",4
this is one of the best restaurants I have been lately.,4
for a coincidence I was invited at a dinner party for 15 people art night and it was delicious in a private room downstairs.,4
"a few days later a friend invited me for lunch , this time upstairs.",4
i have to say the food is outstanding .,5
It is really worth every penny.,5
renata,5
"Great food, service and atmosphere.",4
Drinks were also professionally prepared.  Sooooo loud. You really have a hard time having a conversation. A little too rushed as well.,5
"Always excellent food at Quality Italian. Limited menu so if you're dining with a fussy eater check the menu, but all dishes are excellent. Appetisers are the pick, and the corn creme brulee is a must-try!",5
"Our waitress was by far the best waitress we've ever had. The food was great, the service was great. I couldn't have asked for anything more. We booked this reservation earlier the same day in NYC. I was so appreciative to get in. Thank you open table and thank you Quality Italian for a great experience and a wonderful meal. ",5
"Sincerely,",5
Luke O'Oconnor,4
"Mothers Day couldn't have been more enjoyable by good food, service, ambience, and location. Face it..you can have great food but horrible service can just ruin things. It is not the way at Quality Italian. Our server Natasha made everyone feel like family. Manager is running a tight but happy ship. You can tell the team works well. Natasha gave us spot on pasta and accompaniments with our steaks. Big bill, and I feel like it was worth it. Go enjoy!",5
Service was unbelievable!  Food was scrumptious.  Definitely has become one of my favorite restaurants.,4
Very accommodating with good service and food,1
Veal Marsala was delicious. Gorgonzola filet cooked perfectly. Service was great. Cannoli were great,5
"Crab Appetizer, Tomahawk Steak, and Pistachio Ice Cream with Pizzelles and cherries were all Terrific...5 stars, but the other entree of Garmiccelli, was sitting in a soup of oil and too fatty.  Maybe that is how the dish is supposed to be, but it was not great.   Everything else though was Aces!",5
"Terrible experience. Steaks were all cooked to very rare, notwithstanding we ordered them at various different temperatures from medium rare to medium well. Atrocious service - we had to flag a waiter down every time we needed anything because ours was nowhere to be found. Very loud music, very bad music playing in the background - too loud to be able to comfortably talk over. They used to serve the Duckhorn cab by the glass, and have now discontinued it and replaced it with a proprietary ""Quality Italian"" cab - almost comedic. This place is filled with tourists and appears to have devolved into nothing more than a tourist trap. Avoid at all costs.",5
"We thoroughly enjoyed our evening.  The food was great.  Our waiter was very engaging.  Quality Italian was an overall fun restaurant.  However, we were not pleased by the maitre'd who rudely kicked us off our table after we hit the ""3 hour time limit"" without any warning.",4
Went to try the chicken parm pizza.  AMAZING! Also try the corn creme brûlée as a side dish. I've never tasted something so good. This was our second time to this restaurant. The first time we were blown away. Y the service. This time we found the service to be lacking. Overall we would go back.,4
"This was the second time I've been to Quality Italian and it was just as delicious the second time, tired something new and was not disappointed. Had to have another bowl of the Cesar salad, no need to change that, and it was as great as the last time. Certainly would recommend it to anyone who's going to be in NYC and is looking for an outstanding meal.",5
Excellent food.  Wonderful service.  Had a great time.,5
Was reluctant to have brunch at such a well known nightspot but I could not have been more wrong. The food was unique but wonderful and the service was great. Would definitely recommend for a different but terrific brunch.,5
Amazing atmosphere and great location! The food and service was awesome!,5
"You get what you pay for...And this is a great meal.   Great food, great service great wine and bar.  I've been here a half dozen times and really haven't had a negative experience.   Highly highly recommend.",5
It was expensively,3
Amazing food great place,5
"Big fan of Quality Italian and it's nearby sister restaurant Quality Meats.  Great food, service, atmosphere and location. Will be back soon.",5
"Quality Italian lives up to its name. I had the sausage & pepper garlic toast, which , is a savory treat. Another appetizing treat was the corn crème brulee, which was smooth, yet not too sweet. The lamb chops were a full well-seasoned meal, by themselves. They were wonderfully accompanied by the restaurant's version of the Manhattan, The Midtown. The meal was topped off by a heaping helping of cantaloupe sorbet, adorned with melon balls, which was the perfect cool-down, to a gastronomic workout. Our server was attentive. We were also asked by the restaurant manager, how the food & service were. Being a friendly conversationalist, this gentleman learned that my mother and I, were celebrating our birthdays and surprised us with birthday cannolis. I gladly recommend Quality Italian, to my fellow diners.",4
"Amazing food, amazing service, amazing drinks... highly recommend the lobster pasta, rib eye steak",5
"Great meal, but I think we over stayed our welcome.   Got distinct impression they needed our table when they cleared our water glasses.  In their defense, we were there for nearly 3 hours !",4
Amazing food. Or server was awesome as well. Pricey ($200 for 2) but well worth it,5
"If you want to be feel the energy of NYC this is a must restaurant to dine at.  Like its sister restaurant, Quality Meats, the energetic atmosphere at Quality Italian is loud, contagious and fun.  Waitstaff is outstanding, catering to your every need.  Do not be deterred by it's name as the menu has an array of food choices for the pickiest seafood and meat eater.  Tables are placed very close together so it's hard to carry on a conversation but you'll be too busy gobbling up their apps, main dishes and delicious drinks so it's all good.    Make your reservation through Open Table early because this hot spot fills up quickly.",5
"GREAT food, GREAT service.. lots of fun.. the Parm pizza ruled",5
Must try their short ribs - the best!! I have ever tasted,5
Extremely loud restaurant. Food has nothing special,2
Meh. Not as good as Quality Meata with a pretty limited menu.,3
"I had a business dinner here and the food and the service were very good. I would definitely recommend this place for Italian food lovers and steak lovers! My gnocchi was especially good, even though I would probably have liked a bigger portion considering the price!",4
Daughters birthday,5
Get the chicken parm!! It was absolutely amazing and I can't wait to have it again.,5
Hands down the best steak I've ever had! I would definitely recommend.,5
Great service and great food! Would recommend for a special occasion,5
The food is excellent. It's not cheap and it's not a traditional pasta house but it is well worth the time and money.,5
"Fantastic food, drinks and service. We will definitely be back!",5
My wife and I took our son out to dinner,5
for his 25th birthday. Sat in the upper level ,5
Food was great. Service was great. Wine was great. Anyone who complains about this place in my opinion is simply a moron. Hahaa,4
If you manage to have Julie look after you for the evening you're in for exceptional service.  She's an incredible asset to Quality Italian.   Thanks for always making our meal out special.,4
"Food is good but terribly expensive for what it is. The steak looked nice and was apparently very good but my salad was nothing outstanding, neither was the tuna coming with it.",5
"Service could be nicer, smile is rare, Feels like Peter Luger's bar if you can picture what I mean. Long story short, there are better options in the area.",4
Enjoyed the food and the service. Order arrived very quickly and staff were very friendly,4
"Everything was delicious and great presentation, Vibrant atmosphere - not good if you are looking for a quiet dinner.",5
THE BEST PORTERHOUSE MY HUSBAND AND I HAD!! THIS IS COMPARING IT TO THE ONE WE HAD IN VEGAS FOR DOUBLE THE PRICE! AMAZING FOOD AND GREAT PASTA!!! WILL GO AGAIN FOR SURE!,5
Great food and dining. Service was A+ as well!!!!!!,4
Wonderful! The food was amazing and service was amazing. Will def. go back!,3
The Dover Sole was AMAZING!!!,5
The food is excellent and this place is very expensive. We had a lovely birthday celebration here.,4
"The location was convenient to our hotel and we were able to get a reservation at a time that would allow us to make our show.   The food was good but not great.    The best way to describe it is nothing was notable, one way or another.   It was a decent meal but I didn't feel compelled to finish any of my courses (not even dessert!).   Service was very good and  the servers were very attentive.   The courses arrived with perfect timing.  The booth we sat in had tape covering tears in the leather seats but we joked it was just added ambience.   There was a piece of hair stuck to my husband's water glass but it was on the outside, so he just removed it.   For the price, I'd say the meal was mediocre.    If the pricing had been lower, I would have said it was good enough.  We won't eat there again unless we're in a bind and can't find a reservation elsewhere.  There's another Italian restaurant nearby that's much much better, in our experience.",3
"a bit spare/industrial inside, in a different location would have hip clientele but 57th/6th is expense account territory",5
Very busy on a Wednesday night.  Was disappointed that we had to wait almost 1/2 hour for our table when we had a reservation.,5
I love the food and typically the service is top notch!  But on this visit something crazy was going on and the bar and hostess stand was chaotic.  I had to wait over 30 mins for our reserved table and if I didn't consistently go to check I don't think I would have ever gotten seated.  ,5
I believe it's an anomaly as I've hosted several business meals and friend gatherings here in the past.  Hope they get their act together because if that happens again I will not be returning.,4
Chicken parm shaped and Cut like a pizza!,4
Added arugula honey and Parmesan toppings this was a taste sensation!,3
Plenty of other amazing options and a place to be seen!,5
"Consistently delicious and impeccable service. Restaurant went above and beyond to make special occasion memorable. In the dozens of times I've dined here since 2013, I've always enjoyed a stellar meal.",5
"Quality Italian never disappoints.  It is my go to spot,  when I have friends in from out of town and they ALWAYS love it.   The Chicken Parm for two is UNBELIEVABLE.   I am embarrassed to say that I have gone in ""alone"" just for that.   The good news is that is even better the next day.  ",5
Brunch is also amazing and surprisingly never packed.  Great place to spend a relaxing Sunday afternoon.,4
"The place was pretty good.  The food was B-, the physical menu was an awkward shape that made the 2-person table difficult to manage.  ",5
"The service was phenomenal, as was the presentation and ambiance.",2
"The hard seats really hurt my back, seats neee cushions",5
Overpriced for mediocre food and service.,5
"Hands down one of the best experiences I've had in NYC. Melissa and Ariel were amazing!! TJ puts out some epic dishes. I personally recommend the pork chop, the corn brûlée and the Tuscan fries.",5
I am so surprised the name seems weird but this place rocks !!! Love it thank u guys so much best food ever and I have been to Italy!! Service wow,2
Off the charts awesome.  Food is great and service is impeccable.  A great experience for New Yorkers as well as out of towners.  Don't have one negative comment.,2
"Chicken parm ""pizza"" is awesome.  Would love a few more dessert options.",5
"AMAZING FOOD!! Perfect ambiance and service. Will definitely be back soon! HIGHLY RECOMMEND: ""Chicken Parm for Two""",4
This is a happening place with a limited menu and quick service.  I had heard so much about it and I was very disappointed.  It was difficult to find something to eat and the food was very fair. I would not go back!,4
"Absolutely awesome place. The best service I have had at a NY restaurant. I believe his name was Brad, made us feel right at home as at first I was a little uncomfortable with the amount of ""businessmen"" in suits at the 5:05 reservation. I waited 2+ years for right time to go and try the Chicken Parm. And it was the most outrageous but down right delicious thing I have ever ate. I would recommend it to ALL! Cool place, great view, great service,  amazing food! Hats off to the chef!",5
Fabulous Meal!!,5
"5 in our party, and everyone's dinner was delicious.",5
Loved the chicken parm!  (Huge portion),5
"Starting with the great bartender Colin to the wait staff, everything was GREAT.",5
The food is amazing! 5 stars.,4
"Searched Zagats and chose Quality Italian because of the steakhouse type menu mixed with Italian food, very unique. ",4
My wife and I had a great time for our 7th Anniversary. We both agreed that Quality Italian has great food and is a happening spot. We thought we should bring a larger group of our family along the next time. ,5
"The only downside was we thought our food came out too quick. Fast is good, but too quick makes you feel like you are getting rushed out.",5
Went here Friday for my father's bday. Everything from start to finish was wonderful!! He loved it!!,5
Great experience. This was our second time dining here because we enjoyed it so much the first time. We have referred others and we plan on coming here again during our next stay in NYC.,2
"All dishes were excellent. Very buzzy atmosphere. We understand why it was recommended by a local contact, who is a regular.",5
Loved my evening here and was able to make an impression with my friend and,4
 my thousands of  social media followers were jealous LOL,4
Wish I had room to try more from the menu. Go with 6 people so you can get some of everything. Chicken Parm is a must. Artichoke Macaroni wonderful.,5
"We've been to some of the best restaurants in the world. Italian food is our weakness, and Quality Italian provides excellent food, wine and most of all, service. We had the Fusilli Alla Norma, Dry-Aged Porterhouse Agnilotti and the special Dover Sole. All highly recommend. And of course dessert - Ferrero Rocher and Coconut Stracchiatella gelatos (they're HUGE scoops - 1 of these is fine for 2 people - we recommend the coconut).",3
Underwhelmed unfortunately.  Menu unfulfilling and ambiance crowded and unappealing,4
I picked Quality Italian because of the great reviews and location.  After running the New York Marathon I was ready for a great meal and they delivered!  The complimentary bottle of wine for marathon finishers was totally unexpected and very generous.  I will race back to Quality Italian the very next visit to New York!,3
"My husband and I enjoyed a quality meal at Quality Italian.  The ambiance is energetic and the service is stellar. The food is pretty great too. I immensely enjoyed the angolotti appetizer. I'm a huge fan of homemade pasta and this was excellent. We enjoyed our steaks which I have to say are Flintstone size, huge! They had a hiccup in the kitchen and brought me the wrong cut of steak. They brought me the proper steak and gave us the wrong steak to take home. They also took the steak off the bill. We were satisfied with the resolution but they didn't stop there, they gave us free dessert. We each ordered a dessert and the restaurant gave us an extra one on the house too (in case you aren't counting 3 free desserts and 2 free steaks)!",2
Everyone agreed it was a delicious meal but hard to get out of the there for less than $150/person including tax and tip if you are doing 3 courses and drinks. Presentation is quite nice as well with their desserts and apps.,5
The name of the restaurant lowered my expectations. Usually if a business claims they are quality or the best or whatever I am disappointed. I wasn't this time. I loved the ambience. The staff and waiter was friendly and polished. They had great drinks and the chicken parm was delicious. Quality had a very interesting menu and I'd love to try the steaks at another time. A quality experience.,5
"Major disappointment.   3 out 4 streaks undercooked.   Waiter never stopped back to check on us, so no chance to get them adjusted.   Overall very poor service and lack of attention from waiter except to try to push a third bottle of wine on us.  Will not repeat.  A major step (or 3) down from its sister, Quality Meats.",5
"Went for a business lunch. Food and location were great - had been warned that it's s better for dinner but found the lunch menu to have many options and everything we had was delicious. Only issue was the service - interruptive and up selling at every opportunity. Even when my guest and I told our waiter that we didn't want any starters, thank you, he continued to push those as well as sides, desserts, etc. Expect this was an isolated incident but was still odd in that setting and something my guest and I both noticed, unfortunately.",4
"I've eaten here several times and I've never really been ""wowed"", yet I keep going back for the stunning atmosphere inside (especially for a midtown restaurant). If you eat meat it's a solid meal, but the service is spotty and the majority of the menu is underwhelming. This is definitely an expense account restaurant, very pricey. ",2
"With that said, it's a steak joint and the ""pork chop is the best I've ever had IN MY LIFE"" said my dining companion who licked his plate. Don't bother with the pastas (small portion, no flavor - I have tried them all), the sides and fish are good but super small portions, appetizers are all good and more worth it than the sides. Besides the pork chop, the veal milanese is delicious and can feed two people.",5
the noise level in this place is unbearable. some of the food was passable but for the prices one would expect far more and ambience that one could enjoy instead of being thrown into an atmosphere where you could not hear what your dining partner was saying. The service was unacceptably slow as well -- a total no-go,4
"What a wonderful surprise - I had heard great things about the dinner at Q.I., but the brunch was phenomenal!  The setting is gorgeous, quiet, and intimate.  The eggplant parmesan benedict is just to die for.  Also shared some monkey bread and a side of pancetta with friends and indulged in a spiced pear bellini.  For a special occasion brunch, this is the place.",5
"This restaurant never disappoints. Quality of food and service is always great. Met the new GM, Kevin Dillon-super nice guy!",3
My husband and I went for lunch and our meals were amazing from beginning to end the service was above any expectations.,5
The food is fantastic despite the high prices. They have the best baked clams i have ever had. The steak was to die for. I am not too fond of dinning on 57st. The crowd at QI makes the ambience feel uptight and boring but the food made it all worth it.,5
food was definitely NOT Italian in origin or preparation.,3
although it was more than edible.,4
"do not go expecting Italian food, mostly the same steaks, chops, seafood and sides prepared at Quality Meats around the corner, but not as good.",4
"Went here for lunch to catch up with an old friend. At noon it was quiet and not busy but by 1 the place was full and buzzing yet never too loud to have a conversation. Our salads, which were nice but nothing exceptional, came very quickly so we were finished eating before we finished chatting! I asked our very nice waiter if we could sit and visit for a while longer and he was delighted to let us do so. BTW there were gorgeous plates of seafood and shellfish being served all around us... Definitely would like to go again for a splurge!",5
"Hard to find, the full dining area is on the 2nd floor at the corner...as its name suggests, its quality food but not as much Italian as I thought. The 24oz steak (for lunch) is notable, although was told it was a tomahawk steak so much of the 24oz is bone. Excellent overall spot.",5
"Went there for our anniversary dinner. Food was outstanding: the specials for the day were a giant crab claw (appetizer) which was enough to share for two and exceptional, as was the bone-in filet. Service was fast, very polite and professional without being overbearing. When the restaurant filled up, it definitely got noisy, because it's a big room. We didn't mind, but something to keep in mind if you want to have a quiet dinner/serious conversation. Also, for those who expect a more traditional ""Italian"" line up: it's still a steak house first, yet with an Italian twist. Love the ambiance, though I'm an even bigger fan of the sister restaurant, Quality Meats. Definitely would be back because of the food and the service.",4
"Quality Italian is a superior kitchen in a neighborhood of mediocre tourist spots. The 2nd floor room is handsome and the tables aren't too close, making it seem good for a business lunch. But the room is all hard surfaces and the noise level made it impossible to have a conversation. Service was only fair; we were rushed to order, two dishes came with ingredients missing (croutons on salads which were touted in the salads' description), and two different waiters tried to take coffee orders. For that matter, we lost track of how many different servers we dealt with. The reward is the food: perfectly prepared, great flavor, beautiful presentation. I'd go back but only for a quieter table by the window or at off-hours for a quieter room.",3
"If you've been to Quality Italian's sister site, Quality Meats, expect more of the same goodness with a twist. The atmosphere, service and food is all top notch. My date and I went with famous chicken parm that was off the charts and had two sides — corn creme brulee and sauteed spinach. The corn was a bit too sweet this go around but that's kind of par for the course with a creme brulee-inspired dish. For dessert if you skip the signature lemon tart you're doing yourself a disservice. ",5
Will be recommending this to family and friends as the their next go-to spot.,4
Cannot say enough about this place. The manager Mike was at the top of his game. Responsive and customer oriented. I worked with him and his staff to organize a set menu for my party of 12 and he was a pleasure to work with. The food was fresh and delicious and our wait staff was lovely and professional. My guests had a great time and left raving about the dinner.,4
Delicious steak and great sides. E pensive but really worth it.,5
The Lobster salad is my favorite ever sans proscuitto.,5
"Loved the food, DJ outing out choons was fantastic too. Shame about our server though. She let down what could have been a 5 star night.",4
"Great steaks. Good service. It's a shame that the DJ plays the music SO FRICKIN' LOUD that you can't hear each other at your table. Kind of ridiculous, really. This was our second time trying the restaurant. The first time, we couldn't stand the volume so we left before ordering. This time, we endured, although our legs were shaking from the bass beat reverberating under our table.",3
"As great as my bone-in fillet was, I don't know that I or my 4 dinner mates will ever return to STK.",3
Loud. Wait.... make that VERY loud. From the incessant thumping of the dance music to the loud conversations at nearby tables this is not a place that lend itself toward getting to know your dining companions. The food is good and the service quite adequate.,5
"Given my druthers I can think of a number of better places to eat red meat in NYC but, hey, if you don't mind the scene and relish the close proximity to Bryant Park for an after dinner walk to work off that meal you've just had then I'd say it's a worthy choice.",5
I really enjoy my dining experience here because the food and atmosphere are modern and satisfy my New York expectations. The DJ seems to find that perfect mix of music to appeal to all clientele . I would recommend STK to friends who are difficult to please.,4
"Delicious fun trendy modern excellent decor Meatpacking style. This is usually an after work spot. By 10:30pm on a summer Wednesday, things started to die down.",4
"Compared to other upscale Manhattan lunch places this restaurant provides a really cool atmosphere and diverse menu options. While a bit pricey, the food was good, portions were satisfying (I had the lobster cobb salad and could not finish the plate) and the presentation was great.",5
"Food is surprising good for the type of place. I have eaten here three times, and have NEVER been seated on time. A 30 minute delay is not uncommon. So, if your time-poor and need to move quickly, avoid this place. Otherwise, Catch is a good addition to the neighborhood.",5
"Fabulous find for beef foodie, impossible to please! His quest for the best may have ended here. Obviously got the beef but the sides, salad, wine, and desert were equally awesome! And don't miss their signature cocktails, the Wild Orchard and Cucumber potion were delish. But credit for the experience must go to MICHAEL our brilliant server who made the suggestions and provided superb service. Finally the atmosphere is inviting and energetic w/top notch DJ spinning throughout dinner hours adding to the ambience. Dress up for the main dining area or down w/smart casual and ask for the bar area. Definitely recommend and will be our go to place when in the city. Stake out STK-NYC soon!!",5
Staff was incredible! We are from Texas and love our steak but this was the best filet my husband and I have ever had!,2
Very attentive service with such a friendly touch. The manager was hands on and spent several minutes visiting with us. Actually sat down to join us in conversation. We would definitely return when back in town.,5
"They seemed to have lowered the DJ music volume which is SUCH a good idea. Previously, way too loud. Friday nite noise level PERFECT for that kind of restaurant scene!!!",5
"This place is simply not worth it - the dining room is beautiful and the service is stellar, but the quality of the food and drink is subpar. You are much better off anywhere else in Midtown if you appreciate value and good eats.",5
Cool place to have a steak or take a younger fun crowd for a nice dinner.,5
"My husband and I went for a Saturday night dinner. After reading a few mixed reviews we were not sure what to expect. We had a blast! The food was excellent, service was decent, and the music was a great bonus! If you want to go somewhere fun and tasty, this is your spot!",3
A perfect place to dine and still leave you in the mood to go out after.,3
I went to STK Midtown for the first time with my date who has been numerous times. I was not sure what to expect but have heard great things. I was happy with the immediate sitting even though we were close to ten minutes late for our reservation. We were initially seated by the fireplace and it was too hot. The host moved us immediately. The bread was great and our skirt steaks were cooked to perfection just how we ordered them. I of course had the key lime tart for dessert and was in heaven!!! Definitely going back!!!!,5
Took the girl here for her birthday. Couldn't have asked for better food and ambiance. Highly recommeneded for a special occasion.,4
"Let's be frank... you come here to ""people"" watch and to get a little night life during dinner. The food is good, but there's many steak houses in NYC that are much better (Del Frisco's) and moderately better (Uncle Jack's). The appetizers were solid (Heirloom Tomatoes and Shrimp Krispies), but the steak (10 oz filet) did not have as much flavor as the restaurants measured above and the sides were mediocre at best. The server was just ""OK"". I would go back, but I wouldn't rush back.",4
Is it a prerequisite for the staff to be outright rude and condescending? Thank god the food is tasty.,4
I really enjoy STK and once again it didn't disappoint. The food was wonderful and the energy was great. I love the martinis and the steaks are killer.,3
"Great location in midtown, vibrant bar. The tables for 2 are v close together and if this is something that prevents a really romantic spot. The host at one point in the evening leaned on my chair to talk to another party. They also appeared in a rush towards the end, because when I said no to dessert the bill suddenly appeared! ...,",2
"Loved my steak at STK, I had the petite filet. The space itself is very modern and beautifully decorated.... I went with my grandparents and was nervous that it might be a bit too loud, but it ended up being perfect. The only annoying thing is that the steaks do not come with anything, you have to order separate sides to go with your entree.",5
nice romantic atmosphere trendy but very expensive food was okay,4
Music was very nice,4
The food was excellent though menu was limited. How can a steakhouse not have a baked potato? The waitress was very sweet but on everything we ordered she told us the chef is very particular & a prima donna & would resist any changes. This happened multiple time. It is our feeling the chef is being asked to accomodate a paying patron & should have been more amenable to slight adjustments. We didn't stay for dessert as we didnt want to hear the same story. How would they ever accomodate a person with allergies? It would have been nice if the manager had interceded as we would not go back there to be harassed about changes when the prices were higher than comparable steakhouses in the area.,4
I wish the menu had more of a selection and was more appealing to everyone. The vibe was a bit snobby. They could really improve by being more accommodating to their customers.,3
Great pre-broadway show dinner. Food excellent. Drinks excellent. Service perfect. Absolutely love the decor and the tables are great little half moon booths that are perfect for a dinner-for-two. Loved the restaurant and the food.,4
"We really enjoyed our visist to STK. Our waitress, Diana was fantastic. The only negative was sitting at a table in the front of the restaurant. The bar was over crowded and people were standing with drinks hanging over a ledge near diners; they were loud and distracting. We wish the management staff would have asked the patrons to move back intot he bar area or somewhere else. If you plan to go to STK for a romantic dinner, request a table in teh area past the bar - the ambiance and tables are much nicer.",5
"Food, attention and service were outstanding, but the DJ's thumping house music will ensure you will not have a conversation with your significant other.",5
"I first experienced STK in Miami, which I have to say was better but this STK was beautiful and delicious nonetheless. The only thing I would suggest is that the restaurants staff not be so keen on clearing plates and food dishes because it makes you feel rushed or your food gets taken away without you even finishing it. Otherwise, our waiter was friendly, helpful, and we had a great time.",5
"nice restaurant with a cool interior. service was soso. there was a mistake in our order, i did not raise a big fuss - it was what it was. our waiter could care less. Saving grace: the manager came over on her own and was VERY accomodating. the manager made all the difference. she comp'd us a desert tray. waiter received an C- grade; manager received an A+. Although a nice restaurant, I would recommend a same price point restaurant in the area first - del friscos, sparks, quality meats, etc. Kudos to the manager tho :) Side note: truffle fries were very nice.skip the foi gras butter - its reeeeeeal light on the foi gras ;)",1
"First time we dined at STK. Made reservations for a pre-theater dinner. Host and wait staff were extremely conscious and considerate of our time constraint. Service was impeccable. Efficient and not rushed. Food was very good -- straight-forward, not overly fussy, but well prepared and tasty. We'd definitely go back.",5
Food was great. Service was great!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤,4
"I was a little worried after having read some other reviews. I have been to STK in the Meatpacking distrct many times, this was my first time at the mid town location. Staff was friendly and attentive. The food was great. Just as good as lower NYC.",2
"The food was outstanding. Ordered the lil'burgers, they were very good. Steak was perfectly done and the sider of broccolini was to die for. The service was perfect, not too much but was there whenever we needed it. The ambiance was well done. The music was loud but I enjoyed it quite throughly. Overall, it was a great time with excellent food.",4
"I have been to STK in the meat packing district and Las Vegas. It is one of my favorite restaurants. STK midtown is no comparison. STK is usually a lively fun place with great drinks and food, and a fabulous DJ. I had difficulty getting a cab so I called 15 minutes before my reservation, they told me they could not hold a table for me. When I got there, all stressed out, the restaurant was 1/2 empty. Then they sat me by the kitchen door, even though there were plenty of tables.The waiter rushed us. we asked for steamed veggies with no butter, to told us he can't give special request to kitchen. One guest was vegan and He told her to get a starter salad. The experience just continued miserable from there.I was embarrassed.",5
EXCELLENT AS ALWAYS. ONE OF OUR FAVORITE RESTAURANTS IN THE CITY.,5
Excellent restaurant! One of our favorites...the food is terrific and the atmosphere is exciting! The lemon cake is absolutely amazing!!,3
Over rated!,2
Service- The waiter took 30 minutes just to acknowledge and say hi to us after we sat. The bus boy gave us a nice warm bread with butter and no utensils on the table.,5
"Ambiance- thanks to Open Table, they honored my table request by the window. We got a better spot than others.",4
"Food- Over rated! I had better steak @ Outback. The quality of the meat wasn""t worth the price of what we paid for. We both ordered Prime Ribeye medium cooked.",4
"Prices- Stella beer was $9, Shiraz was $11 glass, side order was $12 &up, main course $43. Blah!",4
"Food is amazing, truly the best steakhouse in Manhattan.",5
"Unbelievably crowded. But one of the best steaks I've had in NYC, great space and service was excellent.",2
"Excellent food and service, get there early because it gets crowded. The only down side of my dining experience was the over priced wine however it will be our first stop the next time we're in the neighborhood.",4
"Del Frisco's was more sophisticated than our usual restaurant, but they catered to our 9 and 11 year old kids without missing a beat. The food was good, although the portions are absurdly outsized. Service was impeccable.",3
Service was super friendly and efficient. Great staff and the view from our table on the second floor was superb! Food was perfect. Will definitely recommend to others. Thank you for our best New York dining experience!,5
"Inattentive service. Forgotten side dishes. Food not up to standard of high end steakhouse. We had a 6:00 reservation and they tried to seat us in a side room at 6:15. We asked to move to the main room and were seated by 6:30. We told the waiter we had an 8:00 show. He assured us we had plenty of time, but we ended up making it only because we asked for the check as soon as our main dishes arrived at 7:20. One steak was not prepared as ordered and the waiter forgot one of the side dishes. The restaurant seemed to be understaffed, as the waiter was doing the water pouring and other tasks usually done by busboys. We would never go back.",4
"Can't say enough about the quality of the food or service. A very extensive AND expensive wine list. As good as the meal was, it probably falls short in terms of it being a reasonable value. It was clearly a hot spot for corporate types with expense accounts, and the prices reflected that understanding. That said, we would still go back.",5
"Great steak served with distinction. Excellent service when one got to the table, but not so good at reception. Overall worth the visit.",3
"As always, Del Friscos is a great place to celebrate a special occassion. Being in the heart of Manhattan and looking out on the avenue, Radio City Music Hall and Rockefeller Center is an amazing treat. The food is spectacular at Del Friscos. Dinner can be a bit pricey, but if it's a special occassion--why not?",4
Steak was a little tough but very flavorfull. Great location and they gave us a table with an outdoor view as requested. I was very impressed with that. The prices are high however. I think you get more for your money at Ruth's but you can't beat this location.,4
Our favorite Manhattan restaurant!,4
"WE booked the table for 10 pm and it was ready at 11 pm, that's too long if you are hungry. Meat was great!",3
We appreciated that we had our table in a more quiet sideroom; it was very cozy and we had the opportunity to talk without being disturbed because of too much noise. The service was very good. In the beginnig we were told what special options we have. Here in germany so far I have not been to a steak house of that class. It was recommended by a good friend of mine and I must say he was absolutely right.,5
"Food was very good. Crab cake,Steak, and Spinach were memorable. Wine List was overwhelming even by region.",5
"One of the best steaks I have had with a noisy,vibrant ambiance and excellent service. Highly recommended",4
My wife and I consider Del Frisco's our favorite steakhouse. I even have been to the other Del Frisco's in other locations. This was the first time where a dinner cut was terrible. They did handle it quickly by offering a different type of dinner which was great.,5
"Excellent food, service & ambiance - my favorite upscale steak house",5
This was our families first time at Delfrisco's and it so much better then Ruth Chris' and may have been a notch better then Peter Luger's. They food was delicious.,2
"Excellent as always. I was a little surprised that I was not asked if I'D like to wrap the untouched half of my double eagle steak , half of both sides and the dessert that wasnt even three quarters full. I left with an odd feeling believing that my left overs would be brought to the table, yet only received the bill and a sincere thank you after giving the check.",5
Excellent staff- very efficient and pleasant. The businessman's lunch was terrific and very resonably priced,4
Good overall but the steak was really perfect .,4
i don't understand why we could not be seated until we had all the members.,1
terrific restaurant. Food was pricey but delicious. Very festive. Great location.,2
excellent service and wonderful food. A little noisy but otherwise very nice. Have eaten there many times and food is always consistently good.,5
This is by far my favorite Steak house! The decor is breathtaking with their impressively high floor to ceiling windows. We've dined at Del Frisco's many times and have made it a tradition to come during Christmas so we can walk up the block and see the tree at Rockerfeller center. The crabcakes and shrimp roumalade are appetizer musts! The pineapple infused vodka is a great cocktail to enjoy and the large wine list is impressive (personally love their reisling wine and have been searching for it ever since in wine stores!) The creme brulee and chocolate soufle are to die for!,4
"My party of 4 was kept waiting 40 minutes beyond reservation time (6:30 PM Tuesday night) in a terribly small, loud and crowded ""lobby"" area - reservation had been made 4 weeks in advance! Then squashed around a table that was literally touching the adjacent table. One Porterhouse steak, ordered rare, was truly inedible due to gross over-salting. Restaurant far too crowded and too loud, could not hear any conversation without literally shouting. These guys are trying to squeeze out maximum marginal earnings, to the detriment of customer experience. A disastrous dining experience that spoiled our very special occasion.",2
"My reservation was for 6:15PM and I arrived early. I was told to notify them when all the members arrived, which I did at 6:20PM. The young lady told me I will be seated shortly. After an hour of waiting (standing) and checking multiple times on the status of the reservation, I was told the same story over and over. I decided to wait closer to the reservation desk where I noticed 6:30 and 6:45 appointments being seated. Perhaps it was because I was not a frequent visitor (these parties seemed to know the gentleman behind the desk). This was the first bad experience I had with OPEN TABLE in regards to a reservation not being honored. I have been P.L, Capital Grill, Angelo&Maxies, Ben/Jacks and have never been treated in this manner.",3
THE WAITRESS WAS VERY NICE AND TOOK EXTRA TIME TO EXPLAIN THINGS ON THE MENU FOR US HER,5
NAME WAS CAROLEE.,5
"Food was very good. Best piece of meat I've ever had. With reservation had only a little wait. Prices very high, count on no less than $100 per person when including tip and do share a dessert. Probably the holidays, but it was way too noisy and crowded.",3
overpriced!  more fit for business expense dinner,3
"food and service were very good, noise level was deafening and very offputting, couldn't hear guests at the same table unless they sat next to you. People across the table had to raise their voices significantly to be heard.",5
Good food and a great time as usual.,1
Absolutely terrific yet expensive restaurant. Top notch steakhouse.,5
"Great restaurant with lots of energy. The music was a bit loud which made casual conversaton difficult on the 2nd floor, but the overall experience was outstanding.",5
"We had a reservation for 8:15pm, but we weren't seated until 9:00pm. The hostess station was chaotic, people who were leaving were crowded with the people who were coming in, the downstairs bar was over crowded, as was the upstairs bar. But the food was good, steak was good. Sides were OK, nothing spectacular.",3
steak was juicy and very delicious but moreover sidedish vegetables like spinach and potato were exceptionally good. They were served very hot and hot plate kept dishes tasty to the end.,4
"Dessert, icecream with strawberry and cognac was excellent as well.",4
"Truly upscale and absolutely lovely, though pricey, the tab was not outrageous for fine steaks and service. We certainly were impressed with just about all of the staff's desire to get things just right. The one bummer was that there apparantly was a sport event being shown on TV in their bar, which was within earshot . . . and whenever a goal, basket, whatever was made, our ears really did get shot. Since we're not sports bar fans, we'll realy need to think hard about another visit.",4
"Our steaks were delicious, as was everything else. But the portions are gigantic (in fact larger than desired) and therefore the prices are also quite high.",5
"Although our reservation was delayed, we enjoyed a coctail in the bar area. When seated, our waitress arrived promptly, discussed the menu and upon hearing that we had theatre reservations, expedited our order. The food was fantastic! The service even better. Our only regret was that we had to leave before desert or coffee in order to make our theatre time.",5
The best steak I have ever had!,5
"I went for my birthday, it was my first time at Del Frisco's and I look forward to go back! Great service and the food is amazing too! Make sure to have reservations before you go.",5
"Great steakhouse. I have been there on a few occassions and it has always been excellent. The food was outstanding, the filet I had was cooked to perfection. The atmosphere was energetic, and my date and I had a table in a nice secluded section of the resturant where we were able to enjoy quiet conversation. The staff was tremendous, very friendly and responsive. Overall a very enjoyable experience and I will be going back again in the future.",3
"We were a group of 5 and had made a reservation for 7.45 PM on a Thursday night. We had the surprise to be seated before finishing our drinks. The meat was excellent and perfectly cooked, a bit salty though (maybe the cook is in love..).",5
I will defintely fo back !,4
"This is clearly one of the best steak places in NYC. Had one of the best Bone-in Ribeyes in my life. Great service and wine selection. Also, I noticed they have a very attractive client base that dines there.",5
none better for impressing a client. Always impecable service,5
"we were a group of 6 , running late and they hold the reservation for 1 hr with out a problem.",4
excellent suggestions from the waiter: steak trio,5
excellent steak! and desserts!,5
I definitely recommend this place.,4
THE BEST STEAKHOUSE IN ALL OF NEW YORK CITY AND NATIONWIDE.,5
Very tasty food... only con is noise!,4
I recommend Del Frisco's to ALL of my friends and everyone I speak to that I know that is looking for a resturant in NYC. I have been going for 4 years and will never go to any other steak house in New York. I love this resturant and would like to thank the staff for the pleasant atmosphere and excellent service.,5
"friendly persons, with waiter who suggest without any pressure, and very very good food",4
Excellent steaks on New Years Eve - but served nearly cold! But service handled this problem in a very professional way! Therefor I will recommend Del Frisco also in the future.,5
"Me and three friends had dinner for New Years at Del Frisco's. The food was really outstanding, everything was perfectly cooked. It might be the best steak I've ever had, no kidding.",5
"Huge wine list (more like a book than a list)! Great atmosphere, service was really good and perfect location (just a block from times sq). I will definitly be back!",5
"nice room, very nice view. Friendly staff. Food good, however i would expect more from a restaurant this level.",4
"Was a great experience, excellent meal.",4
"great steaks, good sides, very noisy, can barely hear your friends",4
"My meal at Del Frisco's was fantastic. The staff was courteous, friendly and professional. The food was fantastic. I brought two friends who had recently gotten married, and Del Frisco's was kind enough to provide a complimentary celebratory dessert and champagne flute. It was a perfect conclusion to a wonderful meal.",5
"Great table and skilled and fine service. A special night made more special by Rachel, our fabulous server!! Great steaks and great apps and sides with a relaxed and skilled service staff.",5
"Absolutely loved the restaurant! We celebrate our anniversary some where different in NYC every 12/30 after visiting The Tree in Rockefeller center, so this was our first time at your restaurant celebrating. It won't be our last! The wine was delicious, the service was outstanding and the atmosphere was energetic. Keep up the good work!!",3
"Very nice wait staff to explain all the specials and food options. Not suitable for vegetarians, however, this site works with a strictly kosher restaurant to provide kosher options to those dining alongside others who don't keep kosher.",5
excellent steak and side,4
great wine list with fine european and american wines,4
service very friendly,2
The restaurant is just beautiful with a double-height ceiling.The people working there are so helpful and the work-staff are THE GREATEST!! Great place for a quick and good and solid meal near Radio City Music Hall.,5
"This is my third time at Del Frisco's, each time over the holidays. If you're into steaks, this is the place. I had the strip steak which was done just as I ordered. The sides are sufficient for 2 people but probably not much more than that. Service was attentive given the time of year and the number of tables. I would strongly recommend this restaurant and plan on going back next year.",3
I picked Del Frisco (NYC) due to a visit to their Dallas restaraunt many years ago. My memory (fresh baked bread) didn't let me down; as good as Ruth Chris and/or Morton's in my book!,5
"In visiting one of my favorite steakhouses, I came across on my second visit a lack of precision as I received in the past. I ordered an aged bone in 32oz steak and specifically asked for well done and no red or pink in the middle. I received a steak that was done medium well with red in the middle. This was surprising since the last time I visited this place everything was perfect. Service people causally walked by and since we were seated in the corner, I felt their attention was not as equally shared as those around us. I will still continue to visit my favorite steakhouse and hope that the 3rd trip will be a more delight for my taste senses and also avoid the blizzard that was going on outside.",4
I have coming to Del Frisco's NYC since 2012.  It has been a must while in NYC.,3
"Still a pretty good establishment, but I have noticed the food quality go down as of late.  My last two visits were disappointing from a food perspective.  Steak was not as tender and very under cooked, sides were sloppy in appearance and salads look tired.",3
Just an FYI from a loyal customer.,5
Will probably not visit Del Frisco's the next time I am in NYC.  I will probably try another steak house.,5
"Very disappointing wagu beef experience. It had a tendon running across the cut, and had a chewy texture. Not that as tender as expected.",5
"Always a good place to go! Service was great, they noted that a birthday celebration was the occasion and the waiter and servers signed a birthday card. Very thoughtful.",5
"Sam our server made our anniversary memorable and special...he was attentive, knowledgeable,and made sure everything that we ordered was perfect.",5
Awsome  in every aspect,5
Great meal and outstanding service.  My waiter was very helpful and prompt and made it a very relaxing and enjoyable evening.  Will definitely recommend to friends and will return again myself.,4
"I come here with my boyfriend every October for his traditional birthday dinner. Eric G is the best waiter! Funny, attentive and very informative and knowledgeable of the menu while offering his personal opinions as well! Would love to request him as our waiter again next time. Aside from the great service here the food is literally to die for...you owe it to yourself to eat here. Worth every penny!",3
"I have been to Del Frisco's several times over the years, the last time being about 3 years ago.  I always liked this restaurant very much, but I was surprised at how much better it became since my last visit.  It is now my favorite steakhouse.  We arrived on time for our reservation.  Although the restaurant was packed, my wife and I were seated by a very friendly hostess immediately.  As soon as we sat down, we were provided with water, bread, the wine list and the menu.  The wine list is extensive and fairly priced, containing a huge selection of both half-bottle and full-bottle formats.  We skipped the appetizers in favor of ordering the 12 ounce filet mignon, the 32 ounce Waygu Tomahawk Chop and the 16 ounce lobster tail to split.  We also ordered the onion rings and the spaghetti squash.  The portions were large, too much to be consumed by two people, so we had an excellent dinner at home the next evening.  ",5
"Both steaks were perfectly cooked medium rare as requested.  The Waygu Tomahawk Chop was perfectly marbled and could have been sliced with a butter knife.  The filet mignon was the most tender filet I have tasted in years.  The lobster tail was huge, meaty and as sweet as can be.  Many steakhouses give short shrift to their sides.  However, not Del Frisco's.  The onion rings were perfectly cooked and bathed in a delicious batter before being deep fried.  Crispy as can be, yet not at all greasy. The spaghetti squash was also delicious, bathed in an unctuous concoction of cream, cheese and pistachio nuts (not meant for dieters).  We were too full to even consider desert.",5
Our server was excellent.  She was very knowledgable about the menu and specials.  She was on top of everything from the time we walked in until the time we left.  She anticipated every need before we know that we need it.  Her timing was perfect.,2
"The steak was great, but the service was not very good. Our entrees were served to us rudely and we asked the waiter to cut it nicely, but all they did was slice the steaks in the middle and left. I think Del Frisco is the only steakhouse that did not complete a request of this sort.",4
Seared ahi was barely seared and cold on the inside. The service was terrible. Waiter barely paid attention to us,5
The restaurant is extremely close to Radio City and Rockefeller Center. Great ambiance.  The staff is very attentive.  Our steaks were cooked to our request. The salad and side vegetables,5
 were  enough for us to share.  The birthday dessert was a surprise from the restaurant.  ,5
Although a bit pricey it was well worth it.  I would go back and do recommend it for special occasions .  I would suggest reservations depending on the time you arrive.  It seemed empty when I arrived but was filled up by the time we left.,5
Food was amazing! NY Strip and Alaskan King Crab...soooo good.,5
Started by giving us a crappy table.  Asked to move but were told they we full.  Food overpriced for the quality and it was extremely loud.  Last time I ever go there for a meal.  Plenty of other good steak places.,4
The service is terrific! The place is VERY noisy.,5
"Amazing food reasonably priced...grest atmosphere , staff very friendly and attentive to our needs....overall great experience",5
Fabulous steaks; great service! I will be back and would recommend to everyone!,4
Waitress Yolan was Great!!!!,3
"We LOVE Del Frisco's, so I surprised my hubby with a birthday dinner last night.  And again, what a wonderful experience ! First off huge shout out to our waitress Amy; she was TOTALLY AMAZING !  Super knowledgeable, sweet, outgoing and a pleasure; she gave my hubby a ""birthday feast"" to remember ! Steak = THE best ever. We were seated downstairs in a booth facing the windows; it was perfect ! Thank you guys for ANOTHER amazing night. Can't wait to come back !",4
"Outstanding summarizes the overall experience.  The service was fantastic, good mixed cocktails and the steaks were cooked perfectly. We enjoyed the lobster mac n cheese but found the lobster bisque with a real heavy hand of pepper.",5
Not as great as first time we ate there. Seemed like staff was hurried and could not take care of us with attention to details.  I am thinking it was just a bad night. Steak was excellent.,5
Great night. This place never disappoints. Service and food are top notch.,5
"DelFriscos is my favorite restaurant in NY. The crowds at the bar and the full yables every day indictate its the place to be for business get togethers or pre theatre.  It never disappoints. The food is amazing and the service is exceptional. Its a bit pricey,  ut well worth it",5
Good the dried steak so yummy !,5
"The room temperature was too warm. The noise level was too high for a business discussion. The Somm brought the wrong bottle of wine and insisted the one I ordered was not available so I accepted it. But later I asked again and found that is WAS available. (The one I wanted was $175,  the one be brought was $80 and disappointing.  So it was not an upsell, but rather a lack of knowledge about his inventory.)",5
"Very good as usual.  Quality of the steaks and other dishes is high and very consistent. Remains at the top of the list of the many steakhouses in NY. Not cheap, but in line with its peers.  Only complaint is the usual 5-10 minute wait to be seated while standing in cramped quarters near the bar.",5
"Proposed to my girlfriend here. Spoke with both daytime and nighttime managers to help me through the process. All of the staff were amazingly helpful. My waiter made the night perfect for me and my fiancé. Everything I needed, they were able to accommodate. The food was amazing and the night was perfect. Absolutely no complaints.",5
"My boyfriend and I came here for dinner Saturday night. Everything was impeccable--from the ambience, to the food, to the service. Our waiter, Christian, was extremely knowledgeable and attentive. Our entrees were cooked perfectly (filet mignon and the 14 day dry aged lamb). Expensive meal, but worth every penny in my opinion. Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area.",5
Amazing evening! I surprised my fiance for her birthday. The lobster mashed potatoes are a MUST! The seared sea bass was delicious.  The Celebration Desert is also a MUST! Our experience was well worth every dollar spent! Excellent staff and management.,4
"Had a great time at Del Frisco's! Our server Sarah, was exceptional! The restaurant sweetly provided my boyfriend with a Happy Birthday card, and a Happy Birthday dessert display that was as delicious as it was beautiful! Definitely will return.",5
"Had an Excellent meal.  10 of us for dinner celebrating a bachelor party.   Our server Kelly was fantastic.  Attentive, fast, very knowledgeable about the menu and gave great suggestions.  A-plus food, service and drinks.",4
Well run NYC gem.  Steaks and wine list are great.  Staff is well trained and looking to please.  Sides are also very good and worth a try.  The specials are always on the mark.,5
Food and service second to none. Pricey but truly enjoyed ourselves,4
Our waiter Chris was exceptional .  We loved the view of the Radio City area.,4
"Wonderful service, excellent food, super accommodating since we had 2 children with us. Certainly worth going for the business lunch ... excellent food!!",5
"Avviversary celebration...absolutely fabulous dining experience. Great wine list, awesome lamb & halibut! Highly recommend!",5
White wine not properly chilled and you need to ask for it (even on a hot NYC summer day). Not consistent with having one of the most expensive wine lists around. Wine serving also a bit hurried and casual.,2
The way to do it is to have an ice bucket at the table so you can see the bottle.,4
1970s decor not ideal,5
"When reservation was made I requested a quiet table, since it was a client meeting.Had the hotel concierge call to confirm several hours prior-Both requests were ignored, we were put at table dead center of the walk way entrance in the restaurant.We asked to be moved & were-did NOT appreciate having to ask with client present.Service was poor, wait person had a large table & 2 young drinking females he was far more attentive to.After entrees were served, server never returned until it was time to present check,someone else cleared table brought desert menus & took order.Spoke to mngmt at end was told service shouldn't have been bad & they moved us when we asked they'd put a note in computer for our next visit.",2
"I've bee to Marea a couple of times over the years. I must say, I was impressed the first time I dined there around two years ago. The service, food and ambiance was lovely. Over the years Marea remained one of my top choices for dining out, however this past  Sunday we had lunch there with my family and something seemed off. The scene was different, the service a bit sluggish and the decor somewhat poor. The food was ok, desert disapointing, except for bomboloni. Don't know if I'll go again in the near future.",5
"One of the best meals in New York to date for me. The food was impeccable (highly recommend the lobster and burrata starter and the lump crab with chilli pasta). The sommelier was very helpful and knowledgable and chose a wine that was perfect for what we were having. The wine list is very interesting and complete - we only thought it was a bit weak when it came to Spanish whites, but otherwise great. The only minor complaint would be from our femaile server who told us that we should not have put olive oil on a small metal plate which she went to clean and then literally threw onto our table with a very rude gesture which left us a bit surprised. Apart from this rude behaviour from the female server, the other servers where very attentive and helpful. By the way, we had oyster as well and they were perfect.",4
Great !! Excelent cooking and presentation,5
"I was really disappointed in the food. It was OK, not great. I was expecting an outstanding meal, but although it was imaginative, it ended up being fairly average, consistent with an average priced restaurant. Maybe I hit a bad night. My wife had the same sentiment. Service and atmosphere were excellent",5
"We were extremely pleased with every aspect of our meal.  The food was wonderful, we did the prefix so that we could taste a little bit of everything.  The service was very professional....attentive without being overwhelming.  The location right on the park was very nice.  The decor was upscale and classic modern.",5
Top drawer.   The food was excellent.  The deserts to die for,4
"Amazing, as always. The Michelin stars are well-deserved.",4
"Went with my wife on a Friday night. Service was friendly and accommodating from the moment we walked in. I had the bone-in sirloin which was delicious, perfect temp. my wife had the steak tartare which was equally tasty. Solid wine list. The lighting and interior design add to the dining experience, which is rare for a NY steakhouse. One drawback: we got a table upstairs off on our own but most of the tables for 2 are in a row right on top of each other which I find annoying. However, overall a very enjoyable evening.",4
"Appetizer of seared scallops with corn and bacon was divine, though small portion. Bread was very fresh, though I found a little too salty.",4
"We ordered the dry aged porterhouse for two which was for the most part extremely tender - edges could be a little less crunchy. Medium was closer to medium-rare, so beware!",4
Ice cream was very nice...I tried the special flavor on the day (blueberry cheesecake) which was generous with the berries but could have been less sweet.,5
"At least in the section we sat in, the place was packed for a Wednesday night and it was difficult to hold a conversation. Tables were placed very close making entry/exit tricky - though some people were making new friends with each other!",5
"Other then the overseasoned steak (which was excellent nonetheless) Quality Meats certainly upholds the Fourth Wall experience. All of my standards and expectations were met and exceeded. As a chef mysef, I appreciated the food with enthusiasm, even the steak sauce which I generally do not care for. I will certainly be a repeat customer, and plan on bringing some of my clients here for a night out. Thank you, Quality Meats, for an exceptional evening.",5
Our evening was really delightful. The restaurant served first rate food with lovely surprises woven throughout. We are still talking about it.,5
"Everything was fantastic!! I had been there before with a two others, and this time there were 14 of us. Out of all that food, only one order was slightly overcooked (very impressive). The Tuna Le Bernadine was absolutely amazing--probably one of the best things I have ever put in my mouth. The creamed spinach and the skillet potatoes were A+ as well. The sirloin is the way to go, but the filet was so tender it falls apart in your mouth. Overall, great place to celebrate!",5
The food was excellent and the sommelier was knowledgeable and helpful. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a top dining experience. The rib steak was particularly good.,4
"Awesome food, great service! We really enjoyed and can't wait to go back.",2
"Outstanding food, consistent and unpredictable. Great atmosphere...",5
Steaks were delicious (although the special bone-in filet didn't relly seem Finstone sized to me. Try the portabella fries. Very good. The waiter suggested a wine that was better (and cheaper) than what were going to oder. Expensive though.,5
Went for Restaurant Week and were made to feel like we were annoying for ordering from the Restaurant Week menu. Food was good but it's been better other non-RW meals we've had there.,5
My husband and I have have been here at least 7 times for dinner and have not been dissapointed ever... The food is amazing!,4
"My boyfriend and I have been to Quality Meats twice - once, for his birthday over a year ago and most recently during restaurant week. Both times, the service and food have been amazing. I was a bit concerned about going during restaurant week and ordering from that menu, but the server was extremely cordial, unlike a lot of other upscale restaurants during restaurant week who snub their noses. Fanstic experience guaranteed...we will definitely continue dining at Quality Meats!",4
"This place is THE best steakhouse that I have been too. Granted there are places I still need to go, this is the best food I've had in new york city. The Three Seared Fillets dish (1 with bernaise suace on top of fresh crab meat, 1 with peppercorn sauce, and 1 with a medallion mushroom sauce) is the best food-for-the-cost dish I've ever had in my life. As a person who has eaten around the world (Anthony Bourdain-esk considering I've travelled to 7 countries), this dish is now my favorite. It should've cost $80 dollars but was only HALF that price.",4
This place is a must visit if you love red meat. It's pricey but more than worth the money.,3
"I loved the decor of this place.  The hanging meats display makes this a very unique place to dine at.  They are not kidding about the quality of their meat, some of the best meat I've had. I highly recommend this place",3
"Everything was very good. You will not be disappointed, unless you don't make resevations",4
The only downside of our meal was waiting over an hour for our reservation. The food was great (especially the marrow!) and the sommelier was very helpful!,4
"The food was good however I was disappointed with the steak options for the restaurant week menu. Then only offered skirt steak and hanger steak came with a $10 additional charge. Also the dessert options seemed very forced, all the offered was ice cream which was kind of pathetic. Although the staff was nice, we had to wait 40 mins to be seated after our reservation time.",3
"Food was great... but a little too hyped up. Food, Service, Ambiance- all great, but not so fantastic that I would go again, there are so many steakhouses in NYC to try!",3
"The food and service were very good, however it's extremely noisy and the tables are quite close together so be warned. We went for lunch & ordered off the restaurant week menu. We got the Brandt Beef Skirt Steak & the lobster which each had a $10 supplement, but they were worth it. The Double Fudge Mint Chip ice cream is yummy.",4
"The name may mislead you to think it is a butcher shop, and the meat cleavers in the window may frighten the timid away, but Quality Meats is a delicious adventure not to be missed. Under the same management as the famed steakhouse Smith & Wollensky, the modern twist to the traditional America fare at QM is delectably executed. The staff is friendly and professional. The wine cellar staircase, the chilled bottles partition, the nostalgic lighting all contribute to a intimate and romantic ambiance, enhancing the culinary experience.",4
The restaurant week menu skirt steak was tough though the sauce was good. The portions were small. The $46.00 rib eye was not so tasty though the made at the table sauce was good (though too tomato taste for one diner). It was very noisy. The service was good.,2
"food was amazing, service was a bit lacking. felt as soon as wait staff knew we decided to take advantage of Restaurant week prefixe menu, we were treated differently. not much attention, and waitress was not very engaging or warm.",4
Quality Meats has a great menu and great ambiance. The ribs with mint and basil were delicious. I would definitely recommend it.,5
We were rushed. The food came almost as soon as you ordered it. They cleared the plates before everyone was finished. Matter-of-fact we shared four desserts and they kept coming back to ask if we were done -- we weren't. It was annoying and they should stop that. Because of that I wouldn't recommend it.,5
Too noisy to hear the person next to you. Like eating in an emergency room on 9/11.,4
Fantastic food - great service - beautiful space.,4
But the noise level was off the charts; couldn't hear the,5
people across from me at our table.,3
"I went during restaurant week everything was fantastic. I figured that the portions would be small given that the food was so cheap, but we actually had too much food. I had skirt steak and since I always order my meat medium well, I was nervous that it would be dry, but it wasn't. It was so juicy that I barely needed the sauce I ordered to go along with it. I would reccommend this restaurant to anyone who enjoys a good steakhouse!!",5
"The scallops, steak and ice cream were delicious. Our server, Lou, was very attentive.",4
We always have a good experience here & don't understand why it is not rated higher by Zagat & other raters. Bravo QM !,2
"our waitress did not know the menu very well. we asked her for the menu items that did not include shellfish and she clearly made up the answer. other than that the food was great, but it would be helpful for the servers to know the menu so that guests can get the most out of the meal, no matter what the allergy.",5
"I must say I was extremely disappointed by their inconsistency of their plating. When there were multiple orders of the same dish, some guests in our party had a larger portion than others. Sad to say that, in my opinion, they may have lost their mojo. Lastly, their wait staff continues with their ""serious"" demeanor. This was more palatable then, but now that the food is sub-par, the wait staff can drop their less than friendly attitude.",5
"My wife and I ate an early pre-theater dinner at Marea the other evening and it was amazing.  From the friendly greeting to the professional service, Marea is a top New York choice for dining.  Our meal was delicious and we enjoyed everything that we ordered.  This is not an inexpensive restaurant and yet it was very much worth the money.  If one is looking for a very special place to dine for an anniversary or some other celebratory event, Marea should be at the top of the list.  Clearly this is one of NYC's finest restaurants.  I would highly recommend Marea and I cannot wait to return.",4
"There is nothing else like a meal at Marea, I adore this restaurant, always have.... I cannot recommend it enough!",5
"Very good restaurant, but certainly not among the best in NYC.",5
Outstanding experience. Food was exceptional and service amazing. Highly recommended.,5
The service was outstanding! The food was even more amazing!!,2
"Simply, a wonderful experience, for the environment, the food, and the service. We asked specifically for a banquette that a guest needed, which are numerous and comfortable. The interior is gorgeous in many ways. The service was attentive and unobtrusive. The food was excellent but the desserts were to die for! We ordered two (2) items - one of our guests abstained - and they gave us a third, all of which were extraordinary.",5
The restaurant was very crowded. Food was cold and  not appetizing  both at my table on the table next to me. The service staff did not care.   Table next to me complained to management without any caring response. ,5
I had an appetizer and entrée. I skipped dessert and left the restaurant as a result of poor quality on the first two courses. ,5
This restaurant is rated by Zagat as one of NYC's top 50. I disagree based on my experience.  The meal was too expensive to ignore the poor quality.,5
The best restaurant in New York City.,4
"Great food, ambience and excellent service! 👌🏼",2
"We enjoyed the experience. James was our server, very attentive. His suggestions were",5
very good. Miss the old semi freddo though with the chocolate!,2
"El restaurante  está muy bien ubicado, cerca de Central Park y Columbus Circus.",5
"La comida, así como el servicio, son de lo mejor. Tienen una selección de vinos bastante grande, y el ambiente se presta para cualquier ocasión casual o formal.",4
"Good atmosphere, excellent wait staff, excellent welcoming staff.  Food was good, and the raw oysters were superb, but on the whole we felt that our dinner was not outstanding.  The scallops were not cooked enough to suit our taste, and the clam linguini (which the menu  calls ""tagliolini,"" which means simply ""noodles"") was a bit short on the clams.   A satisfying experience, but not a spectacular one.",5
Waiter was not pleasant and short with us. The Halibut was over cooked on the top where it was seared. So hard it was difficult to cut. Underwhelming meal. Wasn't our first visit but with so many choices I see no reason to return.,5
"Fabulous anniversary dinner. The service and treatment was excellent, and the food from the amuse bouche to their artisan bread collection to dessert was fabulous. Especially notable was the lobster burrata appetizer, the octopus lobster app, and the housemade pastas. The coconut semifreddo was a fabulous dessert. Will definitely return.",5
"Sat for over 30 minutes before a waiter came to take our drink order. We almost got up and walked out, but we were there for my wife's birthday and just wanted to make the best of it without completely disrupting the evening. When our waiter finally arrived, he was not at all apologetic or very personable during the rest of our dinner. Not what I would expect for a place that is supposed to be one of the better restaurants in the city and overall very disappointing. The food was very good, but so what, it's NYC, you can get that and more for less than $200/person just about anywhere else.",1
"Fabulous attention to our anniversary celebration. Attentive, gracious, and generous service. The grilled octopus was especially delicious.",5
"Great environment, excellent food. Not sure if the appropriate place for kids.",5
The decor was very upscale and warm.  The service was attentive and helpful without being overbearing.  Food was excellent.  Would definitely recommend this restaurant.,5
Great meal!,5
"We recently had dinner at the world famous Paul Bocuse restaurant in Lyon, France. It was extremely good, however, La Grenouille was even better! In fact, our dinner at La grenouille was the best culinary experience we have ever had. It was simply fantastic in every dimension. La Grenouille, in our opinion, is the best restaurant in Manhattan, and possibly, the United States.",4
I heard it's amazing but it was really soso.. ,5
maybe it gets too crowded and the quality changed.,4
"A bit noisy, but charming, with wonderful steak, seafood, service. Only complaint was that the only choices for Restaurant Week desserts was ice cream -- would have liked more options.",4
"Otherwise, all was excellent.",4
"Having eaten at QM four or five times over the last year, it continues to deliver everytime. This time my friend and I split the porter house - cook exactly right.",4
"The corn creme brulee side is a must, consider ordering two - you wont regret it. (we almost order another one in place of dessert) The Bubble and Squeak is a more interesting carb side that you might normally pick with steak - but worth it.",3
The meatpacking location is better,3
"Great experience. Really made for a special bday treat. I will definitely return, and soon.",5
"Of course everyone has heard of STK. Usually when it's a popular place, there's a reason. I couldn't really pinpoint the reason when I went, other than the interior design. The bread that comes out in the beginning is actually probably the best part. The foie gras appetizer was slightly nauseating towards the end. The duck breast was a huge disappointment since I love duck. The side that came with the lamb was too nutty and just overpowered your mouth with flavor to the point where you couldn't enjoy the rest of your dish if you had another bite of the side. The truffle fries were good but did not live up to the hype. My friend had the summer ale beer and said it was nice, but all in all, more let downs than I'd expect from such a place.",3
Excellent food and service. My husband and I will return on our anniversary. We had skirt steak with broccolini as our entree.,5
"My husband and I celebrated my 40th birthday at STK. the staff was nice and our server was accommodation (I have a gluten allergy). The food was so good. Our steaks were cooked perfectly. At the end of our dinner, our server brought us over 3 ice cream comes and a candle and sang happy birthday. STK is a cool, hip looking restaurant. It was a great experience. I would recommend STK to anybody looking for a trendy restaurant with great food.",5
"Had lunch here for restaurant week. Wasn't impressed. The garlic soup appetizer tasted like salad dressing. All that dressing on my salad could have given me a heart attack. Fries were comparable to McDonald's. Steak was the only worthwhile part of the meal- delish! And the sorbet, well, we couldn't figure out what flavor it was and neither could our waitress. Overall, fair. Mediocre at best.",2
"I met a friend here for the 3 course $25 restaurant week lunch. I had the heirloom tomato salad which was fantastic, followed by the skirt steak cooked to perfection with a side order of french fries which were light and crunchy. The dessert was 3 small scoops of assorted sorbet, freshly made and creamy. The service was friendly and attentive. The noise level was a little loud, we did have to shout at eachother, we also had a bottle of sparkling water - which looked like it was made inhouse - a little steep, $12 and a small bottle of diet coke - $4 - the total bill with tip & tax was $80 - so just be mindlful of the add-ons, this place is pricey.",4
STK is in a perfect location for midtown client meetings.,2
"Unfortunately, I was there for a Friday lunch when the staff wasn't up to the challenge.",5
"Although the staff was quick to get our order and turn around a first course, over 35min lapsed from when we finished our first course to when our main course arrived. The waitress was not on top of the issue and the best she could offer was that a large party was creating issues in the kitchen. Additional delays occurred, and I was then made aware they ran out of desert. Overall, it was very unsatisfying and not reflective of the recommendations I had heard from others.",4
"I looked every NYC restaurant week establishment and their menu. After hours of research, I chose STK for lunch with my wife. It exceeded my expectations. Everything was excellent.",4
"The atmosphere of STK is great! Tons of people having a good time, nice colors and decor, the servers were great, the guys who cleared the table were attentive. The noise level once the DJ gets there is great for the bar, but not for the people paying for a nice meal. It was too loud to enjoy conversation and that is something I don't like.",4
Let's start with the positive...THE FOOD! Everything that was ordered was as described and delicious. Steaks were cooked as we liked and was tender and juicy.,5
"The negative (I wish I read reviews)...they had a live DJ in the main room. I love music, especially what he was playing, but I also wanted a quiet place to enjoy a steak.",3
All in all good place to get a steak with a group of friends.,5
"Enjoyed dinner, but somewhat pricey. Also, the music was great (lots of old school hits), but I was straining to hear my friends at dinner. Went home with a sore throat!",5
"No doubt that STK is top notch when it comes to the quality of the food. It is a bit pricey. Great for business lunches and dinners. They are very accommodating to larger parties. The bar scene is kind of crazy after work, with tons of suits.",4
"Went during Restaurant Week so I cannot speak for much of the menu as the Restaurant Week menu is limited. I can say it's a beautiful, well-appointed spot, what I did eat (Steak Frites) was delicious and the service was great. Looking forward to going again for dinner and experiencing the full menu. Definitely a cool spot.",5
"Love the ambiance at this place. I was there for the first time and had the lobster cobb salad. Big chunks of lobster and a few rolls of prosciutto were the main event in the salad, and were just delicious. I would definitely order that again! Everyone else at the table enjoyed (and finished) all their dishes as well.",5
I ordered the Tuna club which was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. The combination of the sushi grade tuna (seared perfectly and a nice thick piece) in conjunction with the egg and bacon was great. I would highly recommend STK for lunch.,4
"The food was superb, Quality is consistent , there steaks never let me down",4
Good food and service. A little on the loud side.,5
"Had dinner here with friends for my sister's birthday and everything was perfect from our server (Diana) to the food/drinks, and ambiance. She was so friendly and even brought us complementary champagne! The food was delicious! We each ordered entrees and each ordered a side for all to share. The corn pudding and Parmesan truffle fries are a must! Service was prompt and friendly. We never felt rushed. The restaurant was pretty full, but the bar was fairly quiet for a Saturday night. We were informed that the locals pack the place early in the week and head out of town on weekends. That may help you in deciding when to go there if you do/don't like the crowds.",5
"STK is an excellent choice, food is amazing, service is friendly and quick, plus a very nice environment the architecture of the place is beautiful, really a great restaurant...",4
"Service and food were excellent. Noise is a bit loud, especially with the DJ just around, difficult to speak, but this is the concept. More quiet for lunch. But always very good.",2
"A great lunch,friendly staff. To my surprise 50 Cents, the rapper walked in and I took a picture with him. So it shows that this is a great place for chic dinners.",4
"Came down with friends from Ottawa, Canada and everything from the moment we walked in was just a amazing experience, wine and drinks were great and the food was outbounds!!! Our waitress was very attentive and super nice.",4
"Known of course for its steak, STK did not disappoint in that respect. The side dishes however, left much to be desired. Great energy. I went on a Wednesday, and there was a party going on! Very unexpected. I enjoyed myself. The only other con was the wait. I had reservations (I arrived 15 min early) and was not seated until 30 minutes after my reservation time. Overall, a decent experience except the wait.",3
"I had an 8:00 reservation and called 4 hors ahead to let them know we would be there at 8:15 and to see if they would hold the table- they said they would. we arrived at exactly 8:15 and they said the table was not ready, we waited at the bar. we kept checking back and they kept saying that ther ewere no tables-- so what is the point of a reservation if there are no tables? they did not seat us until 9:15pm. and they told us it was our fault for being late-- i woudl have made a reservation elsewhere if they were not going to hold my table.",5
"We had a great meal and great service. The halibut was delicious. The bar scene was hoping. To keep in mind, the dining room was quit loud.",4
"Great power lunch place, suitable for clients. Good menu options. Nice wine list.",5
The music level made talking with those across the table impossible.,4
"I took a client out to this restaurant for lunch. It was perfect. Food was wonderful, vibe was good and my client loved her selection. Staff was very attentive and polite. Will definitely go back.",5
"Loved the interior, food and service very good. Wine list was very limited but otherwise everything was great",5
"We all loved it. We went on a Thursday night. Our table was ready promptly. The ood and service was great, although pricey for the size of the 38 dollar fish entree.the staff was so much fun and the dj kept the music going strong all night long. We will be back.",4
"The manager Rob was very helpful, walked by and took a picture for us. Joe was extremely friendly and looked as if he sincerely love his job and wanted everyone to have a great time. The waitresses for fun and friendly and smiled as they walked by you. One of them was dancing over the banquet and a great dancer. Overall I has a wonderful experience. The one thing that was difficult was that it was tough to speak with my friends during dinner because the music was too loud. I wonder if they could keep the music down until after typical dinner hours and perhaps raise it as it gets a bit later.",3
"Great food, awesome service, and amazing DJ. Makes for a great time.",5
Restaurant was very lively food and service was great.Manager came to table and was very friendly and gave us complimentary drinks.Very good experience would highly recommend,5
"I went to the one in Miami and loved it, so thought I'd try this one too. Our meal was very tasty. Service is always excellent. The bread wasn't as warm as it should have been, but was still delicious..",5
The location was beautiful however the menu does need some adjustment. Ordered the crust seared tuna and was not impressed.,5
"The strawberry cobbler martini is delicious, drink includes muddled strawberries which is a nice touch. The tuna tartar app with avocado is delicious, as is the filet medallion; which was cooked rare and just how I wanted it. Was very pleased with the service and amazing food. The server also told us about their new happy hour, which starts at 2pm and their amazing wine specials.",2
Great meats!,5
"Let me start off by saying that the food is phenomenal and the drinks as well. The ambiance is really second to none, although it is a pretty loud restaurant. Our waiter was phenomenal and we really liked him. Great service. Here's the negative: we were seated just before 11pm when I had a 9:30 reservation. The kitchen closes at 11:30, so what should've been a more leisurely meal felt a bit rushed. To make it up to us, they had a complimentary appetizer waiting for us at the table when we were finally seated. This was a nice, but the wait was still pretty absurd. Additionally, we had ordered 2 shots of of Don Julio 42 ($40/ea) to sip on while we waited for our table. After we were seated, by total and completely understandable accident, water was poured into the glass, so the waiter went to replace is quickly. However, what came back was not Don Julio 42 - the waiter even brought over the bottle to show that it poured from there, but the product inside was not what the label was. We still had one original glass of 42 to compare it to - and a side-by-side tasting proved it was not the same. It was undoubtedly a cheaper liquor. We just felt taken advantage of.",4
"Truly amazing food, the corn creme brulee is worth writing home about",5
Desappointing. Was better last time we went. More expensive and less taste and services,3
"Great service with two knowledgeable waiters working in sync catering to our every wish.  They were personable and made it easy for us. The place is beautiful, the decor is sharp, cool lighting, and we got tucked into a corner table allowing my parents to be able to hear and my daughter able to be herself.   Never have I had a bad experience here.",5
"Food was quite good but service hurried, impersonal, rushed. Our waiter seemed like his goal was minimal interaction. He seemed rushed and lacked any personality.",3
Very good place. Bartender neede a personality though.,4
Quality meats was the best meal ever had in my entire life. It was very expensive but well worth the money. My husband and I went for a special occasion And it was well worth it.,5
Outstanding as always! Food and service are always top notch! My favorite steakhouse!!,5
Great quality,5
I used to love this place. ,2
Have been here many times but have not been here in a few years.,3
They have cut many corners and the outcome is the food is meh.,3
Both steaks were over cooked. We were heading to a show so being short on time we ate anyway.,5
The hostesses who seat you were inattentive and the server did not communicate well. ,5
Bottom line is there are way too many other  better choices.,3
Service was really lacking tonight,5
"The primary reason was for what was supposed to be arguably the beat option with steaks aside  from Peter Luger.  We ordered the porterhouse for 2, bone in ribeye, 20 oz sirloin, filet. Lets start with the ribeye, sirloin and filet. It was well cooked with the specified cooking preference.  The porterhouse was ordered medium well and was closer to well done. I will get back to that. The appetizers were good not spectacular like the foie gras and clams. The clam chowder was too thick and cold. Lacks flavor. Did not complain about it just let it go. Corn creme brulee, asparagus and parmesan potatoes were very good. High light of food aside from the filet and ribeye. The wine list was extensive and we got a good cab merlot syrah blend. Now back to that porterhouse. It was cooked way past medium well and we did consume most of the edible parts as we were hungry and it was 10 pm.  We just informed the server about the faux pas and made it clear we just wanted to let the chef know that it was overdone and wanted nothing else. We were then approached by the manager Daniel. Right of the bat be was confrontational and indignant and insisted that it was how they prepare medium well and as the manager, insisted that we should have left the entire steak for him to examine. I explained to no avail that we did consume some of it as we were hungry and reiterated that we only wanted to inform them of the oversight. He continued to be on the offensive about our misstep. Until i had to stand my ground that he was being unprofessional and misguided about his train of thought. After I dismissed him to avoid further unwarranted discussions, we were unceremoniously informed by our server that they will comp our appetizers. I was just beside myself as we have reiterated that we did not want any concessions. We insisted on paying the entire $ 566.00 bill as we were not there for a free meal and also not to cheat the server of her rightful gratuity.",1
It was amazing.. from start to finish.. tables s little to close but it was ok,1
Superb steak and the side dishes were very good indeed.,4
The sirloin steak was bad. Had to return it twise....abd still it wasn't good enough. Everything else was very good including the Fillet cut.,3
"Excellent service, great steaks and sides. Noise level is above average, so not the most ""intimate"" of settings.",5
"I had planned the evening to celebrate a friend's milestone birthday.  Our reservation was acknowledged on arrival and we were told there was a slight delay and to wait by bar, 35 min later and after several inquiries we were shown to our table.  Got unfriendly and delayed service along the entire meal, and our orders would not arrive.  After more than an our and after having to call the manager twice to the table we got overcooked and sub-par meat.  It was a pitty that a celebration became a nightmare and the memory of my friend during his birthday is me frantically trying to get someone to get our food to the table. Needless to say we opted for coffee and desserts elsewhere.  Avoid this place like the plague.",4
40 minutes wait for table reservation and then 1 hr wait at table for entrees - very poor management and kitchen organization.  Waiter was great - but that was it - wouldn't recommend or return,3
Great steaks and service.  Lots of US wines.  My only criticism is they need more affordable good Spanish wines and a wider selection of Italian (Nebbiolo) wines.  It's a very Cabernet-heavy list.,4
"great food, loved a few creative things on the menu: the bacon and the corn souffle.  We ate on the second floor and it was exceptionally crowded and noisy, and a drunk table definitely had too good of a time - a few yells/hollers coming from their celebration.  Would not recommend if you wanted to have a conversation beyond chit-chat, but the food was delicious and the bar where we wanted was nice.",5
Phoenix our waiter was amazing and food/ambiance was exceptional,3
We Love Live QM. ,3
When we are in NY we dine there. ,5
Their bone in fillet is the absolute best and we have tried many. QM's,3
Fillet is full of flavor  and very tender. ,2
We also love their corn cream brûlée. ,3
Oh yes and their ice cream. ,5
The perfect meal every time.,5
It took almost an hour to get seated! This is an hour past the reservation time. So you wonder what is the purpose of the reservation!!!! It would be  much more honest to say ... come and we get you seated on first come first serve basis,4
love the interior decor and tasty food selections on the special occasional day/night,4
"Great ambiance, great food, great service, great wine list. This place is a must visit!!!",5
"Average at best. Steak was overlooked and didn't have much flavor. For as many steak houses as there are in the city, this did not stand out.",5
"$140 bottle of Cabernet was served  chilled, really cold. All wrong. Should never have  accepted it and am kicking myself for not heeding reviews where that was mentioned.",4
The service was one of the best we've has in New York. They were quick and attentive.,4
We had a party of ten and were seated promptly.The waiters were awesome. The food was good. The gelato was out of this world. Would definitely go back more oftem if it was in my budget.,5
We will definitely come back again,3
"Overall experience was fine .. not as great as it was about a year ago. Food was fine but again not as great as previous experience.  Asparagus tasted like charcoal, and the steak was not as tender as i expected or recalled.    The bacon appetizer was cold - tasty but cold and the Crab avocado app was again .. not as tasty as i recall.  They did not have a specialty cocktail that was absolutely delicious (pear sangria) and alternate suggestion  was not my cup of tea.  The service was fine - not overly friendly but plates were cleared in timely manner and food was brought out in timely manner. This was my second time there .. and do not believe it will be a go to a third time.",2
They must have been having an off night.  Usually much better than this time around.,5
Great foods and service as always. Best prepared steak on the city!,5
"The food was excellent! For me, it was a little pricey but great for a special occasion. We went early before the theater and had incredible service. The steak was delicious as were the quality potatoes & corn crime brulee 😋Our server was warm & helpful & even though I didn't mention our dinner was a celebration that night, I had put it in the reservation. It was remembered with a 'Congratulations' on the dessert plate! Above & beyond & everyone was professional and gracious. Great meal",3
Typical aircondition - very very cold inside!!!!!,2
"Service and food were very good- if you don't care about ambiance, or hearing your dinner companion, but you want to hear every word said by the people at the next table, this is a good choice.",5
We had an enjoyable evening.  On the expensive side but worth it. The staff were informative and accommodating,3
"They send you to the bar while waiting, common practice for all and I did not appreciate that. The ambiance is great, but service was below expectation. Food was average",5
Fantastic meal for our two year anniversary. ,4
We started with the thick cut bacon (of course!) which is creatively paired with peanut butter and jalapeños. Yum! ,5
"Complementing the bacon, we fired up a crab & avocado dish - light, but full of flavor. ",4
"Entrees were great per usual - 24 oz rib eye, 14 oz bone in filet with their signature side, the corn creme brûlée. ",3
"Our server had wonderful energy, expansive knowledge of both the menu and wine list, and the manager came by to wish us a happy anniversary. ",2
Will be back!,4
We had Lobster as a main course. It was delicious but the tools provided to extract meat from the claws were totally inadequate.,4
Great food and service. Wine costs can add up but worth it for special occasion.,4
This was truly a special dinner. ,5
The steak was out of this world. So flavorful you didn't need the house made steak sauce. ,3
Great service Great wine list. ,5
You won't be disappointed.,5
"i cannot say enough about Quality Italian, they nailed every point. It was a wonderful place for Brunch. They have a great menu and everything was perfect. I will definitely be back.",5
great food and atmosphere! would highly recommend it.,5
"Love this restaurant! So many good things to have! Chicken Parm- of course! Pasta with eggplant, ricotta appetizer, steaks, creamed kale, corn brûlée and all of the desserts!",5
"We had an early reservation and assumed we would be able to get lunch or dinner since it was a Saturday.  The menu was extremely limited and brunch was the only meal being served.  The food was excellent (some of the best shrimp cocktail!), just not exactly the options we were hoping for since we were considering this meal and 'early dinner.'",4
I will just jump in...,5
"We tried the chicken parm-pizza.  It was not as satisfying as a pizza because there was no crust.  Along the edges it was a bit fried, which was good; but that needed to be all the way to the middle of the pie for us to like it more.  However, if you missing eggplant parmigiana, like my girlfriend was, then this will not disappoint you.  It really tastes like it even though it's just chicken, cheese and sauce.",5
"We also tried their sambucca tea.  It was thick like honey, but also too sweet, like honey in coffee.",2
The ice cream is not to be missed.  The flavors are rich and delicious.,5
"We've been here several times, so we are working our way through the menu.  So far, my favorite was the corn gnudi; hers was the octopus appetizer.  ",4
"The restaurant is so well run and kept.  The service is efficient and attentive.  The piped in music has always been good, but our last night it was a totally inappropriate--death metal or something like it.  The crowd is largely old and money.  Metal is not appropriate for hearing aids and an expensive, elegant evening.",5
"Ps.  Don't get me wrong, there was also plenty of other demographics there; but the plurality is the older crowd.",5
"This was by far one of the best restaurants I have eaten at in NYC. Everything about it was just amazing. The bread, the wine and of course the food. You must order the corn brulee as a side, it's just outstanding! I am definitely coming back here for dinner as their menu is different.",4
Pretty impressed with how bad (slow) the service was and how bland the food was.,4
"Kate was a great server. The chicken parm is really for 3-4 people.  Lobster dish yummy, fish is really nice and simple. The spaghetti squash.... Off the chart! Salads are not necessary!The ricotta spread appetizer was really good,  So light and refreshing was the mixed fruit and champagne zabaglione sauce.  We had great martinis. This restaurant is upscale casual italian not gourmet foodie italian. Cool decor. Definitly a good choice for our group of 8; Our 23-26 year old kids/ friends and the ""tag along"" 50 something mom and dad had a great time at a nice round table!!",5
"I have been to Quality Italian several times.  The food and service never disappoint.  We had a delicious meal.  The only thing I could say that was missing was that the restaurant had no holiday decorations - it was not festive at all.  A little disappointing but the food, staff and service certainly made up for that.",5
Everything was incredible.  The Zeppole workshop was probably the best dessert idea I've ever seen.  This place (as well as Quality Meats) is in my top five NYC dining experiences.,5
"My inlaws were in town and we went here pre-theatre. Overall experience was excellent. Loved the Sommelier's Bin (got a lovely Barolo for only $75), the veal chop was great, was not part of the meal we didn't enjoy!",5
"The corn gnudi is excellent, though not inexpensive.",4
"This place feels less Italian and more like American contemporary with a few pasta dishes (note: I didn't know the official name of the restaurant was Quality Italian Steakhouse so I guess I should not have expected a true Italian restaurant). That said, the food is very good with a great wine list. My party started with the grilled octopus and eggplant polpette. Both were excellent, with the polpette being the larger of the two. We then ordered the branzino, the seared diver scallops, and corn gnudi. Of the three, get the corn gnudi. It's a really excellent gnocchi variant that is stuffed with ricotta cheese. ",5
"Service is really attentive and accommodating, spending the time to tell you what you are getting into. Staff is knowledgeable with the wine list as well. Ambiance is warm and open. Noise level is pretty reasonable for as large a space as it is.",5
 Creative apptoach to traditional favorites. Attentive staff. Fantastic meal but very loud. Not the place for close or private conversation.  Worth the price.,5
Brought five of my friends here to celebrate my birthday. From the first negroni to the last glass of Montenegro and everything in between was perfection. The service was fantastic. The octopus and steak tartare were my favorite appetizers. Dry-aged porterhouse angulotti and corn gnudi were the crowd pleasing pastas. My boy and I shared the 24oz tomahawk steak as an entre and it was to die for. Finished off the meal with my favorite Ferraro Roche gelato. Can't wait till next time.,4
"Service was great, warm and friendly. Our waiter sang Happy Birthday to my boyfriend and a diner next to our table with the same birthday. The food was very good. The spaghetti squash was excellent. ",4
We're definitely coming back.,3
"We enjoyed some of the menu standards and some daily specials and everything was delicious...especially their porterhouse agniolotti! Very nice wine list, great service...I love this place more every time I go.",2
I recently dined at Quality Italian with some friends and we had a delightful experience.  All five friends commented that it was an excellent choice and that they would return.,1
"This resturant was one of the most outstanding place to eat, with attentive service the food was ",3
"Wonderful. My friend and I went into the city for a play , we were going somewhere but heard about Quality Italian Steakhouse, as we were going to another steakhouse. We had the Porterhouse for Two. It was the most delicious steak I have had in along time. Our server Ernesto ",4
"Was very professional, the gentlemen that were sitting next to us spilled some wine on my friends coat, Ernesto saw it and went to get the hostess she came over and gave my friend a ticket to have her send the bill to Quality, we hadn't even said one word. I call that outstanding . A dessert of fresh berries and gelato also. What can I say I would definetly recommend Quality and will be coming back soon.",5
"We were all thrilled with the food.  Everything was beautifully presented and served.  We will definitely be back.  Order the chicken parmeggiano, excellent .",4
"At first, I thought I was off-put by the service in the opening introduction due to the curt, executive talking of the server, but I came to find that the server was very methodical, procedural, and ultimately that spelled good, timely, things for the rest of the evening.",4
"The service was prompt and attentive. The table bread was delicious. All the food was delicious. Also, the server was mindful of our interest in seeing a show on time, and I didn't need to say a thing about it--- he asked at the start.",5
"This restuarant is an interesting mix of classy and relaxing vibes. It's not stuffy, but yet has that ambience you want when you want to throw on a suit or take your lady out in her dress and eat well. ",5
"The tab can be a bit expensive (2 people = $150 including tip --- but remember this is an italian steakhouse,) It was certainly worth the price. As well, they encourage sharing and portion modification of virtually anything on the menu. ",5
"It was my girlfriend's birthday and they offered complimentary dessert; when we politely refused dessert as we were full, the server made sure to bring a complimentary glass of dessert wine which was a very nice gesture.",5
"I really appreciated the food, service, and ambience. I will be going back again.",3
"The sides were excellent, the lamb chops perfect, stuffed shell were excellent, the veal chop good, but I was hoping for better. All in all, very good.",5
Had a nice non-turkey hoilday at Quality Italian. They have a delicious meat ravioli with a light dough  and broth. Meat fussy husband was pleased with the filet mignon. Our second visit and we'll return again.,3
Good food if you stick to the basics. The hostesses are awful. The kind of service where they make it clear that the restaurant is far more important than you are.  Go instead to their sister restaurant Quality Meats where the food is better and the staff is not stuck up and far friendlier.,5
"Great food, great service but a bit too cold to be comfortable so bring a jumper!",2
The food took forever to come to the table and half was cold when it was delivered. The service was fair at best. The server seemed disinterested and short. Is the restaurant under new management? It seems to be going downhill quickly. Not a good experience the past two times. Bad experience at Quality Meats in Miami as well.,4
Great experience overall though the service was a little,5
Slow,5
"Good food.  The gentleman at the hostess stand was kind when we arrived and asked us to have a drink at the bar while they got the table ready for our 8:45 reservation.  He said they would come get us. He never returned to get us. Ended up eating at the bar and an hour plus later got a txt that table was ready. Too nice of a place for that kind of service from the ""face of the restaurant."" He had no real explanation when we left but did kind of offer a drink.  Despite that, the bartender was great.",5
I have been Miami and now New York. They offer a fair share of steak house favorites and more. solid food and good service...it is loud so intimate conversation would be tough.,5
"Birthday , amazingly perfect thank you",5
With reservation we wait a table 40 minutes! Excellent meats,5
"Excelent restaurant, with an excellent ambiance.    Good to share different plates and try.   Very good cocktails.   Good for any day of the week dinner.  Definitely a good choice",5
"This place is amazing! the food is insanely delicious and the service is outstanding. You can't go wrong here. Even if you just get a steak on a plate, and nothing else, you'll leave happy!",5
We loved the food but unfortunately had horrible service. The waiter didn't check on us once after we got out food and we had to ask another waiter to clear out table and for the check. It was another very disappointing trip to Quality Meats. He good is always great but they need to work on their service!,5
"La comida muy buena, pero el servicio bastante normal. Definitivamente tienen  que cambiar la actitud de las recepcionistas....",5
Great experience,5
Family celebration,3
"Whenever we visit New York, Quality Meats is an absolute must!! It never disappoints & we highly recommend the grilled bacon, peanut butter & jalapeño appetizer! The steaks are cooked to absolute perfection & if you order the corn creme Brule no need for dessert!!",5
"Great food. Service good. Great cocktails. Excellent meat, cooked to perfection.",4
One of our highlights during our trip to New York. Great steak. The sides are huge so beware! And good wine from the family vineyard.,1
"Sorry, but it is too loud.  Although I liked the restaurant, we could not return due to noise level.",5
Never disappointed with this place,5
"The service and atmosphere are second to none.  Our waiter was Chris.  Very professional.  Made us feel very comfortable.  I highly recommend visiting this restaurant for dinner if you are visiting new york.  The restaurant is mostly glass so you have a beautiful view of the city while you dine.  If you are  a wine lover, their wine list is massive.  Many great wines to choose from.  I eat at this restaurant every time I visit New York.",5
This place was awesome. Amazing food and great service. Loved our waiter and the dessert was delicious!,5
"The steak is by far the most bland thing in NYC. There are simply way too many good steak places in NY to waste your time here. Only reason I stopped by was because my favorite spots were all booked... Huge mistake. Do a quick search on steaks and go with the top three on the list. This place is just disappointing. On a positive note, lobster mash potatoes was good.",2
Dinner while panning our Thanksgiving Family gathering to watch Macy’s Parade at Del Frisco’s.   Got answers to our questions; each of us had a wonderful meal and we departed pleased and satisfied.  Thank you!,5
Exquisite as always. One of the best steaks across NYC. The lobster bisque is a number one recommendation. Just avoid to be seated all the way to the end of the left side on the lower floor as it feels very cramped.,5
Amazing meal and service!!  Can’t wait to go back for another special occasion dinner!!!,5
"This happens to be my favorite resturant  in NYC , I've been coming here for the past 20 +years. The food is superb,the service is spectacular and the bartenders make the best martini's.",5
Can't beat their  filet's.,4
"The bar service was great and our waiter was exceptional (knowledgeable, responsive, courteous). However, despite having a dinner reservation at 7:45pm we weren't seated until 8:45pm and the scene at the maitre' d's stand was both frustrating and stressful:  20+ people mobbing the stand and the restaurant staff being brusque and noncommunicative.",4
Birthday   Food came over cooked. All changes made and restaraunt chomped meal. Great business. Food was excellent second time,5
"Terrific experience; we had my parents' 50th anniversary here and they took excellent care of us. They even arranged for me to prepay the whole bill so we never had to get a check and we could pick up the whole tab on behalf of the party. Also were very accommodating with regard to an unusual food allergy and varied dietary needs (i.e. vegetarian, gluten free, etc.) Highly recommend, and worth the price (which is high, but it's worth it.)",5
"W went to Del Frisco's for our anniversary and thought it was fantastic. We will be back soon. The food was excellent and if possible the service was even better. We arrived at 6:55 for a 7:15 reservation checked in and sat at the bar for a drink. At precisely 7:15 our name was called and we were seated. When I made my reservation I put in a special request asking for a booth and was pleasantly surprised when we were accommodated. Additionally, when the waitress brought the wine list and menus she wished us a happy anniversary which was a nice touch. We shared the bacon appetizer (easily shareable) and a Cesar salad which were both delicious.   We both had steaks (NY dry aged strip and a filet) and shared creamed spinach and scalloped potatoes. Everything was delicious. Then the waitress brought us over a dessert with a happy anniversary sign on it and a candle. A great experience which I'm sure to enjoy again.",5
The restaurant was packed so we did not get our table right away. But the food was magnificent!,3
"Unfortunately I found this experience very underwhelming. The service was slow on the drink side. Never asked if we wanted a second. Although informative and helpful in choice making, waiter was rather robotic.",4
The meal was delivered much too close to the completion of the appetizer.,5
I felt the quality was not in the ballpark of a true steakhouse yet the prices were there.,5
I would not recommend this establishment.,5
Date night,3
"Never dissappoints. Great service, great food. I can not imagine ordering anything besides the bone-in Rib-Eye.",1
Awasome food!,3
"Amazing as always. Steaks were cooked to perfection at the requested temperature, sides are amazing and service is always impeccable. Since many years ago this is one of my fav steakhouses in NYC. Years go by and quality stays the same.",4
"Front desk exceptionally rude and dismissive, they were running approx 15 minutes late with bookings which is acceptable as it is very busy. When asking the front desk about our reservation(3 couples went before usall booked for 9pm),she was rude. After that, our name was eventually called, and a couple pretended to be us,tried to take our table! Again I had to mention to the lady that they've taken a bogus couple. ",5
"I felt the staff member didn't like the fact that I was asking why this was all happening . I hate to say it , but we were then given the worst possible table, stuck in the cold corner by the cashiers till and cloak room. ",5
Our waitress was lovely though and the ,2
Steak  was amazing! ,5
"I will not be going back. It's a shame as I'm a visitor from the UK , who was celebrating my daughters 21st",2
"Overrated and overpriced is the simplest way to express my feelings about this restaurant. We were made to wait for a full 2 two and a half hours for our meal. When we complained about the situation, the reaction of our waiter was nowhere near acceptable. We were offerred desserts as a compensation which helped to ease the pain somehow.  Thanks for the desserts but İ advice the management to reconsider their service standards!",5
"Way over-priced for the quality.   Have had better steak elsewhere, and this doesn't compare at all well to comparably priced restaurants.",5
It's a good place and Del Frisco's is no longer special among the many many steakhouse competitors in the city.  The seafood tower is a good choice if you have seafood lovers,4
"Del's is head and shoulders above any steak house in NYC or anywhere they are.  First, the signature VIP cocktail is so delicious it seems like you are drinking dessert!  The selection of appetizers ranges from salads to shellfish and everything is delicious. The crab cake is a must have. The selection and cuts of meat are extensive. The meat is always cooked perfectly to order and come out literally sizzling hot. The side dishes are amazing, the onion rings are crispy on the outside and soft inside. There is everything to love about Del Frisco's from the food to the ambience.",4
Our waiter was amazing! He even had a group of 11 right by us and we never felt like we were forgotten,5
"I've eaten here on several occassions and this has to be the worst experience yet.  Seating was jammed, waitstaff was overwhelmed, drink was knocked over with management apology, seafood tower came out with the salad (poor timing), 3 undercooked steaks.  The only bright spot was the lemon cake but even that couldn't overshadow the rest of the evening. I would have given a lower rating but folks reading this may think I was a competitive restaurant.  I would not recommend this spot if your trying to impress anyone.",3
The staff always takes amazing care of us and the food is always sublime! Best steakhouse in the country.,4
Food was excellent service not so good. After 45 minutes waiter was removing plates while we were still eating with fork in hand. He was very distracted or just wanted us out so he could fill his table again.,5
Birthday  dinner for cousin. Was great,5
"Great restaurant, super service, massive wine list and fabulous steaks. It is pricy as is to be expected based on its location in Manhattan.",1
"Was in NYC on business and my brother just happened to be in NYC for business at the same time. We met up for dinner and the ambiance was great! Just a lot of energy.  The food was good, not amazing but good.",5
Excellent food,2
"As usual, our lunch was fantastic.  Incredible food, excellent service.  My favorite restaurant in New York City.",2
"Without a doubt Quality Italian serves the best chicken parmigiana I've ever had and being from Australia, I've had a lot! It is 100% worth going purely for the parma! They're designed to be shared between two but we made sure everyone at the table had a bite so they could share in the deliciousness and within 5 minutes we'd already booked to come back so that those who hadn't ordered the parma could come and have one! ",5
"The service was fantastic and we really enjoyed our waiter, he loved the energy at our table and gave us a free cannoli when he brought out dessert! ",5
The ONLY downfall was that somewhere along the line one of our sides was missed and never arrived but with all that parma we were better off!! ,3
Dessert was also amazing! The fererro rocher ice cream was incredible and the waiter was fantastic at recommending dishes and drinks and was very honest which is always appreciated. ,5
10/10 would do again. (Already am!),5
Went for brunch...the Buckwheat Spaghetti ala Chitara is mindblowing!  The braised bacon melts in your mouth.  Don't make a mistake of taking it home and nuking them.  They disappear.  ,4
The staff from the hostesses to the waiters are very friendly!,3
"I had a reservation on a Friday at 9PM at Quality Italian.  When I arrived, it was pleasant to learn that my table was ready, and that we would be seated right away. However, they wanted to stick us (party of 2) in a depressing room in the way back (about a football field's distance from the hostess podium) right next to an alternate kitchen. I had been to the restaurant before numerous times and had good experiences, but for a Friday night and having secured a reservation, they could have been more accommodating. After I asked, politely, to be moved because of the ambiance and location of that highly uneventful and dull area, we waited for another 15 minutes only to be led to the first table in the dining room (where you can still have one foot touching the hostess podium), which had been vacant since I first arrived. I was extremely insulted, because I had seen other unoccupied open tables scattered around, but yet they chose to mock my request.  They give me the two extremities of the restaurant. They claimed that I did not want to be seated next to a server's station. If you have been to Quality Italian, they have many of these and that is pretty much unavoidable.  I don't mind that at all; I just didn't want to be placed in that bleak back room, which was for tourists who just want to eat and not care about ambiance, and next to a kitchen entrance.  The manager Dan came out and tried to make it right by seeing that I get ""table of my choice.""  He was nice, offered me free drinks (I refused), and acted much more professional than the hostess, who was not helpful and continued to argue semantics with me over my request.  After waiting another 15 minutes, we are finally seated at a nice table. The waiter ignored us for 1st 10 minutes or so; the only thing he accomplished was bringing out two glasses of tap water from the back, which in a fine restaurant, I have never seen this...ever. Water is always poured at the table.  HO- The food ended up being pretty good.",5
"Had some delicious cocktails (midtown & a vodka one), followed by oysters and I had the balsamic steak. It was delicious! My date had the veal dish which was gigantic! It was a nice atmosphere and our server was very helpful and attentive. I would definitely recommend for nice night out!",4
The short rib past dish was amazing.  The kale carbonara was a great way to deliver a hearty green.  We didn't have the chicken parm but it was amazing looking.  Looked like a pizza pie.,1
Brought friends this time and they all enjoyed the varied and different menu choices.  A good choice of wine and a please surrounds.,5
Service was great. We went on a Saturday at noon. Only a brunch menu was being served. It was very limited. I had a burger it was excellent. I wish I had more Italian choices.... That's why i went.  Their Monkey bread wasn't monkey bread at all. It was the same rolls they serve at Quality Meats. We were expecting sweet and gooey and got buttery and salty. I will return during regular hours with hopes of an Italian meal.,4
Great food. Great service. Lively evening.,3
"HAd an excellent fillet, and the eggplant pollente meatballs are superb.",4
"after asking for a server, we waited 45 minutes until we got our appetizer of 6 oysters (had to ask for that as well). we said since it is 2:15 was there any bread. She said it cost $4...obviously money wasn't the issue but given our experience it would be easy to offer (which she did at no cost), however it did not arrive. the female manager pretended not to see us and we provided feedback on our way out to Dan (assistant wine manger) who roamed the floor without talking to anybody. He was very apologetic and said ""we are better than that"" and ""write an email and come as our guess"". I wrote the email and never heard back. I have recommended this restaurant but will now rescind. It would be embarrassing for client/ friends to experience this level of service.",5
"great service, great presentation, great fun. the chicken parm pizza, veal shank and seafood tower are awesome. It was so fun!",2
"Sergai and Meghan and, our forget our other server's name (she recently got married, congrats again!) were all outstanding. The food was absolutely incredible. We will definitely be back. Thanks again guys.",5
"As with most steak restaurants, cocktails are great and the wine-by-the-glass list is extensive. We began with a shared octopus appetizer, tasty but cooler than room temperature and when asked if we liked it, we did mention the temp. We shared the chicken parmesan which is served in a unique style and was tasty but again not warm enough, but we did not mention this to the server who was attentive and cheerful but not obtrusive. The portion of chicken was too much for us; what a shame to leave it which we did. Much to our surprise and completely unnecessary was a complimentary dessert in response to our appetizer ""complaint."" We will certainly return.",4
"The restaurant had a nice vibe to it. It was packed wasll to wall. It was a noisey venue whcich I am not fond of. The food was good not excellent. The service was good and not excellent. I was with a eprson with food  intolerence and they were quite inflexible.  "" we are very busy"" is a line I hear often, but to me at a fine dining establishment that is to be expected and they should be able to accomodate to an extent wpecial needs. SHell fish tower was excellent.  Steak was good but not near the best I have had. the chicken parm was interesting and tasty. But it was ground up chicken not cutlets.. Some may perfer that but to me it reminded me more of a kids meal.. Overall, I would not tell folks to go or to stay away.  Too pricey for just a quick dinner and not good enough for a special occasion.",5
"It was our first time and we loved it , the service was great and the food was amazing ! Location is good too ! ",5
"We had steak as a main and we enjoyed it a lot , as for appetizer we had tomato with creamy cheese it was th best we have ever had . We will definitely come back here",5
The absolute best service ever! Delicious food and sexy ambiance,4
"The dishes were unusual, delicious and the service was excellent.",5
"Best baked clams ever, ricotta honey and pine nuts on the perfect garlic ""toast"" a must, Italian salad was delicate with surprise ingredients, roasted Brussels sprouts were a touch salty but addictive.",5
The caramel crisp and pecan coffee ice cream was not very exciting. ,4
A perfect place for a celebratory meal. Too high priced for a standard dinner out.,5
"We were extremely pleased with the food choices, the preparation, the quality and taste, everything superb. Our waitress did everything to make us feel comfortable and happy, and she made great recommendations on the wine. My friend had just flown in from LA, she was very impressed.",3
"We had an amazing meal at Quality Italian, food drinks and dessert were all outstanding and our server Roberto was excellent as well. We had a great time.",3
Good Food. Nice atmosphere. Steak was above average.,4
Food was excellent and service was quite good even though every table was full.,5
"The gnocchi I ordered was good, but the portions are too small for the price you pay.",4
Portions are tiny. Lobster roll was small and tasteless despite being fra diavolo. Service was good. Not worth the price and I wasn't paying.,5
"Came for a business lunch.  Our server was terrible (indifferent, not attentive), but the veal was top-notch as was the lemon merengue tart.",5
Expensive but 10000% worth it. Chicken parm is the best I've ever had!,5
"We picked Quality Italian from instagram postings, the bar upstairs had great cocktails and the bartender was very nice. We had a party of 6 for a birthday, the corn side dish was amazing, filet was cooked perfect, the 1/2 chicken was a bit dry. The signature Chicken Parm wasn't hot and pricey since its sold pp. ",5
"Overall it was nice but wouldn't hurry back, more to try !",5
This was my first time dining there for dinner. I had the lobster pasta and it was outstanding! They flambee the dish in front of the guests which adds a cool touch to the overall dining experience. I truly enjoyed the dinner.,5
"Group of 4 went to Quality Italian for a pre-theater dinner and it was amazing! The service was incredible (at one point our waiter literally said, ""whatever you want--we will do WHATEVER YOU WANT"" and he meant it), the food was delicious and the overall night was great! We had so much fun we almost were late to our show because we completely lost track of time!",3
Food was very good & service exceptional; enjoyed lunch with a friend & it was great; have been to Quality Meats as well....both always spot on!,3
Great place to catch up with an old friend. Great meal,5
"Whether at the upstairs bar /main dining room, food and service at Quality Italian are second to none. Seriously good service and seriously good food! Unfortunately the main dining area is extremely loud (beyond OTs ""Energetic"" rating scale). You will have to raise your voice to talk to the person seated right beside you; forget about across the table. Oddly, management also leaves the music playing, although all you can hear is the constant bass beat of some unrecognizable song. We're ""fun"" poeple, we love energy and engagement but this is so bad it will make us think twice about returning.Apparently noise is an intended part of the QI experience.",3
I saw 2 of the Chef's at a cooking class. I am glad i went. Look forward to going back with friends and family!,4
Food was as good as it gets with very attentive staff,5
Wine list was overpriced and lacking in a decent wine under 100 dollars,5
"Noise level was too high for the price of the meal, I dont want shout when Im paying 350 plus for dinner",5
"Food was only so-so. Chicken parm is popular but weird. Like a big ground chicken hamburger with pizza topping and crust. pasta special tasted like velvet a cheese. if you go, stick to the steak.",5
I brought my partner here for our anniversary.  As a trained Italian Chef i can honestly say Quality Italian is a personal favorite.,5
I'm not sure how this restaurant gets any good reviews related to the food.  They use a lot of seasonings and overly salt the food.,5
"Also,  the food is described in one way and is plated another, for example eggplant meatballs with burrata cheese is actually fried eggplant balls with melted cheese over it in a tomato sauce.   The fries were so overseasoned. Unfortunately, the food did not agree with my husband and he had a stomachache from eating at quality Italian and he only ordered veal Marsala.  Which looked nothing like veal Marsala by the way.",5
I honestly think that this is a restaurant that I will never return to and if your considering it...skip it.  It's expensive for the quality and there are so many better restaurants in Manhattan that you can spend your hard earned money at.,5
Great dining place. A new fav when I come to NY! My 10 yr old tried the grilled octopus and loved it. The sides were all delicious too -- we had Parmesan potatoes and very good.,5
"Really good spot. The chicken parm pizza is amazing, though very filling (obviously). Really good cocktails and appetizers, and a great wine list. Food is overpriced, but not super crazy for Midtown. All in all a good dining experience.",4
Great food and service. Would recommend to my Dad.,4
Truly an amazing dining experience !!,5
"Great food, service and the most pleasant hostess !",3
One of my favorite spots when I visit NY. Great for brunch or dinner - and in a great location - I always recommend Quality Italian to visitors and New Yorkers alike.,4
Awesome chicken parm pizza.   Never had anything like it,3
"excellent food and good service, definetly recommend this restaurant",2
"I am not a big fan of restaurants that insist on credit cards to hold reservations, and even less of a fan of measured drinks at the bar. That being said- we arrived early, had drinks at the bar and were seated right on time. We didn't like our table and were quickly and happily moved.",5
"Garlic Bread brought to the table was delicious and we started with the Chicken Parm Pizza and Sausage Toast as appetizers; not only were both tasty, but it would have been enough for a meal (and we were 4 ). Our waiter explained the dinner menu and we ordered filet mignon, veal chop, pork chop and cavatelli, as well as truffle fries and spinach as sides. It was way too much food. Every thing was great, except for the pork chop, which was a little overcooked and dry, but was better as you got closer to the bone. We were told it was prepared to medium well and it was. The issue was addressed and we were asked if it could be taken back, but it really was OK",3
No room for dessert but we were brought ice cream to make up for the pork chop issue. Nice touch of hospitality.,5
"The check came and we found we were charged for a bottle rather than a glass of Pinot Noir. It was taken off the check , but kind of makes one wonder....We never really go over our checks that carefully, but will certainly start to- It was a $44 error.",3
I wish the location was somewhere else in the city- not really a fan on dining in Midtown. A bit to corporate during the week and touristy on weekends.,5
The food was out of this world. I wish I could have gotten more entrées. The ambiance is modern and warm.,5
Server was too over powering. Would not leave us alone until we ordered something. Chicken parm tasted awful; served round like pizza and cut into 8 slices.,5
Would not go back if someone else paid.,2
"Excellent service on every visit, coupled with gourmet Italian food.  Small touches take this restaurant to another level, the bread is a highlight - baked in-house and still warm when served. Take a seat near the windows for an exciting view in a fabulous area!  Staff is detail oriented and they don't miss a beat.",4
Brunch was fantastic! Loved the bananas foster french toast. It is to die for.  Our server was very accommodating. It was a very relaxing experience.  Will definitely be back.  Next time we would love to have dinner. Highly recommend!,4
Just get the chicken parmigiana pizza... That's all I need to say.,3
"Service was prompt at First when there were few tables.  Once it picked up forget it . Portions small uneventful ....much better at their other establishment.   With so many choices for Italian in the city, I won't return.",4
"great homemade pasta dishes, the veal with pappardelle is outstanding and obviously their chicken parm",5
"The restaurant is very much in line with chain steak houses. Even though the name is Quality Italian, the menu is basically a steak house menu with some Italian influences. The food is very good but not noteworthy. The menu is small & the prices are large. The large dining room is loud & the service is a little weak. They do have a large wine list, deep in vintages with a couple of special bottles at better pricing than the rest of the list.",5
"I went with 6 people for an intimate bday dinner for my husband. All the food was phenomenal, everyone really enjoyed it.",4
energetic atmosphere and excellent food. Not inexpensive. service was as good as one might expect.,5
The chicken parm is a must.  And it may sound weird but definitely dip it in the honey.,4
"The waiter took much too long to see us and even after we spent a considerable amount on wine, the service was still very poor, everything took way too long.  The least he could have done was apologize or send over a dessert to apologize. Sometimes that all it takes, but he did not do that.  And the gentleman that wrapped up over ""to-go"" literally dropped the bad on the floor.  Nice was to treat your food, I'm sure the chef would have loved that.  Very disappointing.",5
Took my wife there for her birthday dinner with the family. The service was excellent and the food was very good. We had the chicken parm pizza and the pork chop with cherries and crispy sage. Food service was prompt with many people to attend to the tables. We were going to a show at Jazz at Lincoln Center - it was just a short walk after a fine dinner. Would highly recommend.,5
"We of course tried the chicken parmesan which was delicious but extremely filling - but the good news is that we have leftovers for a week.  The honey was a nice, subtle touch.  Since we only went as a table for 2, we only had enough room for the chicken parm and 2 appetizers - the beefsteak tomato straciatella (very good - the pistachio added really nice flavor) and the carne cruda (not bad, but not my favorite).  The bread was delightful but as everyone warns, don't fill up on it too much since you want to save room for everything else.  Service was the only area of improvement as we did have to wait quite a while and the staff neglected a birthday request despite my note in my OpenTable reservation as well as a conversation with the reservationist.",5
We'd love to go back one day to actually try the steak and pork chop.,5
"The food was OK but not memorable, and given the cost, memorable was anticipated. Three requested menu items were not available, and our waiter did not advise us until after we asked for the item.",4
"This was a great meal.  Everything was cooked perfectly. The pasta dishes were absolutely wonderful. One of the guests at the table had the branzino and it was fantastic.  Tried a few of the crudo's and,while the portions were quite small, they were wonderful. Service is on point. Loved this place.",5
Wonderful food.,4
Chicken farm did not live up to the Hype.. Overpriced and not fair thats its per person.. and it s the same size no matter how many people! it was salty and too thick!,1
"From the moment we arrived, I felt like this was the perfect place to spend the evening. The servers did everything to cater to our expectations and desires...the bread was incredible and meal was exceptional. The spicy lobster rigatoni was expertly prepared table side.  I was even able to find a wine in my price range with a little help from the waiter...a great evening enjoyed by all!",5
Fantastic- grilled Branzino and wine was just a perfect pairing before our concert at Carnegie Hall,5
Always reliably good food. Atmosphere and service are the best.,5
Food was amazing  great vibe the corn  crème brûlée  Is amazing,5
"The chicken parm never fails to disappoint. Fun, energetic environment delivering great food as well.",4
Incredibly perfect. Made us feel special.,5
"Had great lunch there on last trip (food and service), so decided to try dinner.  Wait staff appeared to be stretched thin and our drinks were empty several times -- and we realize staff was busy with large groups.  Food was great -- but service was not -- especially for the cost versus other options available in NYC.",3
Great steak!!,5
"We took our son on a visit to NYC. He and I ordered martinis on the rocks, but they came straight up. When we gently reminded the server we ordered them on the rocks, he said he would take them back and ""put them on the rocks"". That s exactly what was done. Needless t say they were watery and diluted. Shame on you, Quality Italian! Although the lobster pasta and eggplant balls were delicious, this is what I will remember most from my visit.",4
Good Food. Nice atmosphere. Steak was above average.,4
"Can only give a restaurant a second chance once. This was if.  Waitress with attitude, lack of attentive service. Waited 15 min to have a condiment delivered to table for appetizer and had steak delivered before app was finished! Tomahawk steak not cooked to order and sat at table til app was eaten.",2
The chicken parm served like a pizza was outstanding.  That alone was worth eating at this restaurant.,5
"Chicken Parm was a let down. It's inventive that it looks like a pizza, but the taste was fair at best. The chicken seemed like a low grade smooshed up burger in appearance. It kind of looked like a proccesed dark meat chicken patty.",2
Desert was excellent.,5
Great spot for a dinner with that special someone. Specialty cocktails were strong and delicious. Steak for two was cooked perfectly. Would recommend to anyone.,5
Perfectly executed meats and classy waiters!!! A must for a night out.,3
"I'll get the obvious ones out the way - the food and the service were really good.  I was a big fan of the grilled octopus, and her filet was delicious as well.  We got the tartufo for dessert, also delicious, but don't believe them when they say it's for 2 - unless that's the only thing you get I wouldn't recommend it for less than 4 people.  ",3
"However, the menu and the prices (especially for the wine and cocktails) will make you feel like you are in a steakhouse.  If you are looking for old school Italian, this might not be the place to go.",5
"This was the noisiest restaurant that I have experienced. Although we made our reservation several months before, they stuck us up against the windows.",5
"Only issue I had was that I called the restaurant to let them know we'd be a few minutes late for our 8:30 reservation. The hostess told me that she would note that on the reservation, but when we arrived at 8:35, the reservation had been moved to 9:00, and we were forced to spend approximately 25 minutes in the bar.",5
Date night for Valentine's Day; two 10 oz steaks that were delicious paired with wine. Downside it is a bit pricey.,5
a most delightful restaurant. Good for business functions (Denise Bryant is awesome to work with for special group functions).,5
Best Chicken Parm arguably in the New York City. Definitely need to try it,4
Our busser I think her name was Leslie. Was amazing. Made the experience so much fun,5
Outstanding experience....food was outrageous and the ambiance perfect for a date,3
"It was great, aesthetic and tasty.",5
Good food. Rude waiter who continually tried to upsell everything.,4
Fabulous corn brule!  The bread was amazing and our meal was delicious.  Will come back!,4
I gave my usual high rating of this restaurant. It is an amazing experience. I have dined at this location and its sister restaurant Quality over a dozen times. Always consistent and everyone is amazing,5
Food was excellent as always. Service was not up to usual great standards.  took quite awhile to get waiter's attention.  Water not refilled etc.  Not sure what the issue was but hope this is not a recurring theme because QI is one of our favorite restaurants.,5
"Quality Italian sounds like a cheap Italian join in a seedy part of the time attempting to dupe weary meal seekers with the endorsement of ""Quality"" before Italian. But no sir, Quality Italian might be one of the greatest meals possible. If I had a trust fund and no student debt, I would eat here daily.",5
"Our favorite go-to restaurant when we are in town. Easy to get to, great food, great service!",5
"We make a point of eating here every time we visit NYC and it never fails to deliver an amazing meal -- the house-made ricotta appetizer was to die for, and the wine selection is phenomenal. The bone-in tomahawk rib eye is one of the best steaks I have had in the last decade -- they were hitting home runs from start to finish with every single course that hit our table!",4
Fantastic meal. I never miss going to Quality Italian whenever I'm in NY. Don't miss the chicken parm!,4
always a very solid meal,5
have never had a bad meal and have been here at least 10 times,5
Great service and terrific food.  Chicken Parm could only be ordered for 2.  Wish they had it as individual,5
We had a party of 8 and had a highly enjoyable evening.,5
We stopped in for lunch following the Radio City Show on the day after Thanksgiving. Great service and food. Would go back anytime.,4
"Although the cc machine was out of order and we needed to pay cash, the told us asp....lovely place great service yummy food.",5
"The pasta was slightly under cooked, but the sauce was good. The pizza was also OK. I didn't get much of an italian vibe in the restaurant with all the french posters on the walls, but I still liked the ambiance. Pros, the localisation if you are going to a Broadway show is undeniably very convenient and the service was good and efficient. Overall, I won't go again because I'm sure I can find better Italian food in NYC.",3
"What a pleasant surprise! We were a party of 10 and the way the manager treated the staff and the service treated the customers was excellent! We were a group of 10 Italians from Jersey with children and we can't wait to go back! The sauce had amazing flavor, the raviolis were like clouds of goodness! The only negative was do not order the appetizer Clams Oreganata. Unfortunately the breading was not done right and the server was kind enough to offer to have it removed from the bill after he noticed I didn't eat it the appetizer. I have already recommended this restaurant.",5
I took 10 employees to lunch after i treated them to the Radio City Christmas Spectacular. The restaurant is very close to Radio CIty. Staff was very attentive. Will definately go back.,5
Interesting large space (needs paint color upgrade). Heaping dishes of predictable pasta and other entrées suitable for the whole family. The service was prompt and friendly.,3
Food was very good. Service was a bit unorganized as they brought my wife's dish at least 10 minutes before bringing mine and before we were done with appetizers. Overall the experience was good and I would return to try other menu items. I would also like to know how to order some of the great looking and smelling breads visible as you come into the place. I could not find them on the menu provided in the restaurant.,3
Looking for a restaurant in the theatre district this is a great one. Great location for Radio City Music Hall or top of the theatre district. Fast and friendly service. Can accommodate medium sized groups. Reasonably priced. Food was excellent. Would highly reccommend it to anyone.,5
"I was looking for an Italian restaurant with a diverse menu that was kid friendly. This was it. The menu had a wide variety - salads, pasta, pizza and entrees. The food was closer to a 3.5, but I really enjoyed their caprese salad and the chicken francese was tasty. The bread was great. It's an open restaurant. While there weren't a lot of kids, the place was loud enough that no one minded our group and the waiters were very attentive. They didn't cater to kids, per se, but were accommodative and friendly. It was a tad touristy, but it was just what we needed and the entire staff was warm and friendly. I would go back.",3
"There were 9 of us. Ranging in age 18 to 50+. The dinning room was spacious and as a big group we were tucked away so we did not seem to be disturbing the other guests. Everyone found something without any fuss. The host, the servers and the bus boys could not have been more friendly.",5
We reserved on line and we received several friendly reminders before our trip.,5
The selections were plentiful and varied. Everyone had a different dish. All were more than generous portions and there were zero complaints. Oh...did I mention we were an all girl group and some of us can be very fussy.,3
The prices too ranged from reasonable too erase for New York City.,4
"We do not get to the city often but when we do, we will return!",3
We were looking for a family friendly Italian restaurant near Times Square that could accommodate our group of 16 on the night before the NYC marathon (a tall order). This restaurant hit the spot. We were seated comfortably and treated wonderfully by the staff. The staff was willing to bend over backwards to accommodate the special needs of my daughter who has numerous food allergies. The food was delicious.,3
"It was fine for a quick bite before the theater. Nothing special, but solid in its quality of food and prices. The waiters seemed to have trouble understanding us when we made requests. Since they were heavily accented, I can only imagine that it may have been a language barrier. I had noted on my Open Table reservation that this was a birthday dinner, but no one seemed to notice. In fact, we were not even asked if we had a reservation when we arrived. I would go back for a casual dinner. Extremely close to tho the Eugene O'Neill Theater. Very convenient.",3
First time at this restaurant. Look forward to returning when in the area for a show or just passing thru!,5
"Friendly staff (especially our waiter). Good food and portion size. Nothing fancy. Casual and not expensive (which is hard to find in Manhattan). We were going to a show at Radio City Music Hall and the waiter made sure we would be out on time! We all ordered a different pasta dish -all great. Menu also included choices in meat, fish and of course pizza! Appetizers good also.",5
We brought a relative visiting from Italy and she totally enjoyed everything!,3
"Fried calamari was very good, lite batter, non greasy nor chewy, great sauce for dipping. Linguini with white clam sauce had only 4 small whole clams and lots of chopped clams, whole dish tasteless except for the garlic.",4
"My friend and I needed a convenient place to eat before the theater and wanted pasta, so this restaurant was a natural choice. Although we were seated in a corner where the noise level was lower than elsewhere, it was still noisy, mostly because of one table. The food was OK but not special, and the service was satisfactory--slow at first but later more attentive. The decor was pleasant, with lighting subdued just enough so that we could easily read the menu.",4
Fresh pasta with good vegetarian options. Solid place.,4
Their whole pasta options are perfect for the heart healthy conscious,3
"Went after a Broadway show. Was seated immediately, not very busy. Not sure why! It was great service, very friendly. Food was very good. Enjoyed dinner greatly. Great value for the area. Wish we had discovered this place years ago.",4
"We were planning a nice meal to celebrate a special occasion, and this restaurant was recommended to my daughter by a friend from NYC. It was just ""ok."" Not what I was hoping for. Standard Italian fare in a clean, but not a special restaurant.",3
LARRY THE GM HAS YRs EXPERIENCE FROM THE BOTTOM UP AND IT SHOWS. GREAT PLACE FOR BUSINESS OR A DATE. WINE LIST IS VERY REASONABLE...,5
My favorite restaurant forlumch meetings. Wine week is an absolute must.,5
I enjoyed a delicious lunch with friends at Quality Meats. The service was great - very knowledgeable and friendly. Porterhouse Steak was fabulous!,5
"The service is not bad, but not great either, given the price range of the restaurant; it's more like, indifferent.",3
"The food was very good at Quality Meats. The lamp chop special was excellent, and the steaks were flavorful. The wine list was impressive. The service was fine, I wouldn't say superb - but fine.",4
Very good food and excellent service. The lunch menu is a relative bargain. I will definitely go back.,4
Absolutely great place to dine if you've got the spare cash!,5
great food! awesome service. excellent ambience. only drawback is noise level...,5
"This is the fourth time I visited and I was truly disappointed. All other times it has been great. This time food was not cooked correctly, service was spotty, food came out at different time. Just overall not good.",3
"We were seated next to the a very loud, drunken birthday party even though our reservation was at 10:30 pm and there was plenty of other tables available. Service was not smooth as we had a waiter transition so our order wasn't taken for awhile and the homemade sodas were no longer available since the maker had gone home for the evening. To make things worse, our rack of lamb was totally overcooked as was both orders of corn creme brulee. The staff started moving tables and shutting down for the night before we were even done with our meals. An unfortunate experience.",2
Fantastic! Great food and atmosphere.,5
"Certainly nicer looking and more contemporary than the average steak house, good music and lighting and friendly service too, which is a plus, but we expected tastier steak (we had filets, not the best barometer - one of the four was not cooked as ordered) - they were fine but nothing special.",3
"Considering how remarkably snobby I am when it comes to food, believe me when I say this will easily be one of the best (if not THE best meal) you will ever have in your entire life. From the table-side-made steak sauce to the PHENOMENAL chocolate rum raisin ice cream, no detail is overlooked. And if you are a true foodie, the roasted bone marrow and diver scallops are two ABSOLUTE musts. Also, check out the rib steak if you can. Delicious rich and flavorful and comes with a foot long rib bone attached use as a handle lol. Hands DowN the best meal of my life.",5
A very enjoyable evening. We had mentioned that it was my dads 60th birthday and upon arrival our party of 9 were seated at a round table ( always nice for a group so you can see and talk to everyone). We were all served a complimentary glass of prosecco and made to feel relaxed and welcome. Our waiter couldn't gave been more helpful without being intrusive and the food was faultless. All in all a great experience,5
"A good spot for business lunches, though it is a bit on the loud side. dishes are generously proportioned. A great overall experience.",4
The steak tartar is outstanding!!!,4
"Great New York City Steakhouse!The rib Steak is outstanding and with the Cowboy Cut the presentation is very impressive(the double rib steak being shock and awe!) Service is very proffeional and friendlier than some of the Old School joints.I've enjoyed a meal here with a friend and several with groups of people and they have been great for both.Great place,great time!",5
"Best meal of our trip.....always visit when we're in town, and have NEVER been disappointed. Thanks for making our trip and outstanding eating adventure.",5
Exceptional Lunch. The food was great and the Home-Made Ice Cream was a dream. I'll be back.,4
Delicious! Best aged and prepared meat 2 Texans have found in NY.,5
We had a group that included adults and teenagers. Everyone had a great time and enjoyed the food. The service was excellent,4
My wife and I had a excellent lunch.  The steaks were cooked perfectly.  Will go back again.,4
"Good steakhouse, but somewhat disappointing this visit. 24 oz. bone-in rib-eye appeared to be at least 16 oz of bone, if the total weight were correct. Similarly the lobster seemed a lot smaller than billed. Service was OK, not great. Seems like a hot spot, but the experience was not as good as in prior visits.",3
"This is a nice restaurant. The food was very good and the service was excellent. As a couple, I didn't think that we got the attention that groups did and we were ""parked"" in a corner away from the main scene.",3
"Good food, but nothing special. A dinner for 2 people each with 2 drinks cost almost $300. That was too much! The cuts of meat were large and done well enough - but everything else was a bit pedestrian. Bland ceasar salad - strange but tasty bread rolls and then the side dishes were just OK. My husband and I both decided that we won't need to go there again.",3
Couldnt be better - pricy but well worth the money - service was excellent especially when my wife accidentally dropped her water glass. The meat (steak and ribs) was to die for - just cant get that quality over here in England,5
"As always, Quality Meats was a crowd pleaser for our group. Steaks were perfect. Even though everyone was full, the incredible homemade ice creams were a nice finish.",5
"the crab cake was amazing, the tri-filet was a good try, but overcooked.",4
"Second time I've been here and again, I left feeling great. Food was awesome and the service was attentative. This is my favorite steakhouse.",5
It was great! It was recommended by a friend. It was my first time and sure not the last one. I loved everything about it. I will recommend it to anyone. Thank you for a great evening,5
music was too loud....especially if your having a business lunch!,4
Great meal overall. Steak was excellent. Sides were good for the most part- loved the creamed corn brulee especially. Dessert was fantastic (had the ice cream). Service was good. Liked that they had wines in every price range. Bar was a bit pricey...,4
"OMG. LOVE LOVE LOVE is only way I could describe this place. I LOVE Peter Luger but this place gave me the same feeling I had when I went to Peter Luger for the first time. I can't wait to to back. Service was out of this world. If you love meat, this is the place. This place puts other steak restaurant to shame.",5
I am in a rut. Every time I go I have the openfaced filet and corn creme brulee. My only variety is the appetiser. My favorite is the best crab cake in the world.,3
"Great atmosphere and decor, the food was top notch and high quality. A great place for a business lunch.",5
Food and service was fantastic!,5
this was the second time I ate at Quality Meats and the food was delicious. Service was only okay. I had to ask for my wine glass to be refilled twice. I will definitely go back.,4
"This restaurant is just excellent! Great food, great service, great atmosphere and very affortable! Deffinitelly reccomended!",5
"We have enjoyed Quality Meats before, but this time the food and service was very disappointing, notwithstanding that manager was very polite and quick to address the situation. We will return one more time to see if this was just a night that the 5 star food and service was an isolated miss. If you go, do try the most incredible diver scallops, which despite the disappointing food otherwise, alone scored 5+ in our books.",2
"Better even than anticipated (given great reviews). Phenomenal meat and sides and oh-so-attentive staff, very helpful with suggestions. This was a birthday dinner for a family member, and it was a grand experience....you get what you pay for in this instance!",5
Fantastic service and the food was great.,5
Another beautiful lunch. Thank you!,5
The salt crusted Branzino is amazing.,5
Their Pasta is as good as it gets.,5
A must in NYC,5
Tried the fusilli per everyone’s recommendation and it did not disappoint! Delicious and unlike anything I have eaten before.,5
Great,5
Wonderful Service,5
Go to for seafood Italian style,5
Absolutely one of my favorite places to dine.  Love the quality of the food and the people.,5
"We loved the Restaurant, the food was absolutely amazing. We were celebrating our anniversary and we got a completely dessert, which we thought was a really nice gesture. Our waiter James, made our dinning experience great, he was very nice, he offered great recommendations for wine and dessert. James' great service made our lunch way better. We will be coming back for sure as well as recommending it to friends.",5
Top notch restaurant near Central Park. The fusilli is amazing!,5
Wow! This is probably the BEST Italian restaurant I've ever been to and beats the fine dining traditional Italian options in SF! ,5
"We came for lunch and honestly the price is an amazing steal; $52 for a 2 course lunch with fairly large portions! Pastas are $30, but are available in half portions as well. ",5
"For our apps the lobster was so perfect, sweet, succulent and tender and was matched perfectly with the house made burrata. The grilled octopus was tender with a nice char, and came with some wonderful purees (olive and balsamic vinegar I believe?). The pastas were amazing as well with a thoughtful flour composition that created textures to compliment the overall pasta dish. The red-wine braised octopus is indeed worthy of its laurels and is surprisingly hearty! The crab strozzapretti maintains the sweetness of the crab and is complimented with the tomato sauce. ",5
"I ordered scallops and they were so incredibly tender, juicy, and succulent in addition to being fairly large. I've seldom experienced scallops that melted in my mouth. ",3
"Service was great and bread was offered throughout the meal. We never felt rushed or pressured, or felt any condescending or rude vibes from our server. They have a phenomenal selection of Italian wines by the glass, premium Coravin selections, and a plethora of premium and affordable bottles on their Italian-driven wine list. We didn't try dessert as we were picking up some other stuff, but they all sounded great as well! ",5
I will definitely be returning and would recommend Marea to friends. I would even eat here 2x in one day! Marea is definitely a 'must go' whenever I'm in NY and I'm eager to return. I'm definitely excited to try Michael White's other restaurants now as well!,3
I came here for lunch with my husband. We always wanted to try this place but never got around to it. We had the rare opportunity to come here sans kid but it seems we didn't need to worry about kids because there were plenty of people dining with their children.  The food was amazing. We had always heard the food was great and it  met all the expectations we had. We had the grilled octopus and tartare as appetizer and the taglioloni and the fusilli for the entree and it was absolutely delicious. The food does not disappoint!  The service was great and dessert was just as good!  We will definitely come back again and try the dinner menu!,5
It was my wife's bday and My wife loved the octopus menu and the bone marrow pasta! Thank you for a wonderful experience!,5
"On Sunday, July 2, 2017 (my 70th birthday), my wife and I had dinner there.  It was excellent.  The food and the service were perfect.  We had the prix fixe menu.  It was our first time there.  The meal is very rich.  We had to pace ourselves.  We had Branzino.   Our server suggested that we could some of that to our home.  For my dessert, I got a candle to celebrate my birthday.  This deserves three stars!",5
This restaurant is absolutely fantastic. The food is spectacular and the service excellent. Would go there often if we lived in NYC. Will be our first choice when we return.,5
This was the great culinary experience in NYC for me. The food was great and the service amazing. I would definitely come back and recommend it.,5
Doesn't get much better.  One of the best in NYC!,3
"Way over priced for what you get. I love Anthony Bourdain, but I don't see what he saw in this place. The waiter never checked on us after we got our food. $76 for two skinny pieces of sole is insane unless it's the best piece of fish you've ever had. It was not. Pasta was delicious, however. Wine was good. The man greeting us when we walked in was very nice. For $250, I expect more, though.",4
We love Marea. It is to Italian seafood as Le Bernardin is to French seafood,5
Wonderful,5
"Seafood is wonderful, all fish and scallop dishes are tasty.",1
This is our third time dining at Marea and it did not disappoint. It is very expensive and is best for a special night; but worth it if you are a foodie and love wine. The service is very good and unobtrusive. We will be back for another special night!,4
This is simply one of the best Italian restaurants in New York.,5
"Great food, great service, classy surroundings, quiet for conversation. Vegetables should be included with the main course. I always feel totally ripped-off when paying a high price for a meal and somehow get less.",5
Delicious!!!,4
"Muy recomendable, excelente comida y servicio, igualmente valor por tu dinero bastante accesible vs otras opciones de este nivel",3
"Food was just ok. halibut, very dry and served with a teeny prep of sauce and basically nothing. biggest problem was the very cool AC blowing on me. Asked 4 different people to turn it down. never happened and they gave attitude about it.",2
"Still great because of amazing fish. But  service is slipping. No longer creates the pampered - we bring what you want before you know you want it - feeling. Waitress was inattentive and clearly asked how things were going because it's her job, not because she cared. (I'm sure that was sometimes true in the past but one never got that feeling.) An example, there was artificial sweetener but no sugar on our table and although it was brought promptly, there was no sense of embarrassment that the table setting had been incomplete. The problem goes beyond the waitstaff to management which should provide oversight, training and hire better. Maybe they  should be sent to Dovetail for bootcamp training.",5
Perfect experience each time.,5
Somos clientes frecuentes de Marea y cada vez que vamos nos gusta mas !! Esta vez fuimos muy bien recibidos desde la recepción y muy bien atendidos en especial por los ayudantes Mexicanos !! La comida Excelente como siempre .El pulpo fue sensacional  y el Pez Espada  excelente !! ,5
Es una garantia visitar Marea,3
"The staff was extremely rude. upon arrival for dinner we were told that we 2.5 hours for the table.  The wait staff was snooty.  There is no substance to Marea, spend your money elsewhere.",5
"Visiting Marea for the second time and the food was as good as we remembered. Outstanding service, excellent seafood , great wine list, nice bar scene.",5
